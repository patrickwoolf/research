TI  - Adenine-induced chronic kidney disease in rats.
PG  - 5-11
LID - 10.1111/nep.13180 [doi]
AB  - Many animal models have been developed to study the causes and treatments of chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) in humans, an insidious disease resulting from kidney injury 
      and characterized by persistent functional decline for more than 3 months, with or 
      without evidence of structural deficit. The eventual outcome of CKD may be end-stage 
      kidney disease (ESKD), where patients need dialysis or transplantation to survive. 
      Cardiovascular disease is accelerated in patients with CKD and contributes to 
      increased mortality, with the relationship between CKD and cardiovascular disease 
      being bi-directional. Most animal models do not mimic the complexity of the human 
      disease as many do not develop CKD-associated cardiovascular disease. The adenine 
      diet model of CKD in rodents is an exception. The original adenine diet model 
      produced rapid-onset kidney disease with extensive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, 
      tubular atrophy, crystal formation and marked vessel calcification. Since then, 
      lower adenine intake in rats has been found to induce slowly progressive kidney 
      damage and cardiovascular disease. These chronic adenine diet models allow the 
      characterization of relatively stable kidney and cardiovascular disease, similar to 
      CKD in humans. In addition, interventions for reversal can be tested. Here the key 
      features of the adenine diet model of CKD are noted, along with some limitations of 
      other available models. In summary, the data presented here support the use of 
      chronic low-dose adenine diet in rats as an easy and effective model for 
      understanding human CKD, especially the links with cardiovascular disease, and 
      developing potential therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among 
      Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.0363 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in 
      dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are sparse 
      data on the association of CAC with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease and 
      all-cause mortality in this population. OBJECTIVE: To study the prospective 
      association of CAC with risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among 
      dialysis-naive patients with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective 
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study recruited adults with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 7 clinical centers in the 
      United States. There were 1541 participants without cardiovascular disease at 
      baseline who had CAC scores. EXPOSURES: Coronary artery calcification was assessed 
      using electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incidence of cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction, 
      heart failure, and stroke) and all-cause mortality were reported every 6 months and 
      confirmed by medical record adjudication. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 
      5.9 years in 1541 participants aged 21 to 74 years, there were 188 cardiovascular 
      disease events (60 cases of myocardial infarction, 120 heart failures, and 27 
      strokes; patients may have had >1 event) and 137 all-cause deaths. In Cox 
      proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, education 
      level, physical activity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive treatment, 
      current cigarette smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, C-reactive protein 
      level, hemoglobin A1c level, phosphorus level, troponin T level, log N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, fibroblast growth factor 23 level, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, the hazard ratios associated with per 1 
      SD log of CAC were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.69; P < .001) for cardiovascular disease, 
      1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-2.02; P = .04) for myocardial infarction, 1.39 (95% CI, 
      1.10-1.76; P = .006) for heart failure, and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94-1.51; P = .15) for 
      all-cause mortality. In addition, inclusion of CAC score led to an increase in the C 
      statistic of 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.09; P < .001) for predicting cardiovascular disease 
      over use of all the above-mentioned established and novel cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Coronary artery calcification is 
      independently and significantly related to the risks of cardiovascular disease, 
      myocardial infarction, and heart failure in patients with CKD. In addition, CAC 
      improves risk prediction for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and 
      heart failure over use of established and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors 
      among patients with CKD; however, the changes in the C statistic are small.

TI  - A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study of long-term and incident hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 615-626
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00593-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular morphology and function in long-term survivors of 
      hemodialysis are not well described. METHODS: Single-center cross-sectional study 
      nested within a prospective cohort study of 15 long-term (> 7.5 years) and 15 
      matched incident (< 6 months) hemodialysis patients with 15 external matched 
      controls. Evaluations included heart structure, function and fibrosis (myocardial 
      longitudinal relaxation time, native T1), and aortic dimensions and elasticity, 
      using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      scores were evaluated from computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Incident hemodialysis 
      patients had significantly increased left ventricular mass, greater aortic 
      dimensions and reduced aortic distensibility compared to long-term survivors, 
      whereas the CAC score was significantly higher in long-term than incident patients, 
      median (95% CI) 1127 (10-3861) vs 14 (0-268). Both incident and long-term 
      hemodialysis groups had significantly higher native T1 values compared to controls, 
      mean (95% CI) 1300 ms (1273-1326), 1274 ms (1243-1305) versus 1224 ms (1202-1246), 
      respectively, suggesting interstitial fibrosis or edema. Compared to controls, both 
      hemodialysis groups also had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction: 
      48.7% (43.6-53.9), 54.0% (48.3-59.7) versus 62.2% (58.0-66.4) and longitudinal 
      strain: 14.0% (11.7-16.2), 15.2% (12.7-17.7) versus 19.6% (17.8-21.5). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Incident hemodialysis patients had larger left ventricular mass and unfavorable 
      aortic structure and function compared to long-term survivors, despite a lower CAC 
      burden. Long-term survivors, despite normal ventricular mass and volumes, had signs 
      of fibrosis or edema, given their significantly increased native T1 values.

TI  - Vitamin K2 supplementation and arterial stiffness among renal transplant 
      recipients-a single-arm, single-center clinical trial.

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and 
      is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the 
      association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial stiffness 
      has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING trial (vitamin K2 
      In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the association between the 
      change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial stiffness following 8 weeks of 
      menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360 μg once daily) among renal 
      transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness was measured using 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical vitamin K deficiency was 
      defined as plasma concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla 
      protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had 
      subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% 
      reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV 
      post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 ± 1.5 m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also 
      significantly reduced by 55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a 
      reduction in the prevalence of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When 
      controlled for age, durations of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 
      24-hour mean arterial pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was 
      independently associated with the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration 
      (P = .014).Among renal transplant recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 
      supplementation was associated with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency 
      and arterial stiffness. (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02517580).

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
      kidney function and arterial calcification in major vascular beds and to establish 
      whether arterial calcification mediates the relation between kidney function 
      measures and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence. Methods and Results In 2241 
      participants from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69 years, 52% female), kidney 
      function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio. All participants underwent noncontrast computed 
      tomography to quantify the amount of arterial calcification in the coronary 
      arteries, aortic arch, extracranial, and intracranial internal carotid arteries. We 
      used linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors, to evaluate the association between kidney function and arterial 
      calcification volume in the 4 vessel beds. Incidence rate of CVD was calculated in 3 
      groups of participants based on their kidney function and presence of arterial 
      calcification. We conducted mediation analysis to evaluate whether arterial 
      calcification mediates this association. We found that in age- and sex-adjusted 
      models, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin-to-creatinine 
      ratio were associated with larger calcification volumes in all 4 vascular beds. 
      Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the effect estimates. CVD 
      incidence was higher in participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and presence of arterial calcification compared with 
      individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 and no calcification. 
      After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, arterial calcification did not 
      mediate the association between kidney function measures and CVD incidence. 
      Conclusions The association of impaired kidney function and larger volumes of 
      arterial calcification is partly explained by cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial 
      calcification does not mediate the association between kidney function and CVD 
      beyond cardiovascular risk factors.

PG  - 422-434
LID - 10.1111/joim.13012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5) are predisposed to 
      vascular calcification (VC), but the combined effect of factors associated with VC 
      was sparsely investigated. We applied the relaxed linear separability (RLS) feature 
      selection model to identify features that concomitantly associate with VC in CKD5 
      patients. METHODS: Epigastric arteries collected during surgery from living donor 
      kidney transplant recipients were examined to score the histological extent of 
      medial VC. Sixty-two phenotypic features in 152 patients were entered into RLS model 
      to differentiate between no-minimal VC (n = 93; score 0-1) and moderate-extensive VC 
      (n = 59; score 2-3). The subset of features associated with VC was selected on the 
      basis of cross-validation procedure. The strength of association of the selected 
      features with VC was expressed by the absolute value of 'RLS factor'. RESULTS: Among 
      62 features, a subset of 17 features provided optimal prediction of VC with 89% of 
      patients correctly classified into their groups. The 17 features included 
      traditional risk factors (diabetes, age, cholesterol, BMI and male sex) and markers 
      of bone metabolism, endothelial function, metabolites, serum antibodies and 
      mitochondrial-derived peptide. Positive RLS factors range from 1.26 to 4.05 
      indicating features associated with increased risk of VC, and negative RLS factors 
      range from -0.95 to -1.83 indicating features associated with reduced risk of VC. 
      CONCLUSION: The RLS model identified 17 features including novel biomarkers and 
      traditional risk factors that together concomitantly associated with medial VC. 
      These results may inform further investigations of factors promoting VC in CKD5 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with 
      systemic calcified atherosclerosis, other than the coronary arteries, has not been 
      clearly elucidated. We investigated the association between NAFLD and calcification 
      in eight different vascular beds. METHODS: In a community-based cohort with computed 
      tomography scans for carotid artery, coronary artery, thoracic aorta, abdominal 
      aorta, iliac artery, renal artery, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery, the 
      association between NAFLD and arterial calcification was evaluated with adjustment 
      for age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, current smoking status, 
      and family history of heart disease in the first-degree relatives. RESULTS: In age- 
      and sex-adjusted models, NAFLD was significantly associated with calcification in 
      the coronary artery, carotid artery, thoracic aorta, celiac trunk, and superior 
      mesenteric artery vascular beds (P < .05). However, adjustment for the traditional 
      chronic venous disease risk factors attenuated the associations, except in the case 
      of the thoracic aorta (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.09-1.78) and celiac trunk (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.16-3.65). In addition, NAFLD was 
      independently associated with multiarterial calcification (four or more [OR, 1.33; 
      95% CI, 1.01-1.74], five or more [OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97], and six or more [OR, 
      1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.30] of eight evaluated arterial segments). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      association between NAFLD and arterial calcification is mainly mediated by 
      conventional risk factors. The independent association between NAFLD and 
      calcification in the thoracic aorta and celiac trunk as well as in a larger number 
      of vascular beds needs confirmation in future prospective studies in diverse 
      populations.

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 on progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in 
      nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5.
PG  - 631-40
LID - AOP_15_066 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of vitamin 
      K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and vascular 
      calcification. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of vitamin K2 substitution on the 
      progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD 
      stages 3-5. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 42 nondialyzed patients with 
      CKD. The following measurements were taken at baseline and after 270 ±12 days of 
      supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose of 90 μg (menaquinone, MK-7) together with 
      10 μg of cholecalciferol (K+D group) or 10 μg of cholecalciferol (group D): common 
      carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS), basic biochemical parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix 
      Gla protein (MGP), desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), fetuin A, osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23. RESULTS: The 
      increase of CCA-IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D 
      group: from 0.95 ±0.2 mm to 1.01 ±0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 ±0.2 mm to 1.16 ±0.3, 
      P = 0.003 (ΔCCA-IMT, 0.06 ±0.08 vs 0.136 ±0.05 mm, P = 0.005, respectively). The 
      increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in the D group (ΔCACS, 
      58.1 ±106.5 AU vs 74.4 ±127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the K+D group, a significant decrease 
      in the level of dp-ucMGP and total OC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 270-day course of 
      vitamin K2 administration in patients with CKD stages 3-5 may reduce the progression 
      of atherosclerosis, but does not significantly affect the progression of 
      calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly changes the levels of calcification 
      promoters and inhibitors: dp-ucMGP, OC, and OPG.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with an increased 
      cardiovascular mortality, but mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. 
      The goal of this study was to evaluate coronary artery calcifications via the 
      coronary calcification score in primary hyperparathyroidism patients, to compare 
      with control subjects, and to identify risk factors for high to intermediate risk 
      coronary calcification scores (coronary calcification score >100). METHOD: 
      Cross-sectional study of primary hyperparathyroidism patients without a history of 
      coronary artery disease, diabetes, or severe, chronic kidney disease. Coronary 
      calcification scores were compared with a cohort of population-based control 
      subjects. RESULTS: The mean coronary calcification score was 120 ± 344 in 130 
      primary hyperparathyroidism patients. The coronary calcification score was >100 in 
      27 patients (21%). When compared with control subjects, the percentage of positive 
      coronary calcification scores was similar in primary hyperparathyroidism patients 
      (53% vs 50%); however, positive coronary calcification scores were at the 67(th) 
      percentile of the control subjects cohort (P < .001). In multivariable regression, 
      patient age (1.1; 1.1-1.2; P < .001), patients in the mild normocalcemic primary 
      hyperparathyroidism group (5.1; 1.1-22.6; P = .037), and the need for 
      antihypertensive medications (6.1; 1.8-20.9; P < .001) remained independent 
      predictors for a coronary calcification score >100. CONCLUSION: Positive coronary 
      calcification scores were greater in primary hyperparathyroidism patients than in 
      population-based control subjects. These study data may provide new criteria for 
      parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

TI  - Association between coronary tortuosity and mitral annular calcification.
PG  - 75-78
LID - 10.5830/CVJA-2018-068 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary tortuosity (CorT) is a common coronary angiographic finding. 
      The aetiology, clinical implication and long-term prognosis are not well clarified. 
      Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is one of the most common cardiac structural 
      abnormalities on echocardiographic examination. MAC and CorT are associated with 
      atherosclerotic risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
      hypercholesterolaemia, female gender and chronic kidney disease. There are few data 
      on the co-existence of MAC and CorT in the literature. This study was conducted with 
      the aim of evaluating the association between CorT and MAC. METHODS: The medical 
      records of consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography were 
      retrospectively reviewed. The study group consisted of 2 736 patients. Taking into 
      consideration the inclusion criteria, 392 patients with MAC and 687 patients without 
      MAC (control group) were included in the study. Biochemical, clinical and 
      echocardiographic parameters and CorT were evaluated in all patients. CorT was 
      defined as three fixed bends during both systole and diastole, with the angle of 
      each bend 45° or more. RESULTS: Patients with MAC had a higher prevalence of 
      hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, female gender, MAC and advanced age. On univariate 
      analysis, advanced age, hypertension, female gender, hyperlipidaemia and MAC were 
      associated with CorT. On multivariate analysis MAC, advanced age and hypertension 
      were independent predictors for CorT (OR 2.167, 95% CI: 1.436-4.283, p < 0.001; OR 
      1.243, 95% CI: 1.243-3.674, p < 0.001; OR 2.358, 95% CI: 1.864-4.681, p < 0.001, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found a significant relationship 
      between MAC and CorT.

TI  - Effect of cinacalcet on cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 2482-94
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1205624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disorders of mineral metabolism, including secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, are thought to contribute to extraskeletal (including vascular) 
      calcification among patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been hypothesized 
      that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet might reduce the risk of death 
      or nonfatal cardiovascular events in such patients. METHODS: In this clinical trial, 
      we randomly assigned 3883 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism (median level of intact parathyroid hormone, 693 pg per 
      milliliter [10th to 90th percentile, 363 to 1694]) who were undergoing hemodialysis 
      to receive either cinacalcet or placebo. All patients were eligible to receive 
      conventional therapy, including phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols, or both. The 
      patients were followed for up to 64 months. The primary composite end point was the 
      time until death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart 
      failure, or a peripheral vascular event. The primary analysis was performed on the 
      basis of the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The median duration of 
      study-drug exposure was 21.2 months in the cinacalcet group, versus 17.5 months in 
      the placebo group. The primary composite end point was reached in 938 of 1948 
      patients (48.2%) in the cinacalcet group and 952 of 1935 patients (49.2%) in the 
      placebo group (relative hazard in the cinacalcet group vs. the placebo group, 0.93; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.11). Hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal 
      adverse events were significantly more frequent in patients receiving cinacalcet. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not 
      significantly reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular events in patients 
      with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who were undergoing dialysis.

LID - 861
AB  - Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) detected on lateral vertebral fracture 
      assessment is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin D deficiency 
      and toxicity have been linked with vascular calcification. The objective of this 
      study was to determine the effect of high-dose vitamin D on the progression of AAC. 
      The Physical Performance, Osteoporosis and vitamin D in African American Women 
      (PODA) is a randomized, clinical trial examining the effect of vitamin D. There were 
      14.7% subjects with AAC in the vitamin D group, compared to 12.1% in the placebo 
      group at baseline. The prevalence of extended AAC at baseline was 6.4% in the 
      vitamin D group and 3.5% in the placebo group. The extended calcification scores 
      over time were not different between groups. There was no association between AAC 
      and serum 25(OH)D. However, PTH was associated with an increase in AAC in the 
      placebo group.

TI  - Vascular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients: 
      interrelationship and clinical impacts.
PG  - 557-563
LID - 10.7150/ijms.23700 [doi]
AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular 
      calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and 
      cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance HD 
      patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest radiographs 
      were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 100 patients 
      (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC 
      (70% vs. 50.2%, P=0.001). VC was independently associated with a 2.42-fold increased 
      risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients 
      with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was independently associated 
      with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or LVH alone was not. Patients 
      with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a composite event of deaths or CVE 
      (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant synergistic interaction was observed 
      between VC and LVH (P for interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently 
      associated with LVH. The coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk 
      of deaths and CVEs than either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic 
      interaction for the risk of deaths and CVEs.

TI  - Coronary calcification as a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in advanced 
      chronic kidney disease: a prospective long-term follow-up study.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1367-1 [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit higher 
      prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CaC) than general population. CaC has 
      been proposed as a risk factor for mortality in end-stage CKD, but most studies in 
      the field are based on short-term follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a cohort, 10-year 
      prospective longitudinal study of consecutive cases referred to the renal unit. A 
      non-enhanced multislice coronary computed tomography was performed at baseline. CaC 
      was assessed by Agatston method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC 
      score: severe calcification group (CaCs< 400 HU) and mild-moderate calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400 HU). The overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, CV events, and 
      factors potentially associated with CaC development were recorded. RESULTS: 137 
      patients with advanced CKD were enrolled and provided consent. Overall mortality 
      rate was 58%; 40% due to CV events. The rate of overall mortality in the severe 
      calcification group was 75%, and 30% in the low calcification group, whereas the 
      rate of CV mortality was 35% vs. 6%, respectively (p < 0.001). The severe 
      calcification group was older, had higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      former cardiologic events, and lower albumin serum levels than the mild-moderate 
      calcification group. In a multivariate Cox model, severe CaC was a significant 
      predictor of CV mortality (HR 5.01; 95%CI 1.28 to 19.6, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Among advanced CKD, there was a significantly increase of CV mortality in patients 
      with severe CaCs during a 10-year follow-up period. CaCs could be a useful 
      prognostic tool to predict CV mortality risk in CKD patients.

TI  - Association between Aortic Calcification, Cardiovascular Events, and Mortality in 
      Kidney and Pancreas-Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 177-186
LID - 10.1159/000502328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) 
      score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. METHODS: Between the 
      years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored 
      for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, 
      cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC 
      (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 
      months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. 
      For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and 
      mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar 
      after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and 
      diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high 
      versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 
      (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), 
      and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking 
      history-adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with 
      high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than 
      recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted 
      risk-lowering strategies.

TI  - Surgical outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection in dialysis patients.
PG  - 501-509
LID - 10.1007/s11748-018-1051-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is relatively uncommon in 
      dialysis patients, and characteristics and repair outcomes are not fully understood. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ATAAD (n = 960) were divided into a dialysis 
      group (n = 19) and non-dialysis group (n = 941), depending on whether they required 
      dialysis for preoperative end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hospital charts and 
      imaging data were reviewed, and characteristics and outcomes were compared between 
      the groups. Segmental aortic wall or intima/media flap calcification in the thoracic 
      and abdominal aorta was assessed in the dialysis patients. RESULTS: The leading 
      primary causes of ESRD were polycystic kidney disease (n = 5) and chronic 
      glomerulonephritis (n = 5). There were no significant differences (dialysis group 
      vs. non-dialysis group) in age (60.5 vs. 64.5 years), preoperative hemodynamics, or 
      organ ischemia. Dialysis patients were more likely to have an entry tear in the 
      aortic arch (42% vs. 15%, p = 0.003). These patients showed moderate-to-severe 
      calcification (multiple focal or single focal calcification > 10 mm) in the 
      ascending aorta (17%), aortic arch (61%), descending aorta (67%), and abdominal 
      aorta (83%). Arch replacement was common in this group (37% vs. 18%, p = 0.030). 
      Although in-hospital mortality was increased in this group (21% vs. 7%, p = 0.059), 
      morbidities did not differ significantly. Six-year survival was 60.3 ± 13.4% and 
      78.8 ± 1.6%, respectively (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis patients tend to have 
      aortic calcification and a primary tear in the aortic arch. Outcomes are acceptable.

TI  - Chemerin inhibits vascular calcification through ChemR23 and is associated with 
      lower coronary calcium in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.1111/joim.12940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemerin is an adipokine that signals through the G protein-coupled 
      receptor ChemR23 and is associated with inflammation, glucose homeostasis, lipid 
      metabolism and renal function, all of which strongly influence cardiovascular risk. 
      However, elevated chemerin provides a survival advantage in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), but how this relates to the cardiovascular phenotype is 
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to establish the association 
      of chemerin with coronary calcification and to determine the effects of chemerin 
      signalling, through ChemR23, in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. 
      METHODS: Plasma chemerin was measured in 113 patients with CKD and 50 healthy 
      controls. All patients underwent computed tomography to determine coronary artery 
      calcium (CAC) score. VSMCs were isolated from wild-type and ChemR23 knock-out mice 
      and treated with chemerin. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses established creatinine, 
      cholesterol, body mass index and tumour necrosis factor as significant confounders 
      for circulating chemerin levels. Despite these positive associations with renal 
      function, cardiometabolic risk factors and inflammation, chemerin was inversely 
      associated with CAC both in an age- and sex-adjusted analysis and in a multivariate 
      analysis adjusting for the aforementioned confounders. In addition, circulating 
      chemerin levels were associated with the calcification inhibitors matrix gla protein 
      (MGP) and fetuin-A. Finally, chemerin significantly reduced phosphate-induced 
      calcification and increased MGP expression in VSMCs, whereas chemerin was devoid of 
      these effects in VSMCs lacking ChemR23. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results 
      suggest that chemerin signalling through ChemR23 in VSMCs protects against vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

TI  - Does statins promote vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 137-148
LID - 10.1111/eci.12718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve 
      survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is 
      unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and 
      mortality in ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; 
      median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal 
      dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor 
      (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated 
      in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism. 
      RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate 
      analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, 
      male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and 
      mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use 
      of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 
      patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. 
      In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. 
      CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of 
      inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular 
      calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

PG  - 1479164120958425
LID - 10.1177/1479164120958425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary arterial plaques in patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) are assumed to have increased calcification due to underlying renal disease 
      or initiation of dialysis. This relationship may be confounded by comorbid type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: From a single-center OCT registry, 60 patients were 
      analyzed. Twenty patients with ESRD and diabetes (ESRD-DM) were compared to 2 groups 
      of non-ESRD patients: 20 with and 20 without diabetes. In each patient, one 20 mm 
      segment within the culprit vessel was analyzed. RESULTS: ESRD-DM patients exhibited 
      similar calcium burden, arc, and area compared to patients with diabetes alone. When 
      compared to patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes exhibited a greater 
      summed area of calcium (DM: Median 9.0, IQR [5.3-28] mm(2) vs Non-DM: 3.5 [0.1-14] 
      mm(2), p = 0.04) and larger calcium deposits by arc (DM: Mean 45 ± SE 6.2° vs 
      Non-DM: 21 ± 6.2°, p = 0.01) and area (DM: 0.58 ± 0.10 mm(2) vs Non-DM: 
      0.26 ± 0.10 mm(2), p = 0.03). Calcification deposits in ESRD-DM patients 
      (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) and patients with diabetes (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) were more superficially 
      located relative to patients without diabetes (0.21 ± 0.02 mm), p = 0.01 for both. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary calcification in DM and ESRD-DM groups exhibited similar 
      burden, deposit size, and depth within the arterial wall. The increase in coronary 
      calcification and cardiovascular disease events seen in ESRD-DM patients may not be 
      secondary to ESRD and dialysis, but instead due to a combination of declining renal 
      function and diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of cardiac events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients are predicted by coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      independently. It is not clear to what extent low bone mineral density (BMD) is 
      associated with higher risk of CAC and if sex interacts. We investigated the 
      sex-specific associations of CAC score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with 
      BMD of different skeletal sub-regions. METHODS: In 174 ESRD patients, median age 57 
      (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63% males, BMD (measured by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac CT) and circulating 
      inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 104 (60%) patients with 
      CAC > 100 AUs were older, had higher prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, 
      higher level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, 
      interleukin-6 and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower 
      tBMD and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients. Female 
      patients with high CAC (> 100 AUs) had significantly decreased T-score of tBMD, and 
      lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC (≤ 100 AUs); elevated CAC score were 
      associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no 
      such differences was observed in males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) 
      analysis adjusted for age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher 
      CAC score (1057 AUs) was predicted by either per SD (0.13 g/cm(2)) lower tBMD or per 
      SD (0.17 g/cm(2)) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found in male ESRD 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In female, but not male, lower BMD, in particular sub-regions 
      of legs, was associated with higher CAC score independently. Low BMD has the 
      potential to identify increased risk for high CAC score in ESRD patients.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Fetuin-A: Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease in 
      Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1159/000491025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "T50," shortened transformation time from primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein fetuin-A 
      is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid For Vascular Outcome Prevention 
      In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled 
      clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We 
      conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly selected subcohort of 
      patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum T50 and fetuin-A were 
      determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. 
      RESULTS: During a median surveillance of 2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD 
      events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were 
      associated with CVD after adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood 
      pressure, age, sex, race, preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, 
      total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin 
      inhibitor, or lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 
      urinary albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, 
      T50, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI 
      1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect 
      modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as reduced 
      fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained associated 
      with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD risk factors, 
      measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical characteristics and 
      demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term KTRs. Increased hsCRP was 
      an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and active mineralization are key 
      processes involved in cardiovascular burden in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Serum 
      (soluble) thrombomodulin (sTM) is an established marker of endothelial injury. 
      PATIENTS: 80 patients in ESRD were recruited consecutively. Baseline distribution of 
      sex, age, main comorbidities and Framingham score was similar. A biochemical panel 
      including sTM, intact PTH (iPTH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), 
      osteocalcin (OC), osteonectin (ON), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 
      (TNFR2), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), 
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (sVEGFR2) and stromal 
      cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α) was investigated in each patient. Samples obtained 
      while establishing haemodialysis (HD) access were stained for radial artery 
      calcifications (RACs) with Alizarin red and examined histologically. RESULTS: After 
      adjustment for HD status, sTM showed a significant positive correlation with serum 
      creatinine, TNFR2, OPN, HGF, SDF1α, sVEGFR2, Pi, iPTH, FGF-23, OPG, OC and ON. In 
      forward stepwise multiple regression, serum creatinine, TNFR2, and OPN were 
      identified as significant, independent predictors of sTM. Grades 1-3 of RACs 
      correlated with sTM (R = 0.50, p = 0.017), while grade 3 RACs were significantly 
      associated with higher sTM (p = 0.02) than less advanced lesions. CONCLUSION: Among 
      novel renal and cardiovascular biomarkers, OPN and TNFR2 are closely related to sTM. 
      This may link endothelial damage, vascular remodeling and inflammation. Progression 
      of RAC parallels a presumed compensatory rise in sTM, reflecting endothelial injury. 
      sTM has an intricate role in endothelial function and potential clinical and 
      prognostic applications.

TI  - Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12888 [doi]
AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification 
      score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 
      2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The 
      difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in the 
      external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total iliac 
      vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease, and 
      diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk factor 
      (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total iliac 
      vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation 
      protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to 
      calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular calcification prior to 
      transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical decisions and to improve 
      patient safety and outcome in increasingly older transplant recipients.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated associations of serum matrix Gla protein (MGP), 
      plasma vitamin K1, and plasma vitamin K2 with coronary artery calcium score (CACS) 
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. 
      Methods: Subjects comprised 112 MHD patients aged 30-60 years and 40 age-matched 
      healthy subjects. Total MGP, vitamin K1, vitamin K2, and lipid profile were examined 
      in all subjects; other clinical data, medication use, and CACS were assessed only in 
      MHD patients. Determinants of MGP in all subjects were identified by regression 
      analysis. Factors associated with CACS and CVD in MHD patients were identified by 
      regression analysis and logistic analysis, respectively. Results: Lower plasma 
      levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides [0.39 (0.24-0.70) vs. 0.77 
      (0.48-1.34) ng/mg, p < 0.001], higher frequency of plasma vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml 
      (p = 0.23), and higher serum total MGP (288.4 ± 44.2 vs. 159.7 ± 40.6 ng/ml, 
      p < 0.0001) were observed in MHD patients than in healthy controls. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides 
      (p <0 .001) and vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml (p < 0.05) in all subjects. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with presence of CVD (p <0 .05), but not CACS, in MHD 
      patients. Conclusion: The end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis is a deficiency 
      state of vitamin K. Total MGP was significantly higher in MHD patients compared to 
      healthy subjects and total MGP was associated with the presence of CVD, but not 
      CACS, in MHD patients.

TI  - Increased Aortic Arch Calcification and Cardiomegaly is Associated with Rapid Renal 
      Progression and Increased Cardiovascular Mortality in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 5354
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-41841-7 [doi]
LID - 5354
AB  - Vascular calcification and cardiomegaly are highly prevalent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. However, the association of the combination of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) with clinical outcomes in 
      patients with CKD is not well investigated. This study investigated whether the 
      combination of AoAC and CTR is associated with poor clinical outcomes in CKD stages 
      3-5 patients. We enrolled 568 CKD patients, and AoAC and CTR were determined by 
      chest radiography at enrollment. Rapid renal progression was defined as estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year. Both 
      AoAC score and CTR were significantly associated with rapid renal progression. High 
      CTR was correlated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. We stratified 
      the patients into four groups according to the median AoAC score of 4 and CTR of 
      50%. Those with AoAC ≥ 4 and CTR ≥ 50% (vs. AoAC score < 4 and CTR < 50%) were 
      associated with eGFR decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year and cardiovascular 
      mortality. AoAC and CTR were independently associated with eGFR slope. In 
      conclusion, the combination of increased AoAC and cardiomegaly was associated with 
      rapid renal progression and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD 
      stage 3-5 patients. We suggest that evaluating AoAC and CTR on chest plain 
      radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method for detecting CKD patients at 
      high risk for adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  - Cardiovascular Outcomes of Calcium-Free vs Calcium-Based Phosphate Binders in 
      Patients 65 Years or Older With End-stage Renal Disease Requiring Hemodialysis.
PG  - 741-749
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.0045 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Guidelines restricting use of calcium-based phosphate binders in all 
      patients with end-stage renal disease owing to their potential contribution to 
      increased cardiovascular risk shifted prescribing from calcium acetate toward the 
      costlier sevelamer carbonate products. OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiovascular events 
      and mortality between patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing 
      hemodialysis receiving sevelamer vs calcium acetate in real-world practice. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational cohort study was conducted using the 
      United States Renal Data System linked to Medicare claims data (May 1, 2012, to 
      December 31, 2013). Data analysis was performed from October 2017 to September 2018. 
      Participants included patients 65 years or older with ESRD within 180 days after 
      starting hemodialysis (sevelamer, 2647; calcium acetate, 2074). EXPOSURES: New use 
      of sevelamer (calcium-free phosphate binder) vs calcium acetate (calcium-based 
      phosphate binder). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were 
      estimated for fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or 
      ischemic stroke: primary outcome) and all-cause mortality (secondary outcome) using 
      Cox proportional hazards regression with fine stratification on the propensity score 
      to control for potential confounders, including phosphorus and calcium levels. 
      RESULTS: After propensity score weighting, 2639 patients initiating sevelamer 
      treatment (1184 men [44.9%]; mean [SD] age, 75.6 [6.9] years) and 2065 patients 
      initiating calcium acetate treatment (930 men [45.0%]; mean [SD] age, 75.5 [7.1] 
      years) were included in the analysis. Crude incidence rates (IRs) for cardiovascular 
      events of 458 per 1000 person-years for sevelamer and 464 per 1000 person-years for 
      calcium acetate were observed. After propensity score fine-stratification weighting, 
      HRs of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84-1.10) for cardiovascular events were observed. Results 
      were consistent within subgroups of age (<75 y: primary outcome, HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 
      0.85-1.24; vs ≥75 years: primary outcome, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-1.01) and sex 
      (primary outcome in men: HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      The results of the study do not suggest increased cardiovascular safety of sevelamer 
      in the routine clinical practice of patients with ESRD compared with calcium 
      acetate; this study's findings suggest that well-designed, long-term, randomized 
      clinical trials are needed.

TI  - Evolution of coronary artery calcifications following kidney transplantation: 
      relationship with osteoprotegerin levels.
PG  - 2571-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02814.x [doi]
AB  - We prospectively assessed the evolution of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels after renal transplantation (RT). Eighty-three 
      recipients were followed-up prospectively during 1 year. Blood was collected before 
      (baseline) and after RT for determination of mineral metabolism parameters including 
      OPG. CAC was measured by multidetector computed tomography at transplantation 
      (baseline) and 1 year later. Progression of CAC was defined as a difference between 
      the follow-up square-root transformed volume (SRV) and the baseline SRV >or= 2.5. By 
      multivariate analysis, baseline OPG level, age and low LDL levels were significantly 
      associated with baseline CAC. RT was accompanied by mineral metabolism improvement 
      with a decrease of OPG from 955 [395-5652] to 527 [217-1818] pg/mL and parathyroid 
      hormone from 94 [1-550] to 62 [16-410] pg/mL. Thirty-one percent of patients did not 
      exhibit CAC at baseline. CAC diminished in 14.5%, stabilized in 59.2% and progressed 
      in 26.3% of patients. Baseline CAC was associated with progression (OR 2.92 
      [1.02-8.36]). No significant association was found between OPG and CAC progression 
      despite a higher baseline OPG level in progressors (1046 [456-3285]) vs. 
      non-progressors (899 [396-5952] pg/mL). CAC at baseline, but not 1 year after RT, is 
      independently associated with baseline OPG; posttransplant CAC progression is 
      predicted by baseline CAC score.

TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from 
      cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play 
      a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify 
      CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe 
      hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 
      2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and 
      clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were 
      analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 
      patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 
      AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of 
      patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In 
      univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total 
      cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely 
      correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In 
      multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that 
      CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral 
      neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with 
      Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

TI  - Usefulness of pretransplant aortic arch calcification evaluation for kidney 
      transplant outcome prediction in one year follow-up.

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events and 
      hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We aimed 
      to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict 
      post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its 
      association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in 
      one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 
      kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two 
      radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa 
      et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The mismatching results were 
      repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and 
      carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry 
      before and one year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and 
      cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1 year. We found out that eGFR(1year) 
      correlated with eGFR(discharge) and calcium based on hospital discharge data 
      (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFR(discharge) 
      (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR(1year) than AoAC combined with 
      recipient eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four 
      (10.81%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV 
      ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In 
      conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE 
      rate within 1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray 
      together with recipient eGFR(discharge) could be related to kidney function in 
      one-year follow-up.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) 
      have high cardiovascular risk. Both conditions are related to systemic 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. The prevalence and severity of coronary 
      artery calcification (CaC) is higher in patients with DM, regardless of their renal 
      function. Data about the long-term prognostic role of CaC in diabetic patients with 
      CKD are scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective longitudinal 
      study enrolling 137 patients with advanced CKD. A non-enhanced multislice coronary 
      computed tomography (CT) was performed at baseline. CaC was assessed using Agatston 
      method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC score: severe calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400HU) and mild-moderate calcification group (CaCs<400HU). RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up time was 87.5 months. DM was found in 28% of subjects. The patients 
      with DM showed more severe CaC, lower albumin and higher C-reactive protein serum 
      levels. Serum albumin was correlated with severe CaC (r=-0.45, P=.009). Overall 
      mortality rate reached 58%. Patients with DM also tended to have higher mortality 
      compared to non-diabetic subjects (X(2) 3.51, P=.061) especially those with severe 
      CaC showed higher mortality than those with severe CaC without DM (93% vs.73%, 
      P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CKD and DM have more severe CaC, 
      increased inflammation-malnutrition data and higher mortality compared to those 
      without DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this population. 
      The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic calcification volume 
      (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 
      a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD 
      stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective observational study. At study 
      entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, 
      haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: 
      The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 
      m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 
      patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only 
      statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male 
      gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 
      0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently 
      associated with AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the 
      presence nor the extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change 
      in GFR during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 
      and 4, only age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not 
      associated with the rate of decline in GFR.

TI  - Plasma Complement Protein C3a Level Was Associated with Abdominal Aortic 
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.

AB  - The complement system plays an important role in cardiovascular disease in patients 
      on hemodialysis. Vascular calcification is also one of the major causes of 
      cardiovascular disease. We want to investigate the relationship between complement 
      activation and vascular calcification in dialyzed patients. One hundred eight 
      hemodialysis patients and 65 heathy controls were enrolled prospectively. Plasma 
      C3a, C5a, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) 
      levels were detected using ELISA. Plasma C3c, fB, fH, C1q, and C4 levels were 
      measured by immunity transmission turbidity. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      was measured by abdomen lateral plain radiograph, and the AAC score was calculated. 
      We identified increased level of MBL and decreased level of C3c and complement 
      factor B compared with normal control. However, C1q, complement factor H, and C4 
      levels remained at a similar level compared with individuals with normal renal 
      function. The C3a and C5a levels increased, without change of MAC. Forty two of 108 
      HD patients had the AAC score. C3a levels were correlated with AAC score (r = 0.461, 
      p = 0.002). The median C3a concentration was 238.72 (196.96, 323.41) ng/mL. When 
      evaluated as AAC categories (≤ 4, > 5) with ordinal logistic regression, univariate 
      analyses revealed that higher C3a levels were associated with severe AAC, while 
      multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and calcium level showed that higher 
      C3a levels (OR, 6.28 (1.25-31.69); p = 0.03) were associated with severe AAC. The 
      areas under the curve (AUC) for C3a to diagnose severe abdominal aortic 
      calcification were 0.75(0.58-0.92, 0.01). The complement system was activated in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Higher C3a levels are independently associated with severe 
      AAC. Plasma C3a might have a diagnostic value for the severe AAC in HD patients.

      Calcification in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 1554-1562
LID - 10.1159/000494441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed 
      the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray 
      examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
      biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients 
      with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited 
      lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
      associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
      AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
      dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
      circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were independently associated with AoAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with structural and functional 
      abnormality of the heart and blood vessels. We investigated the relationship between 
      intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients, and their impacts on cardiovascular events (CVEs). METHOD: We enrolled 191 
      maintenance HD patients who underwent plain abdomen radiography for abdominal aortic 
      calcification score (AACS). A nadir systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mm Hg or the 
      requirement of bolus fluid administration was required to quantify the hypotension 
      diagnosis. IDH was defined as > 2 hypotension episodes during 10 HD treatments. 
      RESULTS: Among the 191 patients, IDH occurred in 32. AACS was higher in the IDH 
      group compared with the no-IDH group (8.4 ± 6.0 vs. 4.9 ± 5.2, respectively; P = 
      0.001). High AACS was an independent risk factor after adjustment for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, ultrafiltration, diastolic BP, and calcium level (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 
      95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). Patients with both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 had the highest 
      cumulative CVE rate (27.9%, P = 0.008) compared with 11.2%, 12.5%, and 6% for those 
      with AACS ≧ 4 only, with IDH only, and neither, respectively. In multivariate 
      analysis, the presence of both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 was a significant predictor of CVE 
      (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.04-7.74, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: IDH is 
      associated with abdominal aortic calcification and is an independent risk factor for 
      IDH. Both IDH and high AACS were significant predictors of CVE.

TI  - Impact of serum 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol level on the prediction of severe coronary 
      artery calcification: an intravascular ultrasound study.
PG  - 69

LID - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (AG) blood level is considered a clinical 
      marker of postprandial hyperglycemia. Previous studies reported that 1,5-AG levels 
      were associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and coronary artery disease 
      (CAD). However, the association between 1,5-AG levels and coronary artery plaque in 
      patients with CAD is unclear. METHODS: This study included 161 patients who 
      underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for CAD. The culprit plaque 
      characteristics and the extent of coronary calcification, which was measured by the 
      angle of its arc, were assessed by preintervention intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). 
      Patients with chronic kidney disease or glycosylated hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 were excluded. 
      Patients were divided into 2 groups according to serum 1,5-AG levels (< 14.0 μg/mL 
      vs. ≥ 14 μg/mL). RESULTS: The total atheroma volume and the presence of 
      IVUS-attenuated plaque in the culprit lesions were similar between groups. Calcified 
      plaques were frequently observed in the low 1,5-AG group (p = 0.06). Compared with 
      the high 1,5-AG group, the low 1,5-AG group had significantly higher median maximum 
      calcification (144° vs. 107°, p = 0.03) and more frequent calcified plaques with a 
      maximum calcification angle of ≥ 180° (34.0% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.003). Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis showed that a low 1,5-AG level was a significant 
      predictor of a greater calcification angle (> 180°) (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.10-6.29, 
      p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low 1,5-AG level, which indicated postprandial 
      hyperglycemia, was associated with the severity of coronary artery calcification. 
      Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of postprandial hyperglycemia on 
      coronary artery calcification.

      disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Proteomic profiling of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients could 
      lead to improved risk prediction and novel insights into cardiovascular disease 
      mechanisms. Plasma levels of 92 cardiovascular disease-associated proteins were 
      assessed by proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD-1, Olink Bioscience, 
      Uppsala, Sweden) in a discovery cohort of dialysis patients, the Mapping of 
      Inflammatory Markers in Chronic Kidney disease cohort [MIMICK; n = 183, 55% women, 
      mean age 63 years, 46 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up (mean 43 months)]. 
      Significant results were replicated in the incident and prevalent hemodialysis arm 
      of the Salford Kidney Study [SKS dialysis study, n = 186, 73% women, mean age 
      62 years, 45 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up (mean 12 months)], and in the 
      CKD5-LD-RTxcohort with assessments of coronary artery calcium (CAC)-score by cardiac 
      computed tomography (n = 89, 37% women, mean age 46 years). RESULTS: In age and 
      sex-adjusted Cox regression in MIMICK, 11 plasma proteins were nominally associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality (in order of significance: Kidney injury molecule-1 
      (KIM-1), Matrix metalloproteinase-7, Tumour necrosis factor receptor 2, 
      Interleukin-6, Matrix metalloproteinase-1, Brain-natriuretic peptide, ST2 protein, 
      Hepatocyte growth factor, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-2, 
      Spondin-1, and Fibroblast growth factor 25). Only plasma KIM-1 was associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality after correction for multiple testing, but also after 
      adjustment for dialysis vintage, cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation 
      (hazard ratio) per standard deviation (SD) increase 1.84, 95% CI 1.26-2.69, 
      p = 0.002. Addition of KIM-1, or nine of the most informative proteins to an 
      established risk-score (modified AROii CVM-score) improved discrimination of 
      cardiovascular mortality risk from C = 0.777 to C = 0.799 and C = 0.823, 
      respectively. In the SKS dialysis study, KIM-1 predicted cardiovascular mortality in 
      age and sex adjusted models (hazard ratio per SD increase 1.45, 95% CI 1.03-2.05, 
      p = 0.034) and higher KIM-1 was associated with higher CACscores in the 
      CKD5-LD-RTx-cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomics approach identified plasma KIM-1 as 
      a risk marker for cardiovascular mortality and coronary artery calcification in 
      three independent ESRD-cohorts. The improved risk prediction for cardiovascular 
      mortality by plasma proteomics merit further studies.

TI  - Cigarette Smoking is Associated with Decreased Bone Gla-protein (BGP) Levels in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 603-609

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-protein (BGP or osteocalcin) is a 
      vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. 
      Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis. METHODS: We carried out a secondary 
      analysis of the Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) study to investigate the association 
      between cigarette smoking and BGP levels in patients with end stage renal disease. 
      Data were collected in 370 haemodialysis patients, 37% (136) smokers (or ex-smokers) 
      and 63% (234) nonsmokers. Vascular calcifications and vertebral fractures 
      (quantitative morphometry) were identified on spine radiographs. RESULTS: Smokers 
      had significantly lower BGP levels (152 vs. 204 µg/L, p=0.003). Smokers had lower 
      plasma phosphate levels (4.2 vs. 4.7 mg/dl, p<0.01). Lower BGP levels were 
      associated with aortic calcification (p<0.001), iliac calcification (p=0.042) and 
      vertebral fractures (p=0.023). In addition, the regression model showed that smoking 
      is associated with a significant reduction of total BGP levels by about 18% 
      (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical study in a haemodialysis 
      population, which identifies cigarette smoking as a potential factor that can lower 
      BGP levels, a protective agent in bone and vascular health.

LID - e0185296
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common and may affect cardiac function in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about the 
      effect of residual renal function on vascular calcification and cardiac function in 
      patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: This study was conducted between January 2014 and 
      January 2017. One hundred six patients with residual renal function on maintenance 
      hemodialysis for 3 months were recruited. We used residual renal urea clearance 
      (KRU) to measure residual renal function. First, abdominal aortic calcification 
      score (AACS) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Second, we performed echocardiography and investigated new 
      cardiovascular events after study enrollment. RESULTS: The median KRU was 0.9 
      (0.3-2.5) mL/min/1.73m2. AACS (4.0 [1.0-10.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0-8.0], p = 0.05) and baPWV 
      (1836.1 ± 250.4 vs. 1676.8 ± 311.0 cm/s, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in 
      patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2. Log-KRU 
      significantly negatively correlated with log-AACS (ß = -0.29, p = 0.002) and baPWV 
      (ß = -0.19, P = 0.05) after factor adjustment. The proportion of left ventricular 
      diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 
      mL/min/1.73m2 than with a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (67.9% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.05). 
      Patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 showed a higher tendency of cumulative 
      cardiovascular events compared to those with a KRU ≥ 0.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (P = 0.08). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Residual renal function was significantly associated with vascular 
      calcification and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease have an extremely high risk of 
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased mortality 
      from CVD. METHODS: The present study aimed to investigate the risk factors for CAC 
      in Korean patients with incident dialysis. Data on 423 patients with ESRD who 
      started dialysis therapy between December 2012 and March 2014 were obtained from 10 
      university-affiliated hospitals. CAC was identified by using noncontrast-enhanced 
      cardiac multidetector computed tomography. The CAC score was calculated according to 
      the Agatston score, with CAC-positive subjects defined by an Agatston score >0. 
      FINDINGS: Patients' mean age was 55.6 ± 14.6 years, and 64.1% were men. The 
      CAC-positive rate was 63.8% (270 of 423). Results of univariate analyses showed 
      significant differences in age, sex, etiology of ESRD and comorbid conditions 
      according to the CAC score. However, results of multiple regression analysis showed 
      that only a higher age was significantly associated with the CAC score. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves showed that the sensitivity and specificity of 
      L-spine radiography for diagnosing CAC were 56% and 91%, respectively, for 
      diagnosing CAC (area under the curve, 0.735). DISCUSSION: CAC was frequent in 
      patients with incident dialysis, and multiple regression analysis showed that only 
      age was significantly associated with the CAC score. In addition, L-spine 
      radiography could be a helpful modality for diagnosing CAC in patients with incident 
      dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) often fail to mature, but the mechanism of 
      AVF nonmaturation is poorly understood. Arterial microcalcification is common in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may limit vascular dilatation, 
      thereby contributing to early postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis and 
      impaired AVF maturation. This study evaluated whether preexisting arterial 
      microcalcification adversely affects AVF outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 127 patients with CKD undergoing AVF surgery at a large 
      academic medical center. PREDICTORS: Preexisting arterial microcalcification (≥1% of 
      media area) assessed independently by von Kossa stains of arterial specimens 
      obtained during AVF surgery and by preoperative ultrasound. OUTCOMES: 
      Juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis (ascertained by ultrasound obtained 4-6 weeks 
      postoperatively), AVF nonmaturation (inability to cannulate with 2 needles with 
      dialysis blood flow ≥ 300mL/min for ≥6 sessions in 1 month within 6 months of AVF 
      creation), and duration of primary unassisted AVF survival after successful use 
      (time to first intervention). RESULTS: Arterial microcalcification was present by 
      histologic evaluation in 40% of patients undergoing AVF surgery. The frequency of a 
      postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis was similar in patients with or without 
      preexisting arterial microcalcification (32% vs 42%; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28-1.52; 
      P=0.3). AVF nonmaturation was observed in 29%, 33%, 33%, and 33% of patients 
      with <1%, 1% to 4.9%, 5% to 9.9%, and ≥10% arterial microcalcification, respectively 
      (P=0.9). Sonographic arterial microcalcification was found in 39% of patients and 
      was associated with histologic calcification (P=0.001), but did not predict AVF 
      nonmaturation. Finally, among AVFs that matured, unassisted AVF maturation (time to 
      first intervention) was similar for patients with and without preexisting arterial 
      microcalcification (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21; P=0.2). LIMITATIONS: Single-center 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial microcalcification is common in patients with advanced 
      CKD, but does not explain postoperative AVF stenosis, AVF nonmaturation, or AVF 
      failure after successful cannulation.

      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health concern due to the 
      increased prevalence the high fatalities related to heart disease in this 
      population. Among novel cardiovascular risk markers, the coronary artery 
      calcification score (CAC) emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular 
      events. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to test if glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria 
      are independently associated with coronary calcification. METHODS: The Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health is a cohort of men and women aged 35 to 74 years 
      old addressing cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the association of CAC, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 
      according to stages of eGFR (1 = ≥90; 2 = 60-89; 3 = <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ), and ACR 
      (<30; 30 to 300; >300 mg/g). These associations were estimated by logistic 
      regression with a model including age, sex, race, income, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors. RESULTS: Among 4189 persons (median age = 51 years, 54% women), 1183 had 
      CAC. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in the 
      multivariate model was 0.86 (0.58-1.29) for the category of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2) compared to people with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m(2) . On the other hand, the OR 
      (95% CI) for individuals with ACR >300 mg/g was 4.31 (1.27-14.64) compared to people 
      with ACR <30 mg/g. A discrete interaction factor for the association with CAC 
      between eGFR and ACR were analyzed as continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria 
      was independently associated with coronary calcification, but the reduction of the 
      glomerular filtration rate was not associated with CAC score in this sample of 
      apparently healthy adults.

      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was ascertained using the 
      modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, and was categorized as: ≥90, 
      60 to 89, and <60. CACS was categorized as 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400. 
      Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comprising 
      all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and late revascularization (>90 days). 
      Mean age was 55.8 ± 11.5 years (52.8% male). In total, 261 (2.7%) patients 
      experienced MACE over a median follow-up of 24.5 months (interquartile range: 16.9 
      to 41.1). Incident MACE increased with higher CACS across each eGFR category, with 
      the highest rate observed among patients with CACS >400 and eGFR <60 (95.1 per 1,000 
      person-years). A CACS >400 increased MACE risk with HR 4.46 (95% CI 1.68 to 11.85), 
      6.63 (95% CI 4.03 to 10.92), and 6.14 (95% CI 2.85 to 13.21) for eGFR ≥90, 60 to 89, 
      and <60, respectively, as compared with CACS 0. Further, CACS improved 
      discrimination and reclassification beyond Framingham 10-year risk score (FRS) (AUC: 
      0.70 vs 0.64; category free-NRI: 0.51, all p <0.001) for predicting MACE in patients 
      with impaired renal function (eGFR < 90). In conclusion, CACS improved risk 
      stratification and provided incremental value beyond FRS for predicting MACE, 
      irrespective of eGFR status.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 137-142
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1740-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign of 
      severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. Fetuin-A and 
      osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD therapy. However, 
      there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on dialysis. The aim of 
      our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the relationship between VC and 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and independent predictors of VC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. 
      Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient group was 
      compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A plain 
      radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the evaluation of 
      VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both patients and controls 
      were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients 
      were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly 
      lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly 
      higher in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were 
      independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the following 
      factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was 
      found between patients with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, 
      and 25-OH-vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients 
      undergoing HD and is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the 
      presence of DM, and high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients 
      undergoing HD. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying 
      and the factors contributing to VC.

TI  - Arterial stiffness in dialysis patients: where are we now?
PG  - 741-52
LID - 10.1007/s11255-009-9675-1 [doi]
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease treated by chronic dialysis have an impressive 
      mortality, which more than half of this mortality is attributable to cardiovascular 
      disease. Despite stratification for sex, race, and the presence of diabetes, 
      cardiovascular disease mortality is 10-30 times higher in dialysis patients compared 
      to general population. In dialysis patients, both atherosclerosis (mainly affecting 
      the intima of the arteries) and arteriosclerosis (affecting predominantly the media 
      of large- and middle-sized arteries diffusely) are highly prominent. 
      Arteriosclerosis characterized by reduced arterial compliance (i.e., reduced 
      elasticity of the arteries) is due to increased fibrosis, loss of elastic fibers, 
      and extensive vessel wall calcification. Arteriosclerosis is closely related to 
      arterial stiffness. A generally accepted mechanistic view is that an increase in 
      arterial stiffness causes a premature return of reflected waves in late systole, 
      increasing central pulse pressure, thus systolic. An increased arterial stiffness 
      can increase the risk of stroke through several mechanisms, including an increase in 
      central pulse pressure, influencing arterial remodeling both at the site of the 
      extracranial and intracranial arteries, increasing carotid wall thickness, and the 
      development of stenosis and plaques, and the likelihood of plaque rupture. Very 
      importantly, it was also suggested that arterial stiffness itself independently 
      plays a role in exacerbating chronic kidney disease progression. This review deals 
      briefly with the definition of arterial stiffness, methods of measuring arterial 
      stiffness and pathophysiology of arterial stiffness, and factors related with 
      arterial stiffness.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous 
      pancreas-kidney transplantation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/nep.12212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD 
      artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients 
      undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD. METHODS: Laboratory testing 
      was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) 
      transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral 
      abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale. 
      RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their 
      median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months 
      (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with 
      the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence 
      of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate 
      analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer 
      dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). 
      In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, 
      presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, 
      and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. CONCLUSION: VC 
      is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older 
      patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. 
      However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association 
      of VC to BMD.

AB  - The 2018 and 2019 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology 
      (AHA/ACC) guidelines for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
      disease (ASCVD) recommend consideration of so-called "risk-enhancing factors" in 
      borderline to intermediate risk individuals. These include high-risk race/ethnicity 
      (e.g. South Asian origin), chronic kidney disease, a family history of premature 
      ASCVD, the metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. rheumatoid 
      arthritis [RA], psoriasis, or chronic human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and 
      conditions specific to women, among others. Studies suggest, however, that risk may 
      be highly heterogeneous within these subgroups. The AHA/ACC guidelines also 
      recommend consideration of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring for further risk 
      assessment in borderline to intermediate risk individuals in whom management is 
      uncertain. Although the combination of risk enhancing factors and CAC burden 
      (together with Pooled Cohort estimates) may lead to more accurate ASCVD risk 
      assessment, few publications have closely examined the interplay between risk 
      enhancing factors and CAC scoring for personalized risk estimation. Our aim is to 
      review the relevant literature in this area. Although further research is clearly 
      needed, CAC assessment seems a highly valuable option to inform individualized ASCVD 
      risk management in these important, often highly heterogeneous patient subgroups.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin and sclerostin in chronic kidney disease prior to dialysis: 
      potential partners in vascular calcifications.
PG  - 1345-56
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin and DKK1 constitute opposite bone 
      turnover inhibitors, OPG inhibiting osteoclastogenesis while sclerostin and DKK1 
      exerting their inhibitory effects on osteoblastogenesis. Both proteins have been 
      recognized as strong risk factors of vascular calcifications in non-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      relationships between these inhibitors and coronary artery calcifications (CAC) in 
      this population. METHODS: A total of 241 ND-CKD patients [143 males; 69.0 
      (25.0-95.0) years; median estimated glomerular filtration rate using CKD-EPI 35.1 
      (6.7-120.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All 
      underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. OPG, sclerostin, 
      DKK1 and mineral metabolism markers including PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase were 
      measured. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationships between 
      CAC and these markers. RESULTS: Decline in renal function was associated with a 
      significant increase in OPG and sclerostin while a slight but significant decrease 
      in DKK1 was observed. The main crude associations with presence of CAC were a high 
      level of OPG [OR = 2.55 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (1.35-4.82) for a level 
      ranging from 6.26 to 9.15 pmol/L and OR = 5.74 95% CI (2.87-11.5) for a level ≥9.15 
      pmol/L; P < 0.0001] and a high level of sclerostin [OR = 2.64 95% CI (1.39-5.00) for 
      a level ranging from 0.748 to 1.139 ng/mL and OR = 3.78 95% CI (1.96-7.31) for a 
      level ≥1.139 ng/mL; P = 0.0002]. A logistic regression model clearly showed that the 
      risk to present CAC was significantly increased when both OPG (≥6.26 pmol/L) and 
      sclerostin (≥0.748 ng/mL) levels were high [crude model: OR = 11.47 95% CI 
      (4.54-29.0); P < 0.0001; model adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, body mass index 
      and smoking habits: OR = 5.69 95% CI (1.76-18.4); P = 0.02]. No association between 
      DKK1 and presence of CAC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest 
      that bone turnover inhibitors, OPG and sclerostin, are independently associated with 
      CAC with potential additive effects in ND-CKD patients.

TI  - Abnormalities of vascular histology and collagen fiber configuration in patients 
      with advanced chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 31-40
LID - 10.1177/1129729818773305 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several histologic features have been identified in the 
      upper-extremity arteries and veins of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, 
      which may affect arteriovenous fistula maturation. However, it is unclear whether 
      these chronic kidney disease vascular features are abnormal. METHODS: We obtained 
      upper-extremity arterial and venous specimens from 125 advanced chronic kidney 
      disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula creation and from 15 control 
      subjects. We quantified medial fibrosis, micro-calcification, and intimal 
      hyperplasia with appropriate histology stains. We characterized medial collagen 
      fiber configuration in second-harmonic-generation microscopy images for the fiber 
      anisotropy index and the dominant fiber direction. RESULTS: The advanced chronic 
      kidney disease patients were significantly younger than control subjects 
      (53 ± 14 years vs 76 ± 11 years, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, the chronic 
      kidney disease patients had greater arterial medial fibrosis (69% ± 14% vs 
      51% ± 10%, p < 0.001) and greater arterial micro-calcification (3.03% ± 5.17% vs 
      0.01% ± 0.03%, p = 0.02), but less arterial intimal thickness (30 ± 25 µm vs 
      63 ± 25 µm, p < 0.001), as compared to control subjects. The anisotropy index of 
      medial collagen fibers was lower in both arteries (0.24 ± 0.10 vs 0.44 ± 0.04, 
      p < 0.001) and veins (0.28 ± 0.09 vs 0.53 ± 0.10, p < 0.001) in chronic kidney 
      disease patients, indicating that orientation of the fibers was more disordered. The 
      dominant direction of medial collagen fibers in chronic kidney disease patients was 
      greater in the arteries (49.3° ± 23.6° vs 4.0° ± 2.0°, p < 0.001) and the veins 
      (30.0° ± 19.6° vs 3.9° ± 2.1°, p < 0.001), indicating that the fibers in general 
      were aligned more perpendicular to the lumen. CONCLUSION: Advanced chronic kidney 
      disease is associated with several abnormalities in vascular histology and collagen 
      fiber configuration. Future research is needed to investigate whether these 
      abnormalities affect the maturation outcomes of arteriovenous fistulas.

TI  - Skin autofluorescence associates with vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1784-90
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between tissue advanced 
      glycation end products, as reflected by skin autofluorescence, and vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Three hundred 
      patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease underwent multislice computed 
      tomography to estimate total coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and had tissue 
      advanced glycation end product assessed using a skin autofluorescence reader. Intact 
      parathyroid hormone (P<0.001) displaced estimated glomerular filtration rate as 
      third most significant factor associated with skin autofluorescence after age 
      (P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (P<0.001) in multiple regression analysis. On 
      univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, every 1-U increase in skin 
      autofluorescence was associated with a 7.43-fold (95% confidence intervals, 
      3.59-15.37; P<0.001) increased odds of having CACS ≥400 compared with those with 
      zero CACS. Skin autofluorescence retained significance in predicting CACS ≥400 (odds 
      ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.44-9.18; P=0.006) when adjusting for age, 
      sex, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, C-reactive protein, lipids, blood pressure, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intact parathyroid hormone but marginally 
      lost significance when additionally adjusting for diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 
      2.23; 95% confidence intervals, 0.81-6.14; P=0.1). Combination of diabetes mellitus 
      and higher intact parathyroid hormone was associated with greater skin 
      autofluorescence and CACS versus those without diabetes mellitus and having lower 
      intact parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue advanced glycation end product, as 
      reflected by skin autofluorescence, showed a significant novel association with 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. These data suggest that increased 
      tissue advanced glycation end product may contribute to vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and warrant further experimental 
      investigation.

TI  - Effects of oral activated charcoal on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification 
      in Chinese patients with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 265-272

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between oral activated charcoal (OAC) and 
      hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification is not completely clear. We observed 
      and recorded the effects of OAC on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in 
      stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 
      we included 97 patients with stage 3-4 CKD. In the first phase of the experiment, 
      the patients were randomly divided into the OAC group and placebo group. The 
      endpoint of this phase was the development of hyperphosphatemia. The patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia were selected into the second phase of the study. These patients 
      underwent coronary artery multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and were randomly 
      divided into three groups: the OAC group, the calcium carbonate (CC) group and the 
      lanthanum carbonate (LC) group. RESULTS: The first and second phases of the 
      experiment were followed for 12 months. In the first phase of the experiment, there 
      was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia between the OAC and placebo groups (28.57% vs. 79.17%, 
      X(2) = 24.958, P = 0.000). In the second phase, the differences in coronary 
      calcification score (CACS) between the OAC group, the CC group and the LC group were 
      statistically significant (525.5 ± 104.2 vs 688.1 ± 183.7 vs 431.4 ± 122.5, 
      P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Oral activated charcoal effectively delays the onset of 
      hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. OAC appears to delay the 
      development of vascular calcifications in stage 3-4 CKD patients.

TI  - Serum phosphate levels and mortality risk among people with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 520-8
AB  - Elevated serum phosphate levels have been linked with vascular calcification and 
      mortality among dialysis patients. The relationship between phosphate and mortality 
      has not been explored among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted from eight Veterans Affairs' Medical 
      Centers located in the Pacific Northwest. CKD was defined by two continuously 
      abnormal outpatient serum creatinine measurements at least 6 mo apart between 1999 
      and 2002. Patients who received chronic dialysis, those with a present or previous 
      renal transplant, and those without a recent phosphate measurement were excluded. 
      The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points were acute 
      myocardial infarction and the combined end point of myocardial infarction plus 
      death. A total of 95,619 veterans with at least one primary care or internal 
      medicine clinic contact from a Northwest VA facility and two or more outpatient 
      measurements of serum creatinine, at least 6 mo apart, between January 1, 1999, and 
      December 31, 2002, were identified. From this eligible population, 7021 patients met 
      our definition of CKD. After exclusions, 6730 CKD patients were available for 
      analysis, and 3490 had a serum phosphate measurement during the previous 18 mo. 
      After adjustment, serum phosphate levels >3.5 mg/dl were associated with a 
      significantly increased risk for death. Mortality risk increased linearly with each 
      subsequent 0.5-mg/dl increase in serum phosphate levels. Elevated serum phosphate 
      levels were independently associated with increased mortality risk among this 
      population of patients with CKD.

TI  - Vascular calcifications, arterial aging and arterial remodeling in ESRD.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1159/000345172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated arterial aging and inadequate outward arterial remodeling 
      are observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Whether these changes could 
      be closely associated with arterial calcifications has never been investigated. 
      METHODS: 155 ESRD patients and 105 age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched control 
      subjects were included. Common carotid artery (CCA) pressure, diameter, intima-media 
      thickness, elastic modulus, and presence of calcified plaques were measured 
      ultrasonographically. Carotid artery stiffness was determined from simultaneously 
      recorded CCA diameter and stroke changes in diameter and CCA pressure waveforms, 
      obtained by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, ESRD 
      patients had increased CCA systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.001), larger CCA 
      diameter (p < 0.001) and CCA intima-media thickness (p < 0.01) and similar CCA 
      relative wall thickness. In ESRD patients the arterial remodeling was associated 
      with increased CCA elastic modulus/stiffness (p < 0.001). In ESRD patients the 
      association between CCA elastic modulus and age was characterized by a steeper slope 
      (p = 0.03), but after separation of uremic patients according to the presence of 
      calcifications, the accelerated aging was observed only in calcified subjects. 
      Despite higher CCA systolic and pulse pressures, the CCA relative wall thickness was 
      similar to controls indicating an inadequate pressure-associated remodeling. 
      Moreover, the positive systolic pressure/relative thickness correlation observed in 
      control subjects was lost with paradoxical negative correlation in calcified ESRD 
      patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in ESRD patients, 
      accelerated arterial aging and inadequate arterial hypertrophy are closely 
      associated with the calcifications of arterial walls. Inadequate hypertrophy is 
      responsible for high circumferential stress applied on the vessels.

TI  - Comparison of atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with end 
      stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis to normal controls utilizing (18)F-FDG 
      PET/CT.
PG  - 169-174

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to increased 
      morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The primary underlying 
      mechanism has been suggested as accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Our 
      aim was to compare the atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects 
      with ESRD on hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing 
      fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forthy two subjects who 
      underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively studied. Twenty one were 
      subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis (67±11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 were 
      age- and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) 
      and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, descending, abdominal) and 
      for the common iliac arteries and common femoral arteries were measured. 
      Standardized uptake value maximum and SUVmean for right atrial blood pool were also 
      measured as the background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean, average 
      SUVmax/background ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were compared between 
      subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of macroscopic calcification on 
      CT images for each arterial segment based on visual qualitative assessment was also 
      noted and compared. For statistical analysis, two-sided t-test was used for 
      continuous variables, and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We 
      considered a P value of <0.05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: Average SUVmax 
      and SUVmean were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD than in 
      controls in all arterial segments. Average SUVmax/background ratios were 
      statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal 
      controls in all arterial segments except for the left femoral artery. Average 
      SUVmean/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with 
      ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the right and 
      left femoral arteries. Presence of calcification on CT was more frequently 
      encountered in all arterial segments in subjects with ESRD, and was statistically 
      significantly greater for the aortic arch, descending aorta, and right and left 
      femoral arteries. CONCLUSION: SUV measurements representing the atherosclerotic 
      inflammatory changes and macroscopic atherosclerotic calcifications appear to be 
      accelerated in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to normal controls. 
      Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is a valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying 
      accelerated atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause and mortality in

AB  - Studies on aortic arch calcification (AAC) and mortality risk in maintenance 
      dialysis patients have yielded conflicting findings. We conducted this meta-analysis 
      to investigate the association between the presence of AAC and cardiovascular or 
      all-cause and mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients. Observational studies 
      evaluating baseline AAC and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risk in 
      maintenance dialysis patients were searched through the PubMed and Embase, CNKI, VIP 
      and Wanfang databases until January 2016. A total of 8 studies with 3,256 dialysis 
      patients were identified. Compared with patients without AAC, the presence of AAC 
      was associated with greater risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard risk [HR] 2.30; 
      95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.78-2.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.44; 95% CI 
      1.19-1.75). Subgroup analyses indicated that the pooled HR for cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality was 2.31 (95% CI 1.57-3.40) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.96) for the 
      grade 2/3 AAC. Peritoneal dialysis patients with AAC had greater cardiovascular (HR 
      3.93 vs. HR 2.10) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.36 vs. HR 1.33) than hemodialysis 
      patients. The AAC appears to be independently associated with excessive 
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in maintenance dialysis patients. Regular 
      follow-up AAC might be helpful to stratify mortality risk in dialysis patients.

TI  - Sclerostin Serum Levels and Vascular Calcification Progression in Prevalent Renal 
      Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 4669-76
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-3056 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal 
      transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt 
      signaling contributes to VC. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether 
      circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of 
      VC. DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels 
      Renal Transplant Cohort study. SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care academic 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were 
      measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 
      ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median 
      follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored 
      blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of 
      baseline VC and progression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was 
      progression of VC. RESULTS: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. 
      Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson 
      criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association 
      between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse 
      after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level 
      was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta 
      calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin 
      levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment 
      for traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sclerostin levels inversely 
      associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for 
      traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted 
      chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be 
      up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local 
      counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and 
      experimental data are required for confirmation.

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to 
      exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess 
      characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 
      124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent 
      patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were 
      compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. 
      Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, 
      and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area 
      stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean 
      calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3° 
      vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments 
      (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. 
      There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium 
      >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 
      4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the 
      HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial 
      calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, 
      HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more 
      extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of 
      non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an 
      overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to 
      the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with 
      long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease in children with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 578-85
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2011111115 [doi]
AB  - More than a decade ago, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was recognized as a major cause 
      of death in children with advanced CKD. This observation has sparked the publication 
      of multiple studies assessing cardiovascular risk, mechanisms of disease, and early 
      markers of CVD in this population. Similar to adults, children with CKD have an 
      extremely high prevalence of traditional and uremia-related CVD risk factors. Early 
      markers of cardiomyopathy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, and 
      early markers of atherosclerosis, such as increased carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness, carotid arterial wall stiffness, and coronary artery calcification, are 
      frequently present in these children, especially those on maintenance dialysis. As a 
      population without preexisting symptomatic cardiac disease, children with CKD 
      potentially receive significant benefit from aggressive attempts to prevent and 
      treat CVD. Early CKD, before needing dialysis, is the optimal time to both identify 
      modifiable risk factors and intervene in an effort to avert future CVD. Slowing the 
      progression of CKD, avoiding long-term dialysis and, if possible, conducting 
      preemptive transplantation may represent the best strategies to decrease the risk of 
      premature cardiac disease and death in children with CKD.

TI  - The effectiveness of cinacalcet: a randomized, open label study in chronic 
      hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 326-333
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1562356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high incidences 
      of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study was conducted to 
      demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic kidney 
      disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis patients 
      with severe SHPT. METHODS: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were randomized to 
      cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the achievement of >30% 
      reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated to further explore the 
      effect of cinacalcet on CKD-MBD parameters for 24-week follow up and 12 additional 
      weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation. RESULTS: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH 
      levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 
      (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving 
      iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, 
      p = .001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF-23, 
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid 
      gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24-week follow up and 
      markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD 
      patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF-23, 
      and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can 
      provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially 
      effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an 
      alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - The relationship between poor nutritional status and progression of aortic 
      calcification in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on 
      prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification 
      progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients 
      on HD. METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. 
      Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular 
      blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was 
      evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment 
      ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI 
      values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified 
      into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) 
      and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, 
      comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between 
      ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI 
      progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, 
      respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 
      year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. 
      The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 
      (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic 
      nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were 
      male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the 
      progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to 
      improve progression of aortic calcification in patients on HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of abdominal aortic calcification in healthy living kidney 
      donors.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0485-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common and is both a marker and a cause 
      of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially so in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Renal transplantation is the cornerstone of the successful 
      long-term management of CKD, and in order to satisfy transplantation needs, more use 
      is made now of living kidney donors (LKD). Prior to selection for transplantation, 
      much screening of potential LKD takes place, including for cardiovascular issues. It 
      is not known; however, how much these potentially healthy LKD may be prone to 
      clinically silent VC. METHODS: We identified 103 living kidney donors from 2011 
      renal transplant records. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using 
      existing abdominal CT imaging using multi-channel CT aortograms (used primarily to 
      assess renal vascular anatomy). Using these CT scans, manual calcium scoring was 
      undertaken to calculate total aortic calcium load (AAC severity score). The 
      prevalence, severity and associations of AAC between calcified and non-calcified 
      donors were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 103 donors were identified from 
      records. Ninety three of these had detailed clinical records to complement their CT 
      scans. Fifty of ninety-three donors were male, and the mean age was 45.9 ± 1.8 
      years. Mean MDRD eGFR was 88.73 ± 2.97 ml/min/1.73 m(2). 7.14 ± 3.07 % of the aorta 
      in these donors was calcified with a mean AAC severity score of 0.98 ± 0.56. In 
      kidney donors >50 years of age, there was significantly more AAC than in those <50: 
      2.47 ± 1.56 versus 0.31 ± 0.29, p < 0.001. There was no relationship between the 
      presence or severity of aortic VC and donor GFR, systolic blood pressure, pulse 
      pressure, calcium-phosphate product or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: AAC prevalence, 
      patterns and severity in this important donor population have not previously been 
      described in the literature. There was relatively little VC in what would be 
      regarded as a "healthy" donor population. VC was more common with age, but the other 
      possible risk factors for the presence or severity of VC did not impact on overall 
      AAC scores. VC did not influence vascular stiffness as represented by pulse 
      pressure. Following the evolution of AAC over time in those who have donated a 
      kidney, and lost some global renal function as a consequence, would be of 
      considerable interest.

TI  - Relationships between abdominal aortic calcification, glomerular filtration rate, 
      and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic 
      kidney disease .
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.5414/CN109441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an established risk factor for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized 
      that AAC is associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as 
      with some other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled clinical 
      trial (RENEXC). A total of 151 patients (aged 66 ± 14 years) with an average 
      measured GFR (mGFR) of 22.5 ± 8.2 mL/min/1.73m2, not on renal replacement therapy, 
      irrespective of number of comorbidities, were included. GFR was measured with 
      iohexol clearance and estimated using cystatin C- and creatinine-based equations 
      (eGFR). AAC was evaluated with lateral lumbar X-ray using the scoring system 
      described by Kauppila. All patients underwent laboratory analyses, 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and standard echocardiography. Multiple linear 
      regression analyses controlling for sex, age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and 
      hypertension were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of AAC in this group of 
      patients was 73%, and 47% had severe calcification (AAC score ≥ 7). More men (76%) 
      had AAC than women (69%). AAC score was associated with mGFR (p = 0.03), eGFR (p = 
      0.006), plasma albumin (p = 0.006), plasma phosphate (p = 0.01), pulse pressure (p = 
      0.004), left ventricular mass (LVM) (p = 0.02), left atrial volume (LAV; p < 0.001), 
      and left atrial volume index (LAVI; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: AAC was highly prevalent 
      in CKD. The degree of calcification in the abdominal aorta was strongly associated 
      with a decline in GFR, a decrease in plasma albumin, an increase in plasma 
      phosphate, an increase in pulse pressure, and cardiac structural changes, such as an 
      increase in LVM, LAV, and LAVI. .

AB  - Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The 
      association between carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and chronic kidney disease 
      is controversial, however. In addition, whether renal dysfunction promotes vascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease is not clear. The study 
      subjects were 1003 patients aged ≥50 years who underwent carotid ultrasonography in 
      our hospital. Kidney function was evaluated based on the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Patients with end-stage 
      renal failure were excluded. We measured the mean max-IMT (which indicates mean 
      maximal wall thickness) at 12 carotid segments, and examined the characteristics of 
      the maximal plaques by carotid ultrasonography. We evaluated the association between 
      mean max-IMT and eGFR, and also evaluated the clinical factors associated with mean 
      max-IMT and calcification of the maximal plaques. We found that eGFR was 
      significantly correlated with mean max-IMT. Reduced eGFR, proteinuria, age, male 
      sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking were independently 
      associated with mean max-IMT in multiple regression analysis. Kidney function was 
      not associated with calcified plaque. Kidney dysfunction was associated with carotid 
      atherosclerosis in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease.

PG  - 260-5
LID - S0066-782X2011005000027 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis present an increased risk of cardiovascular 
      death. Intimal media thickness (IMT) and presence of arterial calcifications are 
      well-known risk factors for cardiovascular death in hemodialysis patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of IMT and arterial calcifications in HD 
      patients and to correlate image findings with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study involving 75 patients on dialysis for >12 months. Patients 
      underwent B-mode ultrasound scan (US) for determination of IMT of the distal third 
      of the common carotid arteries. Arterial calcifications were assessed by US of 
      carotids, femoral and tibial arteries, and labeled positive if calcification was 
      found in any arterial site. RESULTS: Patients were 52±13 years old, 57% were males 
      and 16% were diabetics. IMT > 0.9 mm was found in 57% of cases and arterial 
      calcifications at US in 48%. Aging (decades) and smoking were associated with both 
      increased IMT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, p < 0.001; aOR = 4.4, p = 0.045, 
      respectively) and presence of vascular calcifications (aOR = 3.0, p < 0.001; aOR = 
      6.8, p = 0.011, respectively). High intact parathyroid hormone levels (per each 100 
      pg/ml) were significantly associated with increased IMT (aOR = 1.7, p = 0.021), but 
      not with vascular calcification. In contrast, Diabetes and time on dialysis (years) 
      were significant determinants for calcifications at US (aOR = 15.0, p = 0.009; aOR = 
      1.39, p = 0.020), but not for increased IMT. CONCLUSION: Increased IMT and 
      calcifications at US are common findings in hemodialysis patients. Aging and smoking 
      are consistent determinants for both image alterations. Parathyroid hormone 
      elevation is associated with increased IMT. Diabetes and time on dialysis 
      substantially increase the risk for arterial calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vascular calcification can predict cardiovascular (CV) morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the prevalence, 
      association factors, and outcomes of chest X-ray-detected aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We included 190 
      patients undergoing PD (mean age, 52.6 ± 14.3 years) for whom chest radiographs were 
      available. AoAC revealed by chest X-ray was graded from 0 to 3 according to an AoAC 
      score (AoACS). Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the factors 
      associated with AoACS. After adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      mean blood pressure, and history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading 
      and mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard 
      model. RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001), PD duration (p = 0.004), history of CV disease 
      (p < 0.001), and renal Kt/V (p = 0.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean 
      follow-up of 55.1 ± 32.1 months, patients with Grade 2 (p = 0.011) or Grade 3 
      (p < 0.001) AoAC had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In 
      addition, patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than 
      those with Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (p = 0.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.736; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; p = 0.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HR = 3.289; 95% 
      CI, 1.156-9.359; p = 0.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality after 
      adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HR = 36.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; 
      p = 0.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment. CONCLUSION: 
      In patients undergoing PD, CXR-detected severe AoAC was an independent risk factor 
      for all-cause and CV mortalities.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Atherectomy Prior to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A 
      Comparative Assessment of Atherectomy in Patients With Obesity (COAP-PCI 
      Subanalysis).
PG  - 465-470
LID - JIC20181015-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
      atherectomy devices in obese patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC). 
      BACKGROUND: Atherectomy is an important tool for lesion preparation in patients with 
      CAC undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There have been no studies 
      that compared the outcomes of orbital atherectomy (OA) and rotational atherectomy 
      (RA) in obese patients. METHODS: A total of 35,590 patients from five tertiary-care 
      hospitals who underwent PCI between January 2011 to April 2016 were identified. All 
      adult patients with body mass index ≥30 kg/ m2 who had OA or RA prior to PCI were 
      included in this analysis. A total of 91 patients were included in the OA arm and 
      131 patients in the RA arm prior to the matching. To remove potential selection 
      bias, a propensity-score matched analysis was performed, and 69 patients were 
      included in each group. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, composite of safety outcomes, 
      did not occur in any patient of either group. The secondary endpoints - death on 
      discharge (0.0% vs 1.5%; P=.48) and myocardial infarction (2.9% vs 6.4%; P=.42) - 
      were similar between groups, as were individual outcomes including cardiogenic 
      shock, bleeding complications, and congestive heart failure. Stroke, vascular 
      complications, and the requirement for dialysis initiation did not occur in any of 
      the patients. CONCLUSION: In this study assessing atherectomy in obese patients, OA 
      and RA demonstrated comparable outcomes with complication rates within an acceptable 
      range. It demonstrates that OA and RA can be safely performed in this high-risk 
      patient subset with CAC.

PG  - 326-31
LID - 10.1177/1358863X15581448 [doi]
AB  - The cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary calcification have been 
      extensively studied while those related to tibial artery calcium are less well 
      defined. We sought to determine the associations between cardiovascular risk factors 
      and tibial artery calcification in a cohort of patients with and without significant 
      peripheral atherosclerosis. A total of 222 patients without end-stage renal disease 
      were identified in a prospectively maintained database containing tibial artery 
      calcification (TAC) scores, and demographic, cardiovascular, and biochemical risk 
      factor information. Patients with prevalent tibial artery calcification were more 
      likely to be older, male, and have a history positive for hypertension, 
      hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients with an abnormal ankle-brachial 
      index (ABI) or symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were also more likely to 
      have higher calcium values. In analyses using multivariable logistic regression, 
      age, gender, diabetes, and tobacco use maintained their association with prevalent 
      tibial calcification while hypertension, hyperlipidemia and body mass index did not. 
      These associations remained when PAD was added to the model. After adjusting for 
      relevant cardiovascular risk factors, we found that only abnormal ABI, current PAD 
      symptoms, and lower serum calcium values were associated with the presence of tibial 
      artery calcification. In conclusion, in patients without end-stage renal disease, 
      tibial artery calcification has risk factors that are similar but not identical to 
      those for coronary artery calcification and peripheral atherosclerosis.

AB  - Vascular calcium deposition in end-stage renal disease occurs commonly, but its 
      relation to cardiovascular risk factors and fetuin-A levels in African Americans is 
      not known. Compliant African American patients who were undergoing hemodialysis (HD; 
      n = 17) agreed to undergo 64-slice multidetector computed tomography for the 
      assessment of coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The relation between traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age; gender; dialysis vintage; history of 
      diabetes; means of the previous 3 years of weekly predialysis blood pressure values 
      and hemoglobin levels; means of monthly values of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline 
      phosphatase, uric acid; and albumin; and means of quarterly measurements of 
      parathyroid hormone and lipids) and fetuin-A levels and CACS was explored using 
      univariate analyses. Serum phosphorus levels over the previous 3 years were well 
      controlled. The CACS range was 0 to 3,877 Agatston units (mean 996, median 196). 
      Among the tested variables, only fetuin-A was significantly and inversely associated 
      with CACS (standardized beta = -0.64, 95% confidence interval -18.09 to -3.62, p = 
      0.006). There was no association between age and fetuin-A level (standardized beta = 
      -0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.10 to 0.23). In conclusion, African-American 
      patients who were undergoing long-term hemodialysis and with good phosphorus control 
      exhibited a strong inverse correlation between fetuin-A level and CACS that was 
      independent of age.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and associated 
      factors of carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 309 panoramic 
      radiographs of patients with CKD (180 men and 129 women; mean age 43.7 years) 
      undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated by a single radiologist to determine the 
      frequency of CAC. An analysis of associated factors, such as age, sex, time spent in 
      hemodialysis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, biochemical parameters, and 
      other systemic diseases, was also performed. RESULTS: The presence of CAC in 
      patients with CKD, as determined on the basis of panoramic radiography, was 15.9%. 
      The χ(2) test revealed that there was a statistically significant association 
      between certain factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, and the presence 
      of CAC (P < .05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that time spent in hemodialysis 
      was significantly associated with the occurrence of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant 
      presence of CAC was detected on digital panoramic radiographs in patients with CKD 
      undergoing hemodialysis. Calcification was more frequent in older patients, women, 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus, and patients who had undergone hemodialysis for 
      longer periods.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1111/nep.12210 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk 
      factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney 
      transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same 
      time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the 
      long-term. METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC 
      was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting 
      list. RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT 
      and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no 
      differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD 
      between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was 
      observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were 
      associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was 
      more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged 
      dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC 
      increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial 
      after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe 
      degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became 
      more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part 
      influenced by past dialysis experience.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease in the dialysis population: prognostic significance of 
      arterial disorders.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiovascular disease is a major factor in the high mortality of 
      patients with end-stage renal disease, and this population is particularly 
      appropriate to analyse the impact of cardiovascular risk markers on outcome. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Cardiovascular risk markers in end-stage renal disease include age, left 
      ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, blood pressure and aortic 
      stiffness (pulse wave velocity). Aortic pulse wave velocity has been shown to be an 
      independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease and the general population. Aortic pulse wave velocity has the highest 
      sensitivity and specificity as a predictor of cardiovascular death in end-stage 
      renal disease patients. Pulse wave velocity is an integrated index of vascular 
      function and structure, and is a major determinant of systolic hypertension, thereby 
      increasing left ventricular afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy and left 
      ventricular oxygen consumption. Decreased diastolic blood pressure, another 
      consequence of arterial stiffening, is associated with decreased coronary perfusion 
      contributing to ischaemic heart disease and evolution of adaptive into maladaptive 
      left ventricular hypertrophy. SUMMARY: Aortic stiffness measurements could serve as 
      an important tool in identifying end-stage renal disease patients at higher risk of 
      cardiovascular disease. The ability to identify these patients would lead to better 
      risk stratification and earlier and more cost-effective preventive therapy.

TI  - Serum magnesium level and vascular stiffness in children with chronic kidney disease 
      on regular hemodialysis.
PG  - 233-40
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.178205 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this 
      population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple 
      cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, 
      we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness 
      in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children 
      with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children 
      age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured, and Doppler 
      ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the peak systolic 
      velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) 
      arteries were recorded in the study patients. There were significantly lower serum 
      Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the controls (1.7 ± 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 
      ± 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the 
      aorta and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 ± 0.07 mm vs. 
      0.40 ± 0.09 mm; 0.98 ± 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 ± 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, 
      respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding the PSV of 
      the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study patients and the controls 
      (P >0.05). A negative correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT 
      (AIMT) (r = -0.682; P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was 
      found between the AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 
      0.025, 0.472, P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were 
      associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our 
      results warrants further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic calcification is 
      more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of adverse cardiovascular 
      outcome. The aim of the present study was to characterize aortic calcification in 
      renal compared with non-renal patients. METHODS: Aortas of 31 patients with advanced 
      CKD and of 31 age-and gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. Calcium and 
      phosphorus content in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis. The expression 
      of calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting proteins was assessed using 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The calcium and phosphorus content of the aorta was 
      higher in CKD patients than in controls. Even in non-calcified aortic specimens of 
      CKD, staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine was 
      significantly more marked compared to controls. The same proteins were 
      immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens of both CKD and controls. In contrast, 
      staining for transglutaminase-2 and Fetuin A was significantly reduced in CKD. 
      Higher expression of cbfa-1 and Pit-1 was observed in all calcified aortas with no 
      difference between CKD and controls. The expression of TNF-alpha, phospho-p38 and 
      Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of upregulation of BMP-2 and osteoblastic 
      transdifferentiation by VSMC even in non-calcified areas of the aortas of CKD. 
      CONCLUSION: The expression of markers characteristic for calcification is not 
      different in calcified aorta of CKD patients compared to controls, but in CKD 
      patients, evidence of inflammation, transformation to an osteoblastic phenotype and 
      reduced expression of transglutaminase are also found even in non-calcified aorta.

TI  - Pre-existing Arterial Micro-Calcification Predicts Primary Unassisted Arteriovenous 
      Fistula Failure in Incident Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 665-9
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12365 [doi]
AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access 
      patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of arterial 
      micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD patients. 
      One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operation 
      were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial arterial 
      specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to identify AMiC. 
      We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between positive and 
      negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for evaluating risk 
      factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF failure occurred in 
      45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was greater in the positive 
      AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group had a lower AVF patency 
      rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The presence of AMiC was an 
      independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion, preexisting AMiC of the 
      vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF failure in incident HD 
      patients.

TI  - Surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in patients 
      with renal dysfunction and/or aortic arch calcification.
PG  - 444-447
AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors recently reported that the presence of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and/or extended abdominal aortic calcification was associated with 
      significantly worse clinical outcomes after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. CKD 
      is one of the highest risk factors for systemic atherosclerosis. Therefore, impaired 
      blood flow due to atherosclerosis could exacerbate degeneration of the cervical 
      spine and neural tissue. However, there has been no report of a study evaluating the 
      deleterious effects of CKD and atherosclerosis on the outcomes after decompression 
      surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. The purpose of this study was thus to 
      examine whether CKD and systemic atherosclerosis affect surgical outcomes after 
      laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). METHODS The authors analyzed 
      data from 127 consecutive cases involving patients who underwent laminoplasty for 
      CSM and met their inclusion criteria. Stage 3-4 CKD was present as a preoperative 
      comorbidity in 44 cases. Clinical status was assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic 
      Association (JOA) cervical myelopathy evaluation questionnaire before surgery and 2 
      years postoperatively. As a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, the presence of 
      aortic arch calcification (AoAC) was assessed on preoperative chest radiographs. 
      RESULTS AoAC was found on preoperative chest radiographs in 40 of 127 patients. 
      Neither CKD nor AoAC had a statistically significant deleterious effect on 
      preoperative JOA score. However, CKD and AoAC were significantly associated with 
      reductions in both the JOA score recovery rate (mean 36.1% in patients with CKD vs 
      44.7% in those without CKD; 26.0% in patients with AoAC vs 48.9% in those without 
      AoAC) and the change in JOA score at 2 years after surgery (mean 2.3 points in 
      patients with CKD vs 3.1 points in those without CKD; 2.1 points for patients with 
      AoAC vs 3.2 points for those without AoAC). A multivariate regression analysis 
      showed that AoAC was a significant independent predictor of poor outcome with 
      respect to both for the difference between follow-up and preoperative JOA scores and 
      the JOA score recovery rate. CONCLUSIONS CKD and AoAC were associated with increased 
      rates of poor neurological outcomes after laminoplasty for CSM, and AoAC was a 
      significant independent predictive factor for poor outcome.

TI  - Radial artery sclerostin expression in chronic kidney disease stage 5 predialysis 
      patients: a cross-sectional observational study.
PG  - 1433-1437
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1604-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel 
      candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. The 
      aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression and 
      its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December 
      2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous 
      fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were collected 
      and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical 
      staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were 
      measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries was 56.25%. Sclerostin 
      expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum sclerostin levels in 
      patients with positive sclerostin expression were much higher than in those with 
      negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including 
      potential confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, 
      serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline 
      phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      showed that only serum sclerostin levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin 
      expression (p = 0.025). The area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for 
      predicting positive vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity 
      and 85.7% specificity (p  = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin 
      expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Positive expression 
      of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was related to high serum sclerostin 
      levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local and systemic regulator involved in 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 658-67
LID - 10.1159/000368476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple 
      assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted a prospective 
      study to investigate factors associated with the presence at baseline and 
      progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a 
      short-term outcome. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 
      asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 
      2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and 
      biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years. 
      RESULTS: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients 
      (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An 
      increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male patients 
      who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years, 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
      calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients 
      with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and the grade of 
      AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates were 
      significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were 
      independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by chest 
      X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are representative 
      markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical 
      outcomes remain undetermined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 523 patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been examined with fundus photography 
      for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple radiographs were analyzed for the 
      presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC of the abdominal aorta and 
      iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was evaluated in terms of the rate of 
      renal function decline and composite of any cardiovascular event or death. CKD 
      patients with retinopathy showed higher prevalence of apVC than those without 
      retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001).The presence of retinopathy was 
      independently associated with apVC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate 
      analysis, compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence 
      of both apVC and retinopathy were independently associated with rapid renal function 
      decline (β = -1.51; 95% CI -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were 
      not. Compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite 
      end points were 1.05 (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 
      1.17, 3.67) for patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with 
      both apVC and retinopathy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of VC and 
      retinopathy was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular 
      events or deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.

      prediction of disease outcomes in women.
PG  - 425-35
LID - 10.1586/erc.13.26 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality globally. In absolute 
      numbers, more women die from CVD than men do. CVD mortality risk differs between 
      genders, reflecting the different distribution of modifiable risk factors and 
      severity of CVD outcomes. This study reviews six established risk score models and 
      their applicability to the female population. These models are assessed against two 
      criteria: discrimination and calibration. Sensitivity, specificity and positive- and 
      negative-predictive values are also examined. The risk score models are found to be 
      limited in applicability, requiring recalibration beyond their study population. 
      Relevant risk factors to predict CVD mortality for women, such as measures of 
      obesity, physical activity, alcohol consumption, use of antihypertensive medication, 
      chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcium are generally not incorporated in 
      these models.

PG  - 3123-5
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.05.123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors in patients 
      undergoing dialysis therapy or transplantation is associated with a 3.5- to 50-fold 
      higher risk than in the general population. The primary cause of death in transplant 
      recipients is cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To report echocardiographic 
      findings using a screening protocol to detect heart disease in candidates for kidney 
      transplantation. METHODS: Between November 2005 and December 2009, we examined 356 
      patients using 2-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: A high 
      prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, 
      valvulopathy, and valve calcification was observed. There was a positive correlation 
      between valve calcification and female sex, age (P<.001), duration of renal 
      replacement therapy (P=.01), peripheral arterial disease (P=.02), cerebrovascular 
      disease (P=.005), and high concentration of lipoprotein(a) (P=.02). CONCLUSION: An 
      echocardiographic study should be part of the initial evaluation in candidates for 
      renal transplantation.

LID - 82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis 
      patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of 
      these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy 
      studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we 
      hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be 
      predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. METHODS: All 
      patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI 
      with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent 
      CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified 
      using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC 
      and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients 
      were included in this study (71% male, 67 ± 7 years old). Forty-six patients were 
      found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with 
      CAD (10.1 ± 4.9 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed 
      that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold 
      higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% 
      and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is 
      predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic 
      dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could 
      contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of 
      CAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ; ISRCTN20479861 , registered

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular (CV) events in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness, also 
      predicts CV events in RTR. The study investigated the relationship between CAC and 
      PWV in RTR and assessed the performance of PWV measurement in predicting CAC. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: The study was performed as cross-sectional analysis in 104 RTR. 
      CAC was determined as total calcium score (CS) and calcium mass (CM). 
      Carotid-femoral PWV was also measured. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to assess the performance of PWV as 
      diagnostic test for presence of CAC. RESULTS: CAC was found in 69% of participants. 
      PWV was higher in RTR with CAC than in RTR without CAC (10.2±2.2 vs. 8.6±15; 
      p<0.001). In univariate analysis CS was significantly correlated with age, duration 
      of hypertension, waist circumference, PWV, hemoglobin concentration, and serum 
      glucose. In multiple linear regression analysis CS was independently associated with 
      age only, but not with PWV. Sensitivity and specificity of PWV>7.6m/s as cut-off for 
      detecting CAC>0 was 0.889 and 0.406, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      PWV>10.2m/s as cut-off for detecting severe CAC (CS>400) was 0.319 and 0.969, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed high prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification in renal transplant recipients. The study does not support the 
      hypothesis that aortic stiffness is independently associated with coronary artery 
      calcification in RTR. PWV measurement may be useful in excluding severe CAC in RTR.

TI  - Calcification in arteriovenous fistula blood vessels may predict arteriovenous 
      fistula failure: a 5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 881-887
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1515-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for 
      hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains 
      unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the 
      light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification 
      process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the 
      calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity. METHODS: The 
      study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a 
      mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent 
      primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic 
      region was detected using X-ray examination. RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood 
      vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis 
      demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of 
      AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of 
      AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these 
      standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels 
      calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 
      (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications of 
      AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize 
      the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method 
      for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be 
      monitored more closely.

TI  - Two years of maintenance hemodialysis has a pronounced effect on arterial stiffness 
      progression.
PG  - 193-199
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-0971-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The change of aortic stiffness, but not the particular baseline value, 
      plays a crucial role in estimating the patient risk with end-stage renal disease. 
      Therefore, we aimed to analyze the evolution of central and peripheral arterial 
      stiffness in hemodialysis population without previous cardiovascular events during a 
      2-year follow-up. METHODS: 60 hemodialysis patients (mean age 57.61 ± 13.01 years) 
      were prospectively interviewed, and they underwent blood tests, chest X-ray for 
      aortic calcification evaluation and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements at the 
      baseline, after 6 months and after 2 years of observation period. RESULTS: We found 
      significant progression of aortic PWV (12.73 vs. 14.24 m/s, p = 0.032) and 
      regression of brachial PWV (11.53 vs. 8.85 m/s, p < 0.001). CRP increase influenced 
      evolution of aortic PWV (β = 0.331, p = 0.031, R(2) = 0.599). Higher 
      β2-microglobulin values was related to the progression of aortic PWV (β = 0.219, 
      p = 0.022, R(2) = 0.568). Mean arterial blood pressure had influence only on the 
      short-term arterial stiffness evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis experience pronounced changes of arterial stiffness during the 2-year 
      follow-up period. The progression of aortic stiffness is related to inflammatory 
      response and particularly is influenced by β2-microglobulin concentration and aortic 
      calcification.

PG  - 33164

LID - 33164
AB  - Peripheral artery occlusive disease and vascular calcification are highly prevalent 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients, however the association of the combination of 
      ankle-brachial index (ABI) and aortic arch calcification (AoAC) with clinical 
      outcomes in patients undergoing HD is unknown. In this study, we investigated 
      whether the combination of ABI and AoAC is independently associated with overall and 
      cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. The median follow-up period was 5.7 years. 
      Calcification of the aortic arch was assessed by chest X-ray. Forty-seven patients 
      died including 24 due to cardiovascular causes during the follow-up period. The 
      study patients were stratified into four groups according to an ABI < 0.95 or ≥0.95 
      and an AoAC score of >4 or ≤4 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. 
      Those with an ABI < 0.95 and AoAC > 4 (vs. ABI ≥ 0.95 and AoAC score ≤ 4) were 
      associated with overall (hazard ratio [HR], 4.913; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.932 to 12.497; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular (HR, 3.531; 95% CI, 1.070 to 11.652; 
      p = 0.038) mortality in multivariable analysis. The combination of a low ABI and 
      increased AoAC was associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in 
      patients undergoing HD.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of cardiovascular calcium in chronic kidney disease (from 
      the Prospective Longitudinal RRI-CKD Study).
PG  - 571-6
AB  - Although the determinants of cardiovascular calcium have been well described in 
      dialysis patients, the prevalence and predictors in predialysis chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) are less known. One hundred six patients with CKD from the Renal 
      Research Institute-CKD Study underwent multidetector computed tomography for the 
      assessment of calcium deposition at the level of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, 
      aortic valve, and mitral valve. Cardiovascular risk factors and renal 
      function-related parameters (glomerular filtration rate, glomerular filtration rate 
      slope, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, albumin, calcium, 
      phosphate, and parathyroid hormone) were included in multivariate regression models 
      to predict cardiovascular calcium. Prevalences of calcium deposition at the level of 
      coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve were 69%, 46%, 
      39%, and 16%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, coronary artery calcium score 
      was predicted by age (p < 0.0001), gender (p = 0.0001), diabetes (p = 0.024), and 
      history of coronary artery disease (p = 0.016), but not by renal function related 
      parameters. Similarly, renal function related parameters were not predictive of 
      aortic or valvular calcium. In conclusion, predialysis CKD is associated with a high 
      prevalence of cardiovascular calcium. The extent of cardiovascular calcium in 
      patients with predialysis CKD is related to some of the traditional risk factors for 
      atherosclerosis but not to indexes of abnormal renal function or progression in 
      renal dysfunction.

TI  - Wishful Thinking: The Surprisingly Sparse Evidence for a Relationship between 
      Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Disease in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 224-30
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12345 [doi]
AB  - The increased frequency of cardiovascular disease observed in hemodialysis patients 
      is secondary to the combination of many traditional (age, male sex, hypertension, 
      smoking, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia) and novel and uremia-related 
      (inflammation, uremic toxins, adipokine imbalance, coagulation disorders, 
      protein-energy wasting, volume overload, endothelial dysfunction, 
      hyperparathyroidism, and subclinical hypothyroidism) risk factors. Usually, in the 
      latter group, oxidative stress is included. However, after decades of research, it 
      remains essentially unknown if oxidative stress has a causative role in the 
      development of cardiovascular disease in long-term hemodialysis patients because 
      adequate longitudinal studies are lacking. Data deriving from cross-sectional 
      studies suggest that biomarkers of oxidative stress are associated with 
      cardiovascular disease prevalence. Conversely, conflicting and inconclusive results 
      have been obtained on the association between oxidative stress and coronary artery 
      calcification, atherosclerosis, and all-cause and cardiovascular disease-related 
      outcome. It is desirable that further studies are conducted on this topic in the 
      near future.

TI  - The impact of coronary calcification on angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes of 
      everolimus-eluting stents: results of a XIENCE V/PROMUS post-marketing surveillance 
      study.
PG  - 313-320

AB  - Coronary calcification (CCA) is one of the independent predictors for major adverse 
      cardiac events (MACEs) in coronary intervention. Post-marketing surveillance study 
      Japan is a prospective registry designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 
      everolimus-eluting stent (EES, XIENCE V/PROMUS Stent) in routine clinical practice 
      at 47 centers. In this study, 1848 lesions (1546 patients) were assessed using 
      quantitative coronary angiography. In these 1546 patients, renal function data were 
      unknown in 26 patients. Three patients in 70 patients with dialysis and 56 patients 
      in 1450 patients with no dialysis were excluded, because they had multiple lesions 
      with mixed calcification lesions. We evaluated the effects of CCA on 8-month 
      angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes in dialysis and non-dialysis patients. 
      Moderate-to-severe (Ca group) and none-to-mild CCA (non-Ca group) were observed in 
      33 lesions (30 patients) and 48 lesions (37 patients) in dialysis patients, and 
      these were observed in 306 lesions (286 patients) and 1303 lesions (1108 patients) 
      in non-dialysis patients, respectively. In non-dialysis patients, the 
      ischemic-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR) and MACE rate over the 
      3 years were significantly higher in the Ca group than in the non-Ca group (5.8 vs. 
      3.1%, p = 0.025 and 10.0 vs. 5.0%, p = 0.0011). In dialysis patients, ID-TLR and 
      MACE rates were high in both groups (14.3 vs. 17.9%, p = 0.85 and 17.5 vs. 36.1%, 
      p = 0.16). In non-dialysis patients, 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical 
      outcomes were worse in the Ca group. However, in dialysis patients, both outcomes 
      were worse regardless of CCA.Clinical Trial registration

TI  - FGF-23 levels are associated with vascular calcification, but not with 
      atherosclerosis, in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 609-17
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1231-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim 
      of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma 
      FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent 
      coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution color Doppler 
      ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs 
      was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 
      400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, 
      and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level 
      was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 
      0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence 
      of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal 
      regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs 
      together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model 
      r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in 
      patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the 
      prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with 
      carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

LID - 10.1159/000334597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis 
      patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT 
      interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to 
      elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval 
      duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We performed a 
      single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. 
      Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. 
      Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays. RESULTS: In the final 
      analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT 
      interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an 
      independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of 
      aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular 
      history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged 
      QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is 
      associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

TI  - Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1758-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard for 
      evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less 
      costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries 
      has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome 
      predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in 
      predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance 
      hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. METHODS: Four 
      hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic 
      radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the 
      methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were 
      followed prospectively for 5 years. RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with 
      the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT 
      (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher 
      prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and 
      eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, 
      whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function 
      and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 
      as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, 
      whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all 
      three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, 
      whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. 
      Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, 
      serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but 
      not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients. CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting 
      mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.

LID - 10.1159/000362862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in the 
      general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI on 
      CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease not on 
      dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis initiation, 
      and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. METHODS: CKD patients were 
      divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of dialysis, and 
      extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and multivariable analysis 
      were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD 
      stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, 
      albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour 
      proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 
      years. RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 
      0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not increase 
      the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or 
      multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not 
      increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 
      0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 
      0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to 
      other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 
      95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of 
      CAC extent or progression. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High 
      BMI increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to 
      CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact 
      of high BMI on dialysis initiation.

TI  - Impact of vascular calcifications on arteriovenous fistula survival in hemodialysis 
      patients: a five-year follow-up.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1159/000380823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis 
      patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The aim 
      of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications may have 
      on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival. METHODS: This study included 90 
      patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular calcification scores 
      ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access calcification score); patients 
      were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and 
      severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 
      5 years after calcification measurement or until the patient's 
      death/transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with more pronounced vascular 
      calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed a significant relationship between calcification score and male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and 
      intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal 
      differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification 
      scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 
      3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 
      (CI 0.97-22.38). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse 
      survival of native arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.

PG  - 799-805

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if significant differences in plaque 
      composition exist between the popliteal and tibial vessels in patients with severe 
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Forty-four patients with PAD required either 
      above-knee (n = 38), below-knee (n = 5), or through-knee (n = 1) amputation for 
      pedal sepsis/gangrene. The 51 vessels (anterior tibial, n = 9; posterior tibial, n = 
      10; peroneal, n = 3; popliteal, n = 29) were obtained and underwent intravascular 
      ultrasound (IVUS) evaluation ex vivo within 24 hr of amputation. Sequential IVUS 
      data were obtained at known intervals throughout the vessel length and then analyzed 
      with radiofrequency techniques for quantification of plaque composition, plaque 
      volume, and total vessel volume. Plaque composition was categorized as fibrous, 
      fibro-fatty, necrotic core, and dense calcium. Clinical data were obtained via 
      review of electronic records at the time of amputation. Two-sided t-tests were 
      performed to compare components within each plaque. Results are expressed as mean 
      percentage +/- standard error of the mean. Tibial vessels had more dense calcium 
      within these plaques than popliteal arteries (33.8 +/- 5.6% vs. 10.6 +/- 1.9%, p < 
      0.001). Consequently, distal vessels had less fibro-fatty and fibrous plaque than 
      popliteal arteries (7.7 +/- 1.4% vs. 13.1 +/- 1.2%, p < 0.005; 42.4 +/- 4.7% vs. 
      61.4 +/- 2.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). Necrotic core plaque composition was found 
      to be similar when comparing tibial versus popliteal arteries (16.1% vs. 14.9%, p = 
      nonsignificant). Clinical factors including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic 
      renal insufficiency were not associated with plaque composition differences using a 
      univariate analysis. As we progress distally in the arterial tree of patients with 
      PAD, calcium plaque content increases with decreasing burden of fibro-fatty plaque. 
      Clinical and demographic factors, with the exception of smoking, were not found to 
      be associated with atherosclerotic plaque composition.

TI  - Arterial microcalcification in atherosclerotic patients with and without chronic 
      kidney disease: a comparative high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction analysis.
PG  - 465-72
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9594-5 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, albeit heterogeneous in terms of biological and 
      physicochemical properties, has been associated with ageing, lifestyle, diabetes, 
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unknown whether or not moderately impaired 
      renal function (CKD stages 2-4) affects the physiochemical composition and/or the 
      formation of magnesium-containing tricalcium phosphate ([Ca,Mg](3)[PO(4)](2), 
      whitlockite) in arterial microcalcification. Therefore, a high-resolution scanning 
      X-ray diffraction analysis (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, 
      France) utilizing histological sections of paraffin-embedded arterial specimens 
      derived from atherosclerotic patients with normal renal function (n = 15) and CKD 
      (stages 2-4, n = 13) was performed. This approach allowed us to spatially assess the 
      contribution of calcium phosphate (apatite) and whitlockite to arterial 
      microcalcification. Per group, the number of samples (13 vs. 12) with sufficient 
      signal intensity and total lengths of regions (201 vs. 232 μm) giving rise to 
      diffractograms ("informative regions") were comparable. Summarizing all informative 
      regions per group into one composite sample revealed calcium phosphate/apatite as 
      the leading mineral phase in CKD patients, whereas in patients with normal renal 
      function the relative contribution of whitlockite and calcium phosphate/apatite was 
      on the same order of magnitude (CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 157 μm, whitlockite 
      38.7 μm; non-CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 79.0 μm, whitlockite 94.1 μm; each p < 
      0.05). Our results, although based on a limited number of samples, indicate that 
      chronic impairment of renal function affects local magnesium homeostasis and thus 
      contributes to the physicochemical composition of microcalcification in 
      atherosclerotic patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) predicts cardiovascular events in the 
      general population. We conducted a prospective study to determine if inflammatory 
      markers were predictive of CAC and if CAC predicted cardiovascular events and 
      mortality in incident renal transplant recipients. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 
      112 asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients who had no prior history of 
      coronary artery revascularization or myocardial infarction had coronary 
      calcifications measured early post-transplant and at least 18 months later by 
      Agatston score and volume method. RESULTS: The mean CAC score was 367.7 (682.3). 
      Inflammatory markers such as WBC and CRP were predictive of CAC severity. Recipients 
      with cardiovascular events (n=11) or death (n=12) during the follow-up period had 
      higher mean [675.1 (669.3) vs. 296.8 (669.0), p=0.02] and median [434.8 vs. 28.9, 
      p=0.01] CAC score compared to those without them. Recipients with CAC score less 
      than 100 had a better cumulative survival rate compared to the recipients with CAC 
      score greater than 100 [95.1% vs. 82.3%, p=0.03]. We found a significant unadjusted 
      and adjusted association between CAC score and cardiovascular events and mortality. 
      A quarter (25.9%) of recipients had CAC progression. Coronary calcification 
      progression also predicted cardiovascular events and mortality after adjustment for 
      diabetes and dialysis vintage. CONCLUSION: CAC is prevalent in renal recipients and 
      is predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality. Coronary calcification 
      progression is common and predict clinical outcomes. Inflammatory markers are 
      predictive of CAC severity at time of transplant, but are not predictive of future 
      cardiovascular event or mortality.

TI  - Application of a Novel CT-Based Iliac Artery Calcification Scoring System for 
      Predicting Renal Transplant Outcomes.
PG  - 436-41
LID - 10.2214/AJR.15.14794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and 
      distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium 
      scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT of 
      the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56 women 
      with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate semiquantitative 
      score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and morphology for the 
      common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The operative and 
      clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial segment was used for 
      anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether delayed graft function 
      (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using 
      the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for 
      each calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly 
      higher average calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all 
      categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of 
      higher scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, 
      hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the 
      calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was 
      independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of 
      the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT 
      evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival after 
      transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis 
      was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine 
      pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with 
      diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to 
      optimize outcomes.

      disease: a computed tomographic study.
PG  - 501-8
LID - 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283639eb3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, 
      atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 
      non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic 
      angiography. METHODS: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary 
      atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD 
      patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD controls 
      (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging 
      software. RESULTS: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques 
      (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium 
      content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score 
      correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non-ESRD, P<0.001 
      for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and 
      atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 
      vs. 0.804; P=0.574). CONCLUSION: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and 
      calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score 
      and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals suffer from accelerated aging, which manifests as premature 
      cardiovascular and bone disease. However, little is known of the association of 
      these two disorders in the HIV population. Our objective was to investigate the 
      association between a marker of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium [CAC]) and 
      low bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional cohort of HIV-infected patients. 
      The study was conducted at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. A 
      total of 636 consecutive middle-aged, HIV-infected subjects were recruited between 
      January 2006 and December 2010. All patients underwent CAC and BMD assessment. 
      Patients were categorized according to a CAC score <100 or >100 units based on 
      previous literature that identified this cut-point as a marker of increased risk. 
      Low femoral and lumbar spine BMD was defined as <25th percentile value for the study 
      cohort. Logistic regression and bootstrap analysis were used to assess the 
      independent association between CAC and BMD. The main outcome measure was a CAC 
      score >100. Patients with CAC > 100 were older and more likely to be men, diabetic, 
      and overweight. Patients with CAC < 100 had better renal function and a lower 
      cardiovascular risk profile. After adjusting for age, sex, traditional and 
      HIV-specific risk factors, vitamin D level, and PTH level, there was a significant 
      association between CAC > 100 and low BMD for the femur (OR = 2.33, 95 % CI 
      1.09-4.99; p = 0.02) but not for the spine. Bootstrap analyses confirmed these 
      findings. In summary, CAC was independently associated with low femoral BMD in 
      HIV-infected patients. Future studies should test whether therapies that attenuate 
      cardiovascular risk in HIV favorably impact bone health.

TI  - Aberrant activation of Wnt pathways in arteries associates with vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to increased cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of vascular calcification in CKD patients 
      remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical association between 
      abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification in ESRD patients. 
      METHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples of 
      radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous fistula surgery. Expression of 
      Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association 
      between Wnt activities and vascular calcification rates. RESULTS: 
      Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that increased expressions of β-catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed in the subjects with vascular 
      calcification. Further correlation analysis identified that β-catenin expression in 
      overall arterial samples was significantly associated with the expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also found significant correlation between expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis demonstrated that Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular 
      calcification in patients with ESRD. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased 
      activation of Wnt pathways in the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is 
      significantly correlated with the incidence of vascular calcification. These 
      findings support Wnt pathways as a potential target for future therapy of vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

TI  - Pulse wave velocity and vascular calcification at different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 163-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased arterial stiffness and vascular calcification have been 
      recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease. METHOD: In order to examine the precise temporal link 
      between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular risk at the earliest stages of chronic 
      kidney disease, we studied a cohort of 150 patients with chronic kidney disease (52 
      stage 2/3 patients, 51 stage 4/5 patients and 47 stage 5D patients). Each patient 
      underwent a plain, lateral lumbar radiograph and an abdominal and thoracic 
      multislice spiral computer tomography scan in order to identify and quantify aortic 
      and coronary calcifications. Pulse wave velocity was used as a measure of arterial 
      stiffness. RESULTS: Regardless of the disease stage, patients with chronic kidney 
      disease had higher adjusted pulse wave velocity than controls with preserved renal 
      function (14.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 m/s, respectively; P < 0.0001). Regarding 
      aortic calcification, there was a gradual but significant rise in later chronic 
      kidney disease stages. A similar trend was found for coronary calcification. In a 
      multivariate analysis only age, mean arterial pressure, diabetes and the aortic 
      calcification score were independent determinants of higher pulse wave velocity. 
      CONCLUSION: We found that both vascular stiffness and vascular calcification appear 
      early in patients with chronic kidney disease, but only vascular calcification 
      worsens as the disease progresses. The increase of vascular stiffness in adult 
      patients with chronic kidney disease seems to be more related to age, systolic blood 
      pressure, diabetes and vascular calcification than to uremic toxicity.

TI  - Arterial media calcification in end-stage renal disease: impact on all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality.
PG  - 1731-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional and follow-up studies on end-stage renal disease 
      patients showed that arterial calcifications are associated with cardiovascular (CV) 
      morbidity and are an independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality. However, 
      these studies did not examine the impact on prognosis according to the type of 
      calcification, i.e. intimal vs medial. Arterial media calcification (AMC), a 
      non-occlusive condition, affects haemodynamics differently from arterial intima 
      calcification (AIC), which occurs in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the prognostic value of AMC in relationship to all-cause or CV 
      mortality for stable haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We included 202 such 
      patients in the present study. At baseline, soft-tissue native radiograms of the 
      pelvis and the thigh were analysed for the presence and type (AMC vs AIC) of 
      arterial calcifications. All patients underwent B-mode ultrasonography of the common 
      carotid artery to determine the presence of atherosclerotic calcified plaques, 
      measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and echocardiography. RESULTS: AIC was 
      usually observed in older patients with a clinical history of atherosclerosis before 
      starting HD treatment and typical risk factors associated with atherosclerotic 
      disease. AMC was observed in young and middle-aged patients without conventional 
      atherosclerotic risk factors. AMC was closely associated with the duration of HD and 
      calcium-phosphate disorders, including the oral dose of elemental calcium prescribed 
      as phosphate binder (CaCO(3)). Compared to patients with AIC, patients with AMC had 
      a longer survival, but in turn their survival was significantly shorter than that of 
      patients without calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: AMC is a strong prognostic marker of 
      all-cause and CV mortality in HD patients, independently of classical atherogenic 
      factors. The principal effect of AMC on arterial function is increased arterial 
      stiffness.

TI  - Integration of clinical and imaging data to predict death in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 12-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2012.00709.x [doi]
AB  - In a prior publication, we demonstrated that a model integrating clinical and simple 
      imaging data predicted the presence and severity of coronary artery calcification in 
      prevalent hemodialysis patients. Herein we report the ability of the same model to 
      predict all-cause death. We assessed all-cause mortality in 141 consecutive 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients from two dialysis centers followed for a median of 
      79 months from enrollment. Patients were risk stratified according to a simple 
      cardiovascular calcification index (CCI) that included patient's age, dialysis 
      vintage, calcification of the cardiac valves, and abdominal aorta. The mean 
      patients' age was 55 ± 14 years. Abdominal aorta calcification was present in 57% of 
      the patients, and 44% and 38% had aortic and mitral valve calcification, 
      respectively. During follow-up, 75 deaths (93 deaths per 1000 person-years) were 
      recorded. The CCI was linearly associated with risk of death, such that the 
      unadjusted hazard risk (HR) increased by 12% for each point increase in CCI (P < 
      0.001). Further adjustments for age, sex, study center, diabetes mellitus, history 
      of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular 
      hypertrophy, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure did not substantially change the 
      strength of this association (HR 1.10; 95%CI: 1.00-1.21; P = 0.03). The CCI is a 
      simple clinical model that can be used to risk stratify maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - A Nationally Representative Study of Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy Risk Factors.
PG  - 3421-3429
AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is 
      necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated 
      whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would identify patients 
      at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using data from a large 
      dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) 
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race 
      in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients 
      and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively; 67% of participants were women and 
      49% were white. Median duration between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA 
      development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; 
      higher levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and 
      nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with 
      increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes 
      receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a 
      dose-response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh 
      areas (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for more 
      than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between 
      recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years 
      before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of preventive 
      strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Determinants of coronary artery calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1007/s10047-015-0823-3 [doi]
AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called 
      novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to 
      identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by 
      MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, 
      presence of ≥100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate, geriatric 
      nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3, cinacalcet, phosphate 
      binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation parameters including creatinine, 
      albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 MHD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcifications were observed in 192 patients (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS 
      showed direct associations with age (p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and 
      presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), and an inverse association only with 
      active vitamin D3 administration (p < 0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active 
      vitamin D3 showed significantly lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 ± 1635.0 
      vs. 2475.6 ± 2646.6 H, p < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and 
      diabetes mellitus are risk factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is 
      protective factor for coronary artery calcification in MHD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease, 
      the major cause of death in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Longitudinal 
      studies of vascular calcification in KTRs are few and small and have short 
      follow-up. We assessed the evolution of coronary artery (CAC) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification and their determinants in a cohort of prevalent KTRs. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Longitudinal. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The Agatston score of coronary arteries and 
      thoracic aorta was measured by 16-slice spiral computed tomography in 281 KTRs. 
      PREDICTORS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were recorded 
      simultaneously. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The Agatston score was measured again 3.5 
      or more years later. RESULTS: Repeated analyzable computed tomographic scans were 
      available for 197 (70%) KTRs after 4.40 ± 0.28 years; they were not available for 
      the rest of patients because of death (n = 40), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), other 
      arrhythmias (n = 4), refusal (n = 35), or technical problems precluding confident 
      calcium scoring (n = 4). CAC and aorta calcification scores increased significantly 
      (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during follow-up. By 
      multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history of 
      cardiovascular event, use of a statin, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level were 
      independent determinants of CAC progression. Independent determinants of aorta 
      calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score, higher 
      pulse pressure, use of a statin, older age, higher serum phosphate level, use of 
      aspirin, and male sex. Significant regression of CAC or aorta calcification was not 
      observed in this cohort. LIMITATIONS: Cohort of prevalent KTRs with potential 
      survival bias; few patients with diabetes and nonwhites, limiting the 
      generalizability of results. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous small short-term 
      studies, we show that vascular calcification progression is substantial within 4 
      years in prevalent KTRs and is associated with several traditional and 
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors, some of which are modifiable.

TI  - Aortic calcification predicts cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 1314-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among renal 
      transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with increased mortality 
      in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic calcification among renal 
      transplant recipients is unknown. Our objective was to prospectively examine the 
      association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause 
      mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients. METHODS: One 
      hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent electron beam computed 
      tomography. Aortic calcification was scored by the Agatston method. The mean 
      follow-up time was 5.1 years. Cardiovascular events (heart failure, coronary artery 
      disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause mortality were 
      recorded. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62% Caucasians, 38% African Americans and 
      62% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 +/- 12.5 years. Thirty-four percent had 
      aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular events and 10 deaths were 
      recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification had more cardiovascular events compared 
      to those without aortic calcification (23.7 versus 4.1%, P = 0.001). Recipients with 
      aortic calcification had higher mortality compared to those without aortic 
      calcification but it did not reach statistical significance (15.8 versus 5.4%, P = 
      0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic calcification score in a proportional 
      hazard Cox model to assess event-free survival was 1.15 (1.04-1.27, P = 0.01). 
      Diabetes and aortic calcification score were independently associated with survival. 
      In addition to the predictors above, dialysis vintage was an independent predictor 
      for combined future cardiovascular event and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 
      aortic calcification is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is 
      predictive of future cardiovascular events. Aortic calcification is easily 
      identified by non-invasive testing, and should be considered when assessing 
      cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Vascular calcification in the uremic patient: a cardiovascular risk?
PG  - S119-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors suggest that the presence of vascular calcification (VC) 
      is associated with a high risk of cardiac events in uremic patients. The aim of this 
      study was to analyze the influence of VC on cardiac morbidity and mortality in our 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We studied 79 patients on HD: 43 males, mean 
      age 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. The presence of VC was 
      evaluated by radiologic series. Other cardiovascular risk factors analyzed were 
      arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cigarette smoking, anemia, and 
      dyslipidemia. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler 
      echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. During this time, clinical 
      information collected included predialysis blood pressure, incidence of ischemic 
      heart disease, episodes of congestive heart failure, and mortality due to 
      cardiovascular event. RESULTS: VC was observed in 55.7% of patients. Left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac valve calcification were 
      significantly associated with VC. Ischemic heart disease (71.4% vs. 28.6%) and 
      episodes of cardiac failure (0.41 vs. 0.18 per year; P < 0.05) appeared more 
      frequently in the patient group with VC. VC was present in 80.6% of patients who 
      developed episodes of heart failure. Eight patients died from cardiac disease; each 
      of them had VC. CONCLUSION: The presence of VC can help to identify those HD 
      patients with a higher cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Elevated Circulating Osteoprotegerin Levels in the Plasma of Hemodialyzed Patients 
      With Severe Artery Calcification.
PG  - 519-529
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12681 [doi]
AB  - We studied the correlations between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level and 
      radial artery calcification (RAC) assessed histologically and carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). Moreover, we studied the relationship between OPG 
      levels and all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality during a 5-year observation 
      period. The study comprised 59 CKD patients (36 hemodialyzed (HD), 23 predialysis). 
      The biochemical parameters included: creatinine, calcium, phosphate, intact 
      parathormone, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor II 
      (TNFRII), transforming growth factor-β, hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23, osteonectin (ON), osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin. CCA-IMT 
      and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by ultrasound. Fragments of 
      radial artery obtained during creation of HD access were prepared for microscopy and 
      stained for calcifications with alizarin red. RAC was detected in 34 patients (58%). 
      In multiple regression adjusted for dialysis status, TNFRII, ON and Framingham risk 
      score (FRS) were identified as the independent predictors of OPG. Serum OPG above 
      the median value of 7.55 pmol/L significantly predicted the presence of RAC in 
      simple logistic regression (OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.39-20.4; P = 0.012) and in multiple 
      logistic regression adjusted for FRS, dialysis status and CCA-IMT values (OR 6.56; 
      95%CI 1.06-40.6; P = 0.036). OPG levels above the median were associated with higher 
      CCA-IMT values (1.02 ± 0.10 vs. 0.86 ± 0.13; P < 0.001) and predicted the presence 
      of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery (OR 14.4; 95%CI 2.84-72.9; P < 0.001), 
      independently of FRS, dialysis status and RAC. In this study, elevated serum OPG 
      levels correlated with higher CCA-IMT, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and 
      the severity of the RAC independently of each other. During follow-up, 25 patients 
      (42%) died, including 21 due to CV causes. In multiple Cox regression, OPG above the 
      median predicted overall survival independently of dialysis status, Framingham risk 
      score, CCA-IMT above the median value, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques 
      in CCA, but not independently of RAC. We postulate that circulating OPG may play a 
      dual role as a marker for both medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis, 
      hence it seems to be a valuable tool for assessing CV risk in patients with CKD. OPG 
      might be an early indicator of all-cause mortality in CKD patients with advanced 
      medial arterial calcification.

TI  - Prevalence and progression of peripheral arterial calcifications in patients with 
      ESRD.
PG  - 140-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial calcifications are seen frequently in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, prevalence and progression, as well as 
      contributing factors, never were investigated in an unselected incident cohort of 
      dialysis patients. METHODS: We investigated 155 patients with ESRD at the beginning 
      of dialysis therapy and followed them up prospectively during the first year of 
      either hemodialysis (n = 106) or peritoneal dialysis treatment (n = 49). The 
      prevalence and progression of arterial calcifications during the first year were 
      graded by a single radiologist on standardized plain radiographs of the pelvis and 
      calves. Findings were analyzed in relation to sex, age, diabetes mellitus, dialysis 
      modality, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lipoprotein(a) 
      (Lp[a]) level, apolipoprotein(a) kringle-IV repeat polymorphism, calcium level, 
      phosphorus level, intact parathyroid hormone level, and homocysteine level. RESULTS: 
      Patients with peripheral arterial calcifications at the start of renal replacement 
      therapy (RRT) (n = 104) were significantly older (P < 0.001), had diabetes more 
      often (P < 0.001), and had greater Lp(a) concentrations (P = 0.03) and a trend to 
      greater total cholesterol concentrations. Patients with progression of 
      calcifications during the first year of RRT had significantly greater homocysteine 
      levels (P = 0.036). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients without 
      calcifications either at the beginning or after 1 year of RRT were younger (P = 
      0.01) and had significantly lower homocysteine (P = 0.004) and Lp(a) levels (P = 
      0.03) and less frequently had diabetes mellitus (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our 
      observations suggest that the prevalence of peripheral arterial calcifications in 
      patients with ESRD is related to age, diabetes mellitus, and Lp(a) and homocysteine 
      levels. Progression of arterial calcifications might be related to high plasma 
      homocysteine concentrations.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in CKD-5D  patients is tied to adverse cardiac 
      function  and increased mortality .
PG  - 291-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) and is an important predictor of mortality. 
      However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not been well 
      established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases mortality by 
      adversely affecting cardiac function. METHODS: Patients were recruited from 37 
      regional dialysis centers. 2-D and Doppler echocardiographic analyses were 
      performed, and CAC was measured using 64-slice computed tomography. Relationships 
      between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function were 
      analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: There 
      were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median age was 55 years, 
      and median duration of CKD-5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC scores 100 were found in 
      69% of patients, with 51% having a score  400. CAC was associated with measures of 
      LV systolic and diastolic function (global longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, 
      p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity (rho = -0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV 
      filling pressure (E:E'; rho = 0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed 
      these relationships after adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and 
      coronary artery disease. Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). 
      Both LV diastolic and systolic functional measures were significant predictors of 
      mortality, the strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings show a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD-5D. LV 
      diastolic function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent 
      predictors of mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in 
      CKD-5D. These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with 
      CKD-5D and describe a potentially-valuable role for echocardiography in the routine 
      management of these patients. .

TI  - Vascular calcification on plain radiographs is related with the severity of lesions 
      detected by coronary angiography in dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1620/tjem.235.135 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity in 
      dialysis patients. However, it is difficult to select the proper point for coronary 
      angiographic procedure, because dialysis patients frequently do not display typical 
      symptoms. Vascular calcification (VC) scores of artery or aorta on plain radiographs 
      are associated with CAD events and may be predictive of CAD in dialysis patients. 
      Therefore, we evaluated whether high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs 
      are related with the severity of lesions detected by coronary angiography (CAG) in 
      dialysis patients. We retrospectively enrolled dialysis patients who underwent CAG 
      and checked several plain radiographs within one year before or after CAG. 
      Significant VC is defined as high or meaningful VC scores, such as long abdominal 
      aortic calcification and medial artery calcification on feet. Of all 55 patients, 41 
      patients (74.5%) exhibited significant VC on plain radiographs and 23 patients 
      (41.8%) underwent stent insertion. Among the 23 patients, longer stents were used in 
      18 patients with significant VC (34.1 ± 19.5 mm vs. 16.6 ± 15.2 mm, P = 0.029). 
      Patients with significant VC showed higher prevalence rate of severe coronary artery 
      calcification (P = 0.007) and diffuse/tubular stenosis (P = 0.012), detected by CAG, 
      than those without significant VC. Thus, high or meaningful VC scores on plain 
      radiographs were associated with the degree of calcification or stenosis detected by 
      CAG. In conclusion, VC scores on plain radiographs may be predictive of 
      calcification or stenosis of coronary artery before CAG in dialysis patients.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem 
      in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular 
      calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate 
      human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. 
      HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels of inorganic phosphate 
      (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in media containing 
      phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 
      mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies 
      showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the 
      osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of 
      elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate 
      cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor 
      phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium 
      deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was 
      identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that 
      elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that 
      predispose to calcification and offers a novel explanation of the phenomenon of 
      vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined 
      the factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic 
      hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular 
      calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the significant factors 
      affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, 
      increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic 
      pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly 
      stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and 
      offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
      hyperphosphatemic conditions.

TI  - Cardiovascular calcification in Hispanic Americans (HA) with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) due to type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is common and severe in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on dialysis. However, the prevalence and severity of CVC is 
      less well documented in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on 
      dialysis. METHODS: Fifty-eight nondialyzed HA with type 2 diabetes and CKD were 
      enrolled. They comprise 29 patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD (early CKD group) and 26 
      patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (advanced CKD group). Coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) was measured by ultrafast spiral computed tomography, while peripheral artery 
      calcification (PAC) was evaluated by plain x-ray of the chest, pelvis, thighs, and 
      lower extremities. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC and PAC were significantly higher 
      in the advanced CKD group compared to the early CKD group (73% vs. 38%; P < 0.01 and 
      85% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001, respectively). The median CAC scores were 18-fold greater 
      in the advanced CKD group (138.9 vs. 7.8, respectively). By linear regression 
      analysis, a strong association was found between the level of renal function and ln 
      total volume of CAC. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that CAC and PAC are common and 
      severe in HA diabetic patients with CKD not previously treated with dialysis, 
      calcium-based phosphate binders, or vitamin D analogues. Lower level of renal 
      function is associated with increased burden of vascular calcification in 
      predialysis patients with CKD.

TI  - Traditional and non-traditional risk factors as contributors to atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 405-16
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although traditional risk factors, 
      such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and advanced age, are 
      prevalent in ESRD patients they may not be sufficient by themselves to account for 
      the high prevalence of CVD in patients with this condition. Thus, the search for 
      other, non-traditional, risk factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of 
      uremic CVD has been an area of intense study. Data suggest that the accelerated 
      atherosclerotic process of ESRD may involve several interrelated processes, such as 
      oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and vascular calcification, in a milieu of 
      constant low-grade inflammation. The cause(s) of inflammation in ESRD are 
      multifactorial and, while it may reflect underlying CVD, an acute-phase reaction may 
      also be a direct cause of vascular injury via several pathogenetic mechanisms. 
      Available data suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a central role in the 
      genesis of both malnutrition and CVD in ESRD. Thus, it could be speculated that 
      suppression of the vicious cycle of malnutrition, inflammation and atherosclerosis 
      (MIA syndrome) would improve survival in dialysis patients. Recent evidence has 
      demonstrated strong associations between inflammation and both increased oxidative 
      stress and endothelial dysfunction in ESRD patients. As there is not yet any 
      recognized, or even proposed, treatment for ESRD patients with chronic inflammation 
      it would be of obvious interest to study the long-term effect of various 
      anti-inflammatory treatment strategies on the nutritional and cardiovascular status 
      as well as outcome of these patients.

TI  - Prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in hemodialysis patients--a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0026-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery calcification has been reported to be an independent 
      risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also, existence of a positive correlation has been 
      reported between the presence of arterial calcification and that of ischemic changes 
      in the area supplied by such arteries. While intracranial artery calcification has 
      frequently been observed on computed tomographic (CT) images of the brain in 
      hemodialysis patients, its prevalence has not been reported previously. We 
      investigated our hemodialysis outpatients to determine the prevalence of 
      intracranial artery calcification in these patients in comparison with that in 
      healthy controls. METHODS: Brain CT examinations were performed in 107 patients 
      under maintenance hemodialysis therapy. For comparison, 43 representatives of the 
      general population who underwent a brain CT examination as part of a health checkup 
      were also studied as control subjects. RESULTS: Intracranial calcifications were 
      more frequently found among hemodialysis patients (87.9%) than among control 
      subjects (53.5%, P = 0.0003), and the prevalences of calcification in each of the 
      intracranial arteries in the two groups were as follows: vertebral artery (65.5% vs. 
      25.6%, P = 0.0002), internal carotid artery (62.1% vs. 18.6%, P < 0.0001), basilar 
      artery (34.5% vs. 34.9%, ns), anterior cerebral artery (0 vs. 2.3%, ns), middle 
      cerebral artery (24.1% vs. 20.9%, ns), and posterior cerebral artery (5.2% vs. 4.7%, 
      ns). CONCLUSIONS: A much higher rate of intracranial artery calcification was 
      observed in hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and the most 
      frequently involved sites of calcification in these patients were the relatively 
      large intracranial arteries.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of coronary and aortic calcifications assessed by chest 
      CT in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcifications independently predict cardiovascular 
      events (CVE) in the general population. We assessed the prevalence and determinants 
      of coronary (CAC) and thoracic aorta (AoC) calcifications in renal transplant 
      recipients (RTR). METHODS: Consecutive RTR living in Belgium, with an isolated 
      kidney graft functioning for more than 1 year, were asked to participate. They 
      underwent a 16-slice spiral computerized tomography in order to measure calcium 
      mass. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and urinary parameters were recorded. 
      RESULTS: We included 281 patients. CAC and AoC were detected in 81 and 85%, with 
      geometric means (SD) of 52.2 (4.9) and 99.3 (8.2) mg, respectively. By multiple 
      linear regression, independent predictors of both types of calcifications included 
      older age, longer time on dialysis, a history of CVE, of multiple transplantations 
      and of smoking. Other determinants of CAC were male gender, current statin use and 
      history of parathyroidectomy, and other determinants of AoC included higher pulse 
      pressure, shorter time under mycophenolate mofetil and current use of 
      anti-vitamin-K. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of both CAC and AoC is substantial in 
      RTR. We delineate independent determinants either common to both CAC and AoC or 
      specific to one, and known as classic or chronic kidney disease related risk 
      factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular disease and major extremity amputation are common in 
      patients with established renal failure and are associated with considerable 
      morbidity. Several studies have shown high rates of amputation following 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, but there is minimal literature on the 
      incidence of amputation following renal transplantation. Furthermore, there is 
      little evidence regarding the best method of predicting which patients might be at 
      risk of developing peripheral vascular complications after transplantation. METHODS: 
      We undertook a 5 year follow-up on the cohort of patients who were on our renal 
      transplant waiting list 5 years ago (January 2007). At this time, it was standard 
      practice within our unit for all patients to have routine pelvic x-rays to assess 
      for vascular calcification of the iliac vessels at the time of activation onto the 
      transplant waiting list. Any patients with moderate/severe calcification on x-ray, 
      which may complicate transplantation, were referred for computed tomography 
      angiogram (CTA) of their aorto-iliac vessels. Mortality, transplantation outcomes, 
      and amputation rates at 5 years were correlated with the severity of calcification 
      on preoperative imaging. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were on the 
      waiting list for renal transplantation in January 2007 (92 men; mean age, 58.3 +/- 
      6.2 years). Ninety-three patients received a transplant during the subsequent 5 
      years. By January 2012, 82 patients had a functioning transplant, 45 remained on the 
      waiting list (5 suspended), 40 patients had died, and 20 were alive but no longer on 
      the waiting list. Seventy-three (39.5%) had moderate or severe calcification on 
      plain x-ray and went on to have CTA. Of these patients, 16 (21.9%) had extensive 
      calcification affecting all the iliac vessels and were removed from the waiting list 
      as a result. Preoperative imaging was useful in determining the side for surgery in 
      a further 18 patients (24.3%). Twenty-two patients developed vascular complications. 
      Nineteen (86.4%) had moderate-severe vascular calcification on imaging. Four of the 
      patients with vascular complications (18.2%) underwent transplantation (2 had below 
      knee amputation (BKA) prior to transplantation; 1 developed distal ischemia on the 
      same side as the transplantation 2 years postoperatively; 1 had bilateral above knee 
      amputation (AKA) approximately 2 years after transplantation). Eleven (50%) of the 
      patients with vascular complications were dead at 5 years of follow-up. Mortality 
      and amputation rates were higher in patients with moderate-severe calcification than 
      minimal calcification (30.1% vs 16.6%; P = .02 and 10.9% vs 1.8%; P = .003, 
      respectively). There was no difference in rates of delayed graft function (DGF), 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), or creatinine at 1 year between patients who 
      underwent transplantation with moderate-severe calcification and those without, 
      however, intraoperative vascular complications (26.7% vs 3%; P < .001), graft loss 
      (28.1% vs 3.4%; P = .01), and death with a functioning transplant (9.7% vs 1.6%; P = 
      .04) rates were higher in patients with extensive calcification compared with those 
      without. CONCLUSIONS: Plain x-ray of the pelvis is a useful screening tool to 
      identify those patients who may require further detailed vascular imaging prior to 
      transplantation. Amputation rates following renal transplantation are low and 
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in isolation should not preclude transplantation. 
      Nevertheless, significant vascular calcification is predictive of mortality both 
      with and without transplantation and graft loss in patients with a renal transplant.

TI  - A simple vascular calcification score predicts cardiovascular risk in haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1480-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients and have been recently associated with vascular 
      calcifications. The objective of our study was to assess the value of a simple 
      vascular calcification score for the prediction of cardiovascular death, 
      cardiovascular hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in HD 
      patients, and to correlate this score with cardiovascular disease and with other 
      known predictors of vascular disease. METHODS: In this observational, prospective 
      study 123 chronic HD patients (75 males and 48 females; 20% diabetic) were included, 
      who were on low-flux HD treatment for 46.6+/-52 months (mean+/-SD). We set up a 
      simple vascular calcification score based on plain radiographic films of pelvis and 
      hands. Brachial pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and 
      cardiovascular events and hospitalization episodes were assessed. RESULTS: During an 
      observational period of 37 months there were 17 cardiovascular deaths; 28 patients 
      needed cardiovascular hospitalizations and 32 patients suffered fatal and non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 43 patients (35%), 
      peripheral arterial disease in 33 patients (26.8%), cerebrovascular disease in 16 
      patients (13%) and vascular disease (coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial 
      disease or cerebral vascular disease) in 61 patients (49.6%). By binary logistic 
      regression, diabetes (P = 0.01), male sex (P<0.001), age (P = 0.02), HD duration (P 
      = 0.02) and MAP (P = 0.03) were independently associated with a vascular score > or 
      =3. This score > or =3 was independently associated with coronary artery disease (P 
      = 0.008), peripheral arterial disease (P<0.001) and vascular disease (P = 0.001). 
      Patients with a vascular calcification score > or =3 had a 3.9-fold higher risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.03), a 2.8-fold higher risk of cardiovascular 
      hospitalizations (P = 0.02) and a 2.3-fold higher risk of fatal or non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The present vascular calcification 
      scoring represents a simple tool for the assessment of cardiovascular risk related 
      with vascular calcifications in chronic HD patients.

      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.
PG  - 33-9
LID - AOP62 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dialysis patients presents increased arterial stiffness. Results of 
      available studies comparing arterial stiffness in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients 
      vs hemodialysis (HD) patients are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was 
      to compare pulse wave velocity (PWV) in PD and HD patients and to compare value of 
      measured PWV (PWV(M)) with theoretical value of this parameter (PWV(T)) calculated 
      using formula developed by Blacher et al. From the equation it is apparent that PWV 
      increases by 0.8 m/s for each decade of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Carotid-femoral 
      PWV(M) was measured in 35 PD and 26 HD patients, using Complior device. In all 
      patients PWV(T) was also calculated. RESULTS: The study groups did not differ 
      significantly with respect to age, gender, and prevalence of diabetes. The value of 
      PWV(M) (PD:12.1 ± 3.3 vs HD:12.0 ± 3.0 m/s) and PWV(T) (PD:10.0 ± 1.4 vs HD:9.9 ± 
      1.2 m/s) did not differ significantly between PD and HD. PWV(M) was significantly 
      higher than PWVT in both, PD and HD patients. Diastolic blood pressure and mean 
      arterial pressure was higher in PD patients, but systolic blood pressure and pulse 
      pressure did not differ significantly. In PD patients a higher number of 
      antihypertensive medications was used (3 ± 1 vs 2 ± 1;p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial 
      stiffness is equally high in peritoneal dialysis patients and in hemodialysis 
      patients. Measured value of PWV in both, PD and HD patients, is significantly higher 
      when compared with theoretical value of PWV. This finding may reflect accelerated 
      arterial aging in patients on dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are prone to neointimal hyperplasia leading 
      to AVG failure. We hypothesized that pre-existing pathologic abnormalities of the 
      vessels used to create AVGs (including venous intimal hyperplasia, arterial intimal 
      hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification) are associated 
      with inferior AVG survival. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing placement of a new AVG 
      at a large medical center who had vascular specimens obtained at the time of surgery 
      (n = 76). PREDICTOR: Maximal intimal thickness of the arterial and venous intima, 
      arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial medial calcification. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: 
      Unassisted primary AVG survival (time to first intervention) and frequency of AVG 
      interventions. RESULTS: 55 patients (72%) underwent interventions and 148 graft 
      interventions occurred during 89.9 years of follow-up (1.65 interventions per 
      graft-year). Unassisted primary AVG survival was not associated significantly with 
      arterial intimal thickness (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.27; P = 0.3), venous intimal 
      thickness (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; P = 0.1), severe arterial medial fibrosis 
      (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.06; P = 0.6), or severe arterial calcification (HR, 0.68; 
      95% CI, 0.37-1.31; P = 0.3). The frequency of AVG interventions per year was 
      associated inversely with arterial intimal thickness (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% 
      CI, 1.16-3.42; P < 0.001 for thickness <10 vs. >25 μm), venous intimal thickness 
      (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001 for thickness <5 vs. >10 μm), arterial 
      medial fibrosis (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.96-5.13; P < 0.001 for fibrosis <70% vs. ≥70%), 
      and arterial calcification (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.31-3.43; P = 0.001 for <10% vs. ≥10% 
      calcification). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study. Study may be underpowered to 
      demonstrate differences in unassisted primary AVG survival. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pre-existing vascular pathologic abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease may not be associated significantly with unassisted primary AVG survival. 
      However, vascular intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial 
      calcification may be associated with a decreased frequency of AVG interventions.

TI  - The link between bone and coronary calcifications in CKD-5 patients on 
      haemodialysis.
PG  - 1010-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current study was designed to evaluate 
      the associations between bone turnover/volume and coronary artery calcifications 
      (CAC). METHODS: In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multislice computed tomography 
      of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant biochemical parameters were 
      done. The large number of CKD-5 patients enrolled allowed separate evaluation of 
      patients with CAC versus patients without CAC and adjustment for traditional and 
      non-traditional risk factors for CAC. RESULTS: When all patients were analysed, 
      associations were found between CAC and bone turnover, bone volume, age, gender and 
      dialysis vintage. When only patients with CAC were included, there was a U-shaped 
      relationship between CAC and bone turnover, whilst the association with bone volume 
      was lost. In these patients, the relationship of CAC with age, gender and dialysis 
      vintage remained. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender 
      and dialysis vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal 
      osteodystrophy amenable to treatment should be considered in the management of 
      patients with CAC.

AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis 
      vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This study 
      examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in brachial 
      and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven 
      radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine predialysis 
      and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender matched controls 
      undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation (6 renal). Arterial 
      stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology, morphometric analysis of 
      intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load was performed using standard 
      techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients demonstrated significant arterial 
      intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio higher than controls (0.13 ± 0.12 vs. 
      0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium deposition was demonstrated on histology and the 
      calcium content in patients was higher than controls (34.68 ± 26.86 vs. 
      10.95 ± 9.18 μg/μg, p = 0.003). The blood vessel calcium content correlated with 
      arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p = 0.018). This study for the first time describes, 
      and suggests mechanistic linkage between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium 
      deposition, and increased functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis 
      patients. Our research could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the 
      uremic vasculature impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Little is known about the proportion of renal transplant candidates who are 
      considered ineligible by the transplant center, the reasons of their ineligibility 
      and their survival during dialysis. In this retrospective, single-center study of 
      445 adult patients referred between 2001 and 2006, 36 (8%) were deemed ineligible 
      for medical contraindications. The leading reason was cardiovascular (CV) (75%), 
      specifically aorto-iliac, and/or limb vessels atheromatosis or calcifications; 
      ischemic heart disease; or a combination thereof. Nine patients had other 
      contraindications that were absolute for three of them; six patients displayed a 
      combination of relative contraindications. When compared to eligible patients (N = 
      409), those ineligible were significantly older (60 yr vs. 48), more often diabetics 
      (50% vs. 15%), obese (39% vs. 17%) suffering from coronary artery disease (53% vs. 
      11%) and peripheral arterial disease (86% vs. 11%). Their primary nephropathy was 
      more often diabetic and/or hypertensive/nephroangiosclerosis (61% vs. 23%), and 
      their median dialysis vintage prior to evaluation was longer (29 months vs. 10, p < 
      0.0001). The actuarial survival of ineligible patients was significantly lower than 
      that of eligible patients (at five yr: 53% vs. 88%). Adequate control of CV risk 
      factors before dialysis and early referral for transplantation might help to improve 
      eligibility of renal transplant candidates.

TI  - Predictors of coronary disease in patients with end stage renal disease.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Patients with end stage renal disease have a high prevalence of cardiovascular 
      disease and coronary arteriography is often routinely performed prior to kidney 
      transplantation. However, the value of the conventional risk factors and 
      non-invasive markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) in triaging patients for 
      coronary arteriography has not been fully examined. 116 patients with end stage 
      renal disease were evaluated. Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients 
      either for a suspicion of CAD or as part of a routine pre-transplant evaluation. 
      Lesions causing > or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis in any of the three major 
      coronary artery systems were considered significant. The mean age was 53.3 +/- 9.3 
      years. Significant CAD was present in 69 patients (60%). Increasing age, family 
      history of premature ischemic heart disease, the presence of angina, abnormal Q 
      waves on the ECG or abnormal ST segment depression and the presence of coronary 
      calcification were significant markers of coronary artery disease. However male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus and obesity did not correlate with coronary disease. Even 
      though hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking were also not useful 
      predictors these could have been modified by the renal failure. In conclusion 
      increasing age, a family history of premature ischemic heart disease and some 
      non-invasive markers were useful predictors of coronary disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian 
      patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF). METHODS: 
      Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. Predictors of 
      patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency rates. RESULTS: 
      Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 
      months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Univariate analysis 
      showed that factors which predict for patency include male gender (p = 0.003), good 
      diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031), pre-dialysis status (p = 
      0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and non-calcified radial arteries (p = 
      0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 
      0.472) did not predict for primary AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the 
      male gender to be an independent predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). 
      Subset analysis showed a significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 
      mm amongst males, as compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no 
      statistical difference in the average cephalic vein diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Within 
      our Asian study population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 
      58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Male 
      gender is an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. In females or patients with 
      calcified radial arteries, a more proximal AVF should be considered.

TI  - Large artery calcification on dialysis patients is located in the intima and related 
      to atherosclerosis.
PG  - 303-10
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04290510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) has a significant effect in 
      cardiovascular diseases on dialysis patients. However, VC is assessed with 
      x-ray-based techniques, which do not inform about calcium localization (intima, 
      media, atherosclerosis-related). The aim of this work is to study VC and its related 
      factors using arterial ultrasound to report the exact location of calcium. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, 
      case-control study that included 232 patients in dialysis and 208 age- and 
      sex-matched controls with normal kidney function. Demographic data and laboratory 
      values were collated. Carotid, femoral, and brachial ultrasounds were performed to 
      assess VC and atherosclerosis burden using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: 
      Cardiovascular risk factors were predominantly found in controls, although the 
      burden of atherosclerosis was higher in the dialysis group. VC was significantly 
      more prevalent in the group of patients on dialysis than control subjects, and in 
      both groups the most prevalent pattern of VC was linear calcification located in the 
      intima of the artery wall. Age and undergoing dialysis (with or without previous 
      cardiovascular diseases) were positively and significantly associated with linear 
      calcification. Conversely, the absence of atherosclerosis and low levels of 
      C-reactive protein and phosphorus significantly impeded the development of linear 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: VC in large, conduit arteries is more prevalent in 
      patients on dialysis than controls and is predominantly located in a linear fashion 
      in the intima of the arteries.

TI  - Upper limb vascular calcification score as a predictor of mortality in diabetic 
      hemodialysis patients.

LID - S0741-5214(15)00128-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2015.01.026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular 
      calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (Mönckeberg disease). 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs 
      and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) 
      creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications 
      outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for 
      ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white 
      echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then 
      applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits 
      (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained 
      ≥ 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum 
      calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was 
      compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a 
      high VcS ≥ 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier 
      statistics were used for comparisons among the groups. RESULTS: Nineteen patients 
      had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS ≥ 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a 
      mean age of 68 ± 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to 
      a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central 
      venous catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 
      ± 41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 ± 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months), and 
      66.7 ± 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009). Forty-seven 
      patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in the controls; P 
      = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%, 65.7%, 54.8%, and 
      48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II; and 97.7%, 93.1%, 
      76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 for all groups; P = 
      .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or without CVCs at 
      baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc had lower survival 
      rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%) and at 3 years (47.7% vs 
      75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of death only in subgroup II 
      patients compared with the subcontrol group patients (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, 
      respectively; P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic hemodialysis patients exposed to high 
      levels of upper extremity arterial medial VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased 
      long-term mortality risk compared with diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and 
      receiving the same access. Patients with CVCs/Vc had the lowest survival rates.

TI  - Aortic calcifications and arterial stiffness as predictors of cardiovascular events 
      in incident renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.1111/tri.12151 [doi]
AB  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. 
      Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known CV risk 
      factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine the 
      prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We 
      conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar 
      X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 
      patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 
      32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV subgroup. When 
      we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 
      unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) 
      remained an independent predictor of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using 
      receiver operating characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV 
      events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC 
      are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR population. These 
      vascular assessments are readily available and easy to perform, making them ideal 
      tools for further risk stratification. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00547040).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) 
      is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by 
      cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality. METHODS: In 231 ESRD 
      patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, 
      prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were 
      quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of 
      total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were 
      also analysed. RESULTS: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more 
      often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 
      and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox 
      proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause 
      mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and 
      subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) 
      showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly 
      associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from 
      DXA. CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of 
      agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than 
      those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with 
      high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an 
      important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 1942-7
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in renal transplant 
      recipients. Although renal transplant recipients frequently undergo cardiac 
      functional tests prior to surgery, coronary atherosclerosis can remain undetected. 
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC), an early marker of atherosclerosis can be 
      quantified using EBCT. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent and 
      characteristics of CAC at the time of renal transplantation. We evaluated 79 
      consecutive incident asymptomatic renal transplant recipients. Patients were mostly 
      White (62%), male (54%) and had a deceased donor renal transplant (61%). The mean 
      age was 47 (12.1) years. Sixty-five percentage of subjects had CAC. The mean CAC 
      score was 331.5 (562.4) with a median of 43.3. Older age, presence of diabetes, not 
      having a preemptive transplant, deceased donor transplantation and 
      hypercholesterolemia were significantly associated with presence of CAC 
      univariately. Median CAC scores were significantly increased in subjects with 
      diabetes (127.8 vs. 28.9, p=0.05), exposed to dialysis (102.9 vs. 3.7, p<0.001) and 
      deceased donor recipients (169.7 vs. 7.5, p=0.02). Using multiple logistic 
      regression, age and time on dialysis were significantly associated with the presence 
      of CAC at the time of transplant. In summary, CAC is prevalent in patients 
      undergoing kidney transplant. CAC may be a method to identify renal transplant 
      recipients at increased risk for future cardiovascular events.

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin, arterial stiffness, and mortality in normoalbuminemic 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1695-701
LID - 10.1007/s00198-010-1377-0 [doi]
AB  - A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor for vascular 
      calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. OPG and pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV) were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (>3 years) 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients who were prospectively followed for 6 years. In 
      long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, OPG levels were strongly 
      linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome. INTRODUCTION: A high 
      circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for vascular calcification and 
      mortality in Western chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients but it is not known if 
      this is true for Japanese CKD patients, where a different risk profile may operate. 
      METHODS: OPG and PWV were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term 
      (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients (median age 62 years) who were 
      prospectively followed for 6 years. RESULTS: OPG levels were associated in 
      multivariate analysis with age, dialysis vintage, history of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD) and parathyroid hormone levels. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate 
      with OPG. Patients with clinical history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels 
      and OPG levels were positively correlated to PWV, an index of arterial stiffness. 
      These associations were independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes. 
      During the follow-up period, 40 deaths, including 25 cardiovascular deaths, were 
      recorded. In crude analysis, each unit of increase in OPG was associated with 
      increased all-cause (hazard ratios 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD 
      mortality (1.14 [1.07-1.21]), which persisted after adjustment for age, sex, 
      dialysis vintage, diabetes, and baseline CVD (1.12 [1.05-1.19] and 1.11 [1.02-1.19], 
      all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In long-term 
      normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, with low prevalence of 
      inflammation, OPG levels were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse 
      outcome.

TI  - A case-control study of calciphylaxis in Japanese end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 1580-4
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr658 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and 
      often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is characterized by painful 
      skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification and intimal proliferation of small 
      arteries. Studies in western countries have reported incidences ranging from 1 to 4% 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients. Since no systematic studies of calciphylaxis have 
      ever been performed in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey and a case-control 
      study to identify the characteristics of calciphylaxis in the Japanese dialysis 
      population. METHODS: Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760 hemodialysis centers 
      in Japan, asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been encountered in the past, and 
      detailed clinical data regarding each case were then collected from the centers. In 
      addition, two control dialysis patients matched for age and duration of hemodialysis 
      to each calciphylaxis case were identified at the participating centers, and their 
      data were analyzed to identify risk factors for calciphylaxis. RESULTS: Responses to 
      the questionnaire were obtained from 1838 centers (48.3%), and 151 centers reported 
      that a total of 249 cases had been encountered. Sixty-four centers agreed to 
      participate in the case-control study, and detailed clinical data in regard to 67 
      cases were obtained. In 28 of the 67 cases, a definite diagnosis of calciphylaxis 
      was made by our study group based on the clinical characteristics and skin biopsy 
      findings. A univariate logistic regression model comparing them with 56-matched 
      controls identified warfarin therapy [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI)] 2.7-48.1, P=0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR 19.8, 95% 
      CI 4.4-89.5, P=0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma glucose level (OR 3.74, 
      95% CI 1.08-12.9, P=0.037) and each 1 mg/dL increment in adjusted serum calcium 
      level (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.63-6.30, P=0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly 
      associated with calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with 
      female gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted 
      calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin therapy and 
      lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk factors after a multivariate 
      logistic regression model analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed 
      that warfarin therapy and lower serum albumin levels are significant and strong risk 
      factors for the development of calciphylaxis in chronic hemodialysis patients in 
      Japan.

TI  - Association between AST-120 and abdominal aortic calcification in predialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1007/s10157-012-0717-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with mortality and cardiovascular 
      events in patients with chronic kidney disease. AST-120, which adsorbs uremic 
      toxins, is reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death in 
      chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate the 
      association between abdominal aortic calcification and the use of AST-120 in 
      predialysis chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted including 199 predialysis chronic kidney disease patients (stages 4 and 5) 
      who underwent abdominal plain computed tomography in our institution between 2005 
      and 2010. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by aortic calcification index 
      (ACI). Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not AST-120 was 
      administered for at least six months, and ACI was compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: The aortic calcification index was significantly lower in patients taking 
      AST-120 [12.2 (2.5-30.3) vs. 25.7 (13.4-45.3) %, P < 0.001]. According to 
      multivariate linear regression analysis, the use of AST-120 was independently and 
      significantly correlated with ACI after adjusting for confounding factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of AST-120 was independently associated with less aortic 
      calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.

TI  - High prevalence of vertebral fractures assessed by quantitative morphometry in 
      hemodialysis patients, strongly associated with vascular calcifications.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1007/s00223-013-9722-x [doi]
AB  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) 
      and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional, 
      observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular 
      calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 ± 14.1 years, 63 % 
      males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests 
      included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and undercarboxylated), and total 
      matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for 
      the detection of VF, defined as reduction by ≥20 % of one of the vertebral body 
      dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. 
      Prevalence of VF was 55.3 % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control 
      group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; 
      OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and age (mean ± SD 66.7 ± 13.1 vs. 61.0 ± 14.7 years, 
      p < 0.001; OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The 
      prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in 
      controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association 
      with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 
      ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 
      1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion, 
      the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is high in 
      hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency is also 
      associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate 
      fractures in renal patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher mortality 
      in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to correlate 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS: A survival 
      analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed by multidetector-row 
      computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0∼105 U), group 2 (110∼1067 
      U), and group 3 (1094∼15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months. 
      Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD 
      duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly 
      lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and 52.2%, 
      respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%, respectively). Cox 
      proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration revealed that 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than 
      those of groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: CACS is helpful to predict prognosis of HD 
      patients independently of age and HD duration.

PG  - 2929-2939
LID - 10.1177/0300060519848949 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic dialysis patients and is 
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the role of circulating 
      microRNAs (miRs) in vascular calcification has rarely been investigated. We aimed to 
      determine circulating levels of miRs in hemodialysis patients, and analyzed their 
      relationship with vascular calcification. METHODS: Sixty-one stable hemodialysis 
      patients were enrolled, including 31 with vascular calcification and 30 without. 
      Demographic and biochemical data were collected and reviewed. The presence and 
      severity of vascular calcification were determined by lumber spine X-ray. Blood 
      levels of miR29a/b, miR223, miR9, and miR21 were determined. RESULTS: Patients with 
      vascular calcification were older (65.6 ± 9.0 vs. 59.1 ± 7.1 years) with a higher 
      proportion of vascular disease (55% vs. 23%) than those without vascular 
      calcification. Additionally, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (3.90 vs 2.09 
      mg/dL) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (17311 vs. 6306 pg/mL) were significantly 
      higher. Patients with vascular calcification also had higher levels of miR29a/b and 
      miR223. Regression analysis indicated that age and miR29a were significant 
      associates of the calcification score. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients with 
      vascular calcification had higher levels of miR 29a/b and miR223 than those without 
      vascular calcification, and circulating miR29a was associated with calcification 
      severity.

TI  - The association between the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary calcification 
      may differ depending on kidney function in a healthy population.
PG  - e0185522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185522 [doi]
LID - e0185522
AB  - BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio has been reported to be one of the 
      strongest risk predictors of cardiovascular events. However, its prognostic value 
      for cardiovascular disease is still uncertain, especially in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease. This study aimed to investigate whether the association between the 
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary artery calcification differed according to 
      kidney function in a healthy population. METHODS: Of the data from 7,780 
      participants from the medical records database in Gangnam Severance Hospital from 
      2005 through 2016, a cross-sectional analysis included participants with an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 determined based on 
      the Chronic Kidney Disease -Epidemiology Collaboration equation (n  =  1,800). Mild 
      renal insufficiency was defined as an eGFR of 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Coronary artery 
      calcification measured with computed tomography was defined as an above-zero score. 
      Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between coronary 
      calcification and the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio according to eGFR by adjusting for 
      the influence of confounders. RESULTS: The mean apolipoprotein B/A-I level was 
      significantly higher in the participants with coronary artery calcification than in 
      the participants without coronary artery calcification. The apolipoprotein B/A-I 
      ratio was significantly different according to coronary artery calcification in the 
      participants with normal kidney function, but in the participants with mild renal 
      insufficiency, it was not different. After adjusting for age, male sex, systolic 
      blood pressure, body mass index, current smoking status, and fasting plasma glucose, 
      the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk 
      of coronary artery calcification in participants with normal kidney function (odds 
      ratio = 2.411, p = 0.011), while in the participants with mild renal insufficiency, 
      the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was not associated with coronary artery 
      calcification. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the predictive value of 
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio for coronary artery calcification may differ according to 
      kidney function.

TI  - Vascular access calcification predicts mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1582-7
LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.458 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk 
      factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this 
      disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 
      49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or 
      synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of 
      time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by 
      logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently 
      related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality 
      risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was 
      an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular 
      access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased 
      mortality risk.

TI  - Aortic stiffness is associated with vascular calcification and remodeling in a 
      chronic kidney disease rat model.
PG  - F1431-6
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00079.2011 [doi]
AB  - Increased aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) reflects increased arterial stiffness and 
      is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We 
      examined functional and structural correlations among PWV, aortic calcification, and 
      vascular remodeling in a rodent model of CKD, the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat. 
      Hemodynamic parameters and beat-to-beat aortic PWV were recorded in 
      urethane-anesthetized animals [12-wk-old hypertensive female LPK rats (n = 5)] 
      before the onset of end-stage renal disease and their age- and sex-matched 
      normotensive controls (Lewis, n = 6). Animals were euthanized, and the aorta was 
      collected to measure calcium content by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A 
      separate cohort of animals (n = 5/group) were anesthetized with pentobarbitone 
      sodium and pressure perfused with formalin, and the aorta was collected for 
      histomorphometry, which allowed calculation of aortic wall thickness, medial 
      cross-sectional area (MCSA), elastic modulus (EM), and wall stress (WS), size and 
      density of smooth muscle nuclei, and relative content of lamellae, interlamellae 
      elastin, and collagen. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PWV were significantly 
      greater in the LPK compared with Lewis (72 and 33%, respectively) animals. The LPK 
      group had 6.8-fold greater aortic calcification, 38% greater aortic MCSA, 56% 
      greater EM/WS, 13% greater aortic wall thickness, 21% smaller smooth muscle cell 
      area, and 20% less elastin density with no difference in collagen fiber density. 
      These findings demonstrate vascular remodeling and increased calcification with a 
      functional increase in PWV and therefore aortic stiffness in hypertensive LPK rats.

AB  - It is uncertain whether moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) or measures of kidney 
      function are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis as represented by coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC) or abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). We used logistic and linear 
      regression analyses to relate CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), 
      cystatin C (cysC), and microalbuminuria (MA) with CAC and AAC obtained using 
      multidetector computed tomography in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants 
      (mean age 59 years, 55.3% women). Increased CAC and AAC were defined as > or =90th 
      percentile age- and gender-specific cutpoints based on a healthy referent sample. 
      Major cardiovascular disease risk factors were accounted for in multivariable 
      models. Of 1,179 participants, 1,174 had AAC measurements and 1,147 had CAC 
      measurements, 6.3% had CKD, and 8.3% had MA. CKD was not associated with CAC 
      (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] for CKD 1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.59 
      to 2.36, p = 0.63) or AAC (multivariable-adjusted OR for CKD 1.11, 95% confidence 
      interval 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.73). CysC was associated with CAC in age- and 
      gender-adjusted but not in multivariable models (age- and gender-adjusted OR for log 
      cysC per SD increment and CAC 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.41, p = 0.04; 
      multivariable-adjusted OR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.38, p = 0.15). MA 
      was not associated with CAC (OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.61, p = 
      0.54). Neither cysC nor MA was significantly associated with AAC in age- and gender- 
      or multivariable-adjusted models. In conclusion, CKD, cysC, and MA are not 
      associated with CAC or AAC when accounting for cardiovascular disease risk factors.

TI  - Mitral annular calcification predicts mortality and coronary artery disease in end 
      stage renal disease.
PG  - 348-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether mitral annular calcification (MAC) 
      predicts mortality and cardiac disease in a group of renal transplant candidates. 
      METHODS: Hundred and forty patients were prospectively studied. All had 
      echocardiography and coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) 
      was defined as luminal stenosis >70% by visual estimation in at least one coronary 
      artery. RESULTS: There were 21 deaths over a follow-up period of 2.2+/-0.7 years. 
      MAC occurred in 56 patients (40%) and was associated with higher mortality (p=0.04). 
      Patients with MAC were older (p=or<0.001), had larger left ventricular (LV) end 
      systolic (p=0.005) and LV end diastolic (p=0.04) diameter, larger left atrial 
      diameter (p=0.001), lower LV fractional shortening (p=0.003), larger LV mass index 
      (p=0.04) and higher mitral E/Ea ratio (p=0.03) compared to those without. Plasma 
      calcium (p=0.002), phosphate (p=0.004), cardiac troponin T (p=0.03), N-terminal 
      Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (p=0.004) concentrations were higher in those with 
      MAC but gender, total cholesterol, haemoglobin and creatinine were similar in the 
      two groups. The proportion diabetic (p=0.03), on dialysis (p=0.05), with significant 
      CAD (p=or<0.001), taking calcium containing phosphate binders (p=0.02) and Vitamin 
      D3 (p=0.04) was significantly higher in those with MAC. Significant CAD (OR 12, 95% 
      CI 3.25, p=0.001) was the only independent associate of MAC. CONCLUSIONS: MAC is 
      associated with increased mortality and significant CAD in ESRD. These patients have 
      increased LV cavity size, poorer LV systolic function, higher LV filling pressures 
      compared to patients without MAC.

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently 
      related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated 
      the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis 
      dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional 
      analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without 
      manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% 
      hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal 
      visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF 
      as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate 
      logistic regression. CAC (calcium score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those 
      presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male 
      gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference 
      (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 
      85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the 
      multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left 
      ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the 
      presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained 
      associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is 
      independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is an almost universal disease of human kind and involves 
      infiltration of lipids, inflammation and calcification in the subintimal space. 
      Coronary artery calcium (CAC) accumulates within the context of subintimal 
      atherosclerosis and is a highly specific marker of pre-clinical disease. The 
      prognostic significance of CAC has been elucidated during the past 20 years of 
      research and it is now considered the best non-invasive marker to enhance prediction 
      of adverse events in the general population as well as several disease states, such 
      as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and HIV. However, the prognostic 
      significance of CAC is not the same for all carriers of this marker, although it is 
      well established that its absence is associated with an extremely low and 
      long-lasting probability of cardiovascular events even in subjects at high risk. In 
      this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical 
      significance of CAC in patients of different race, sex and age and summarize the 
      current recommendations on its use in clinical practice.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification and atherosclerosis at the initiation of hemodialysis 
      in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 360-9
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery 
      calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship 
      between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with 
      ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC 
      and CAP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
      multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
      respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence 
      of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were 
      also evaluated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found 
      in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria 
      and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with 
      age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant 
      for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
      (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high 
      OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP 
      were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk 
      factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be 
      an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong 
      relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.

TI  - Impact of ENPP1 genotype on arterial calcification in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates 
      inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological 
      inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with 
      generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q 
      variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with 
      end-stage renal failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 79 patients with 
      end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the 
      ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype 
      (n=15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and 
      duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary 
      calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was 
      measured by pulse-wave analysis. RESULTS: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a 
      significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30; P=0.033), and also a 
      higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK 
      genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study 
      suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification 
      of patients with end-stage renal failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q 
      polymorphism have higher coronary calcification scores and increased aortic 
      stiffness, and may benefit from more intense treatment in order to prevent 
      progression of arterial calcification.

TI  - Arterial location-specific calcification at the carotid artery and aortic arch for 
      chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
PG  - 267-74
LID - 10.1007/s00223-014-9891-2 [doi]
AB  - Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but 
      controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and dyslipidemia in 
      altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three different arterial 
      locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid artery (ICA) origins. 
      Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and its orifices were 
      evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed tomography angiography in 397 
      patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, gender, CKD, DM, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking status. Additionally, subgroup 
      analyses in each variable were conducted. Our multivariate logistic regression 
      analyses revealed that CKD was significantly associated with the outside-wall 
      calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM was only associated with the 
      inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased the 
      association between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its 
      orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was significantly 
      associated with the calcification at the orifices of the aortic arch branches 
      synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have any significant association with 
      calcification in any of the three vascular beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk 
      of calcification in common with the three different vascular beds. CKD in 
      combination with DM, as well as hypertension in combination with CKD, were key 
      relationships affecting the risk of arterial calcification, especially at the aortic 
      arch and its orifices.

AB  - It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are 
      simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone 
      health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney 
      disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of 
      microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery 
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture of 
      the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography 
      (HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar 
      spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery calcification using 
      multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured in 66 patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of bone turnover, vitamin D 
      status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were assessed. CAC score was found to 
      be <100 in 39% and ≥100 in 61% of patients. The median [95% CI] total CAC score was 
      282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis, significant correlations between CAC and age 
      (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3, p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, 
      p<0.01) were found, and parameters of bone microarchitecture were numerically but 
      not significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100. In multivariate analysis 
      stratifying for gender and correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone 
      volume/total volume (BV/TV) were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores 
      ≥100 (p<0.05 for both). Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone 
      density are associated with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of 
      studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant recipients, 
      and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft 
      prognosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal 
      transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We 
      established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before 
      transplantation. We analyzed the impact of calcification in graft and patient 
      survival, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal 
      function, and mineral metabolism. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) 
      before renal transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical 
      differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass 
      index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to 
      first 2 years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft 
      survival in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In 
      line with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and 
      cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P = 
      .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent predictor 
      for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time of 
      transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after renal 
      transplantation.

TI  - Carotid plaque composition in chronic kidney disease: a retrospective analysis of 
      patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
PG  - 11-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ejvs.2009.09.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Calcified plaques are suggested to represent atherosclerotic lesions 
      with stabilising properties. However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      frequently have calcified plaques but significant higher prevalence of 
      cardiovascular complications. The aim of our study was therefore to analyse the 
      effect of CKD in patients with advanced carotid stenosis (>70%) on plaque 
      composition, lesion stability and risk of rupture. METHODS: We investigated 
      retrospectively, by histology, carotid plaques of patients with high-grade internal 
      carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Comparison of plaque 
      morphology was performed on 41 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml min(-1) (according to the Modification of Diet in 
      Renal Disease formula, MDRD-eGFR) and 56 patients with normal renal function. 
      RESULTS: Patients with CKD had significantly higher percentage of total 
      calcification (17% vs. 7%, p<0.001), unstable and ruptured plaques (83% vs. 52%, 
      p=0.001 and 59% vs. 36%, p=0.039, respectively) compared with patients with normal 
      renal function. By contrast, the content of collagenous fibres was significantly 
      reduced in CKD patients (40% vs. 57%, p=0.011). No significant differences were 
      found for neurological symptoms and soft plaque content. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      demonstrate that CKD significantly affects plaque composition in patients with 
      advanced carotid artery stenosis. Enhanced calcification and reduced collagenous 
      plaque may lead to plaque instability and rupture.

TI  - Assessment of vascular calcification in ESRD patients using spiral CT.
PG  - 1152-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients have increased vascular calcification of the coronary 
      arteries and aorta by electron beam CT scan. The purpose of the present study was to 
      utilize an alternative machine, spiral CT, to assess calcification in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: Two groups of patients with ESRD were 
      evaluated: group 1, those receiving a renal transplant (n=38); and group 2, those 
      remaining on dialysis (n=33). All patients underwent quad-slice spiral CT with 
      retrospective gating to evaluate coronary artery and aorta calcification scores. 
      Both area (Agatston method) and volume calculations were utilized, with 
      retrospective gating in all but 16 subjects. Laboratory tests, medications and 
      clinical characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Using spiral CT, the intra-reader 
      variability for coronary artery calcification (after correction for very low scores) 
      was 0.9% mean / 0% median using the area (Agatston method) and 2.9% mean / 0% median 
      using volume calculations. Group 1 patients were younger, more likely to be 
      Caucasian and on peritoneal dialysis, had lower serum calcium and higher C-reactive 
      protein levels than group 2. In patients without vs those with coronary artery 
      calcification, only longer duration of dialysis (34+/-64 vs 55+/-50 months, P=0.004; 
      r=0.39, P=0.005) and increasing age (39+/-13 vs 54+/-10 years, P<0.001; r=0.29, 
      P=0.039) were associated, whereas only increasing age was associated with aorta 
      calcification. CONCLUSION: In ESRD patients, the factors correlating with coronary 
      calcification were duration of dialysis and advancing age, whereas only age 
      correlated with aorta calcification. Spiral CT offers an alternative technique for 
      the assessment of these changes.

TI  - Outcomes of Patients With a History of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Who Underwent 
      Orbital Atherectomy for Severe Coronary Artery Calcification.
PG  - 359-362
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assess the angiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with a 
      history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery who underwent orbital 
      atherectomy for the treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions. BACKGROUND: 
      The presence of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) increases the complexity 
      of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with worse clinical 
      outcomes. Patients with a history of CABG who undergo PCI often have comorbidities 
      and are at higher risk for ischemic complications. METHODS: Of the 458 patients who 
      underwent orbital atherectomy, 77 patients (17%) had a history of CABG and 381 (83%) 
      did not. The primary endpoint was rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac and 
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE), comprised of cardiac death, myocardial infarction 
      (MI), target-vessel revascularization (TVR), and stroke. RESULTS: The CABG group had 
      a higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, history of PCI, 
      and unstable angina. The primary endpoint was similar in the CABG and non-CABG 
      groups (1% vs 2%; P=.56), as were the individual endpoints of cardiac death (0% vs 
      2%; P=.27), MI (1% vs 1%; P=.85), TVR (0% vs 0%; P>.99), and stroke (0% vs 0%; 
      P=.65). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis were similarly 
      low in both groups. CONCLUSION: Despite a higher-risk baseline profile, patients 
      with a history of CABG had similar angiographic and clinical outcomes compared with 
      patients who had no previous history of CABG. Further studies are needed to clarify 
      the role of orbital atherectomy in these patients.

TI  - Preoperative assessment of computerized tomography angiography to predict success 
      for crossing long Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions using the optical 
      coherence tomography catheter.
PG  - 362-367
LID - 10.1177/1708538117742828 [doi]
AB  - Objectives Optical coherence tomography chronic total occlusion catheter, the Ocelot 
      (Avinger Inc., Redwood City, CA), has been utilized to cross Trans-Atlantic 
      Inter-Society Consensus D lesions. This study evaluated the preoperative 
      computerized tomography angiography of chronic total occlusions in the superficial 
      femoral artery to predict clinical success. Methods We reviewed all patients who 
      underwent lower extremity procedures with the Ocelot catheter from June 2014 to 
      August 2016. Patients who had a preoperative computerized tomography angiography 
      were evaluated. Final outcomes, plaque morphology, lesion length, calcium surface 
      area, lesion location, and patient characteristics were analyzed. Results A total of 
      107 patients underwent lower extremity interventions with the Ocelot catheter. 
      Seventy patients had a preoperative computerized tomography angiography scan prior 
      to lower extremity intervention and 77% (54) had Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society 
      Consensus D lesions that were crossed. Mean age was 62.8 years and 68.6% were male. 
      Mean chronic total occlusion length was 182.7 mm (170.8 mm crossed vs. 222.6 mm 
      uncrossed, p = 0.03). Calcium distribution differed significantly ( p<.01): 
      circumferential (14.8 vs. 12.5%); eccentric (85 vs. 62.5%); and complete calcium 
      occlusion (0 vs. 25%) for lesions that were crossed and uncrossed, respectively. 
      Significant differences ( p<.0001) were found when calcium occlusion was less than 
      50% (87 vs. 31%), 51-75% (9.3 vs. 31.2%), and 76-100% (3.7 vs. 37.5%). Total calcium 
      length in crossed lesion was 51.6 mm, and 92.8 mm in uncrossed lesions ( p = 0.10). 
      No significant differences were noted for patient gender, occlusion location 
      (proximal, middle, and distal superficial femoral artery), and kidney function. 
      Conclusion The Ocelot catheter is an effective method to cross long Trans-Atlantic 
      Inter-Society Consensus D lesions. Superficial femoral artery lesions longer than 17 
      cm and focal plaque morphology, specifically a total cross-sectional area of calcium 
      and a calcium surface area greater than 50% were most predictive of failure to cross 
      Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D superficial femoral artery lesions. 
      Computerized tomography angiography is an effective tool to predict success for 
      crossing chronic total occlusions using optical coherence tomography technology and 
      a critical consideration for patient selection.

PG  - 770-5
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2011.599913 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes mellitus, 
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy are the most 
      commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true 
      visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To 
      date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. 
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: 
      Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy 
      subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice 
      multidetector computed tomography scanner. RESULTS: There were no differences in 
      age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between 
      healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT 
      measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with 
      nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant 
      relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48). 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS 
      in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy 
      subjects.

TI  - Soft tissue calcification in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - Soft tissue calcification is a recognized complication of uremia in adult patients 
      and has been implicated as a cause of ischemic necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and 
      respiratory failure. However, soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in 
      pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an 
      adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, 
      biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following 
      renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 
      1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). 
      Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most 
      frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, 
      coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification 
      was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had 
      small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue 
      calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of 
      vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak 
      calcium x phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were 
      jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest 
      independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was 
      greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and 
      vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium 
      at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not 
      statistically associated with calcinosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Assessment of the relationship between selected cardiovascular risk factors and the 
      indices of intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium score in various 
      stages of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2003-12
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1132-8 [doi]
AB  - Renal diseases pose a growing epidemiological and health problem worldwide. 
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths among patients with chronic 
      kidney disease. Increased risk of atherosclerosis in these patients results from the 
      occurrence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors. The aim of this study 
      was to assess the relationship between selected risk factors for cardiovascular 
      diseases (age, sex, dyslipidemia, hypertension, etc.), intima-media thickness and 
      coronary artery calcium score in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 2, 3 
      and 4. This study included 60 patients with chronic kidney disease divided into 3 
      groups on the basis of disease stage and control group consisting of 20 individuals 
      without diagnosed chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases. Blood analysis 
      and blood pressure measurements were taken. All patients underwent carotid artery 
      ultrasound with the assessment of the intima-media thickness, and heart CT scan in 
      order to assess the index of coronary artery calcification. Logistic regression 
      analysis revealed statistically significant correlation between blood vessels 
      calcification and age--the increase in age by 1 year was associated with the 
      increase in the risk of coronary artery calcification by 6.7 %. The increase in IMT 
      by about 0.1 mm raises the risk of calcification by about 2 %. Second logistic 
      regression model revealed that one-year increase in age was associated with an 
      increase in the risk of intima-media thickening by 6.5 %. Occurrence of hypertension 
      was associated with a ninefold increase in intima-media thickening risk in 
      comparison with patients with normal blood pressure. To sum up, age and hypertension 
      were associated with the growth of IMT in CKD patients, while age and exposure to 
      tobacco smoke were associated with the increase in coronary artery calcium score. 
      The relationship between thickening of IMT and the increase in calcification index 
      in patients was also observed in study group.

TI  - Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed 
      tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0620-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular 
      disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. 
      Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these 
      measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to 
      determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for 
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computed tomography with contrast medium was 
      performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average 
      age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the 
      volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients 
      were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or 
      hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic 
      abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, 
      and hospitalization or death due to heart failure. RESULTS: Patients were followed 
      for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and 
      male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In 
      contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, 
      maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, 
      or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional 
      computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - Accelerated vascular calcification and relative hypoparathyroidism in incident 
      haemodialysis diabetic patients receiving calcium binders.
PG  - 3215-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and low bone turnover with a relatively low 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) often coexist in diabetic patients undergoing 
      haemodialysis. Since calcium salts (CaS) are used extensively as primary phosphate 
      binders and have been associated with progressive vascular calcification, we studied 
      the effects of CaS on coronary arteries and parathyroid activity in incident 
      haemodialysis diabetic patients. METHODS: We measured the change in coronary artery 
      calcium scores (CACS) with sequential electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 64 
      diabetic and 45 non-diabetic patients, randomized to CaS or sevelamer within 90 days 
      of starting haemodialysis. CACS measurements were repeated after 6, 12 and 18 
      months. Serum intact PTH (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus were serially tested. 
      RESULTS: During the study period, serum phosphate was similar in diabetic and 
      non-diabetic patients. Serum calcium levels were similar at baseline (2.3+/-0.25 
      mmol/l for both) and increased significantly with CaS treatment (P<0.05) both in 
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients but not with sevelamer. Diabetic patients treated 
      with CaS showed a significantly greater CACS progression than sevelamer-treated 
      patients (median increase 177 vs 27; P=0.05). During follow-up, diabetic patients 
      receiving CaS were significantly more likely to develop serum iPTH values<16 pmol/l 
      than diabetic patients treated with sevelamer (33% vs 6%, P=0.005) and had a lower 
      mean iPTH level (24+/-16 vs 31+/-14 pmol/l; P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The management of 
      hyperphosphataemia with CaS in haemodialysis diabetic patients is associated with a 
      significantly greater progression of CACS than with sevelamer. These effects are 
      accompanied by iPTH changes suggestive of low bone turnover.

PG  - 2685-90
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased coronary flow reserve (CFR) is a marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction, coronary artery calcification and inflammation, well-known 
      cardiovascular risk factors in haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed 
      to investigate the correlation of coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) with 
      CFR in HD patients. METHODS: Sixty-four end-stage renal failure patients were 
      enrolled in this study (38 males, 26 females). Thirty-nine healthy subjects (22 
      males, 17 females) were included in the control group. Biochemical parameters and 
      acute-phase inflammation marker [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] of 
      patients were recorded before dialysis. The CACS were measured by electron beam 
      computerized tomography method. CFR recordings were performed by trans-thoracic 
      Doppler echocardiography. The relationship between CACS and CFR was evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The mean CACS was 281 +/- 589 and 29 patients had CACS < 10. Patients with 
      CACS > 10 had significantly lower CFR values compared to patients with CACS < 10 
      (1.56 +/- 0.38 vs 1.84 +/- 0.53, P = 0.024). However, there was no difference in 
      hs-CRP values between the groups. CFR was negatively correlated with CACS (r = 
      -0.276, P = 0.030). In multiple stepwise regression analysis, CACS was found to be 
      an independent variable for predicting CFR (P = 0.048). During a follow-up of 18 
      months, 10 patients had experience of cardiovascular events. Patients with CACS > 10 
      had significantly higher event rate [34.5% (10/29) vs 0% (0/24)] compared to those 
      with CACS < 10 (P = 0.001). Patients who developed cardiovascular events had 
      significantly higher mean CACS and lower CFR values than the remaining group (P = 
      0.019 and P = 0.039). All of four patients who died during follow-up were in the CFR 
      < 2 and CACS > 10 groups. CONCLUSIONS: CACS was associated with CFR in HD patients. 
      However, we did not find any association of inflammation with CACS and CFR. This 
      association between CFR and CACS might indicate two different (anatomical and 
      functional) aspects of the common pathophysiology of the arterial system in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Markers of vascular disease do not differ in black and white hemodialysis patients 
      despite a different risk profile.
PG  - 242-9
AB  - Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
      augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an 
      unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the majority 
      of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data are 
      discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross sectional study 
      we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic 
      aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 
      61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans 
      were performed within a week of each other. There was no difference between races in 
      age, systolic blood pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent 
      history of hypertension (100% versus 89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia 
      (30% versus 66%; P<0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 
      pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% 
      versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 
      28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as 
      CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort 
      there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients 
      despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from 
      the general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer 
      vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and 
      others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise 
      the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in 
      patients of different races and with different risk profiles.

      Transplantation.
PG  - 1261-1267
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recipients with type 1 diabetes, we aimed to determine whether 
      long-term normoglycemia achieved by successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney 
      (SPK) transplantation could beneficially affect progression of coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) when compared with transplantation of a kidney-alone from a living 
      donor (LDK). METHODS: In 42 kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts who 
      had received either SPK (n = 25) or LDK (n = 17), we studied angiographic 
      progression of CAD between baseline (pretransplant) and follow-up at 7 years or 
      older. In addition, computed tomography scans for measures of coronary artery 
      calcification and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function 
      were addressed at follow-up. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 10.1 years 
      (interquartile range [IQR], 9.1-11.5) progression of CAD occurred at similar rates 
      (10 of 21 cases in the SPK and 5 of 14 cases in the LDK group; P = 0.49). Median 
      coronary artery calcification scores were high in both groups (1767 [IQR, 321-4035] 
      for SPK and 1045 [IQR, 807-2643] for LDK patients; P = 0.59). Left ventricular 
      systolic function did not differ between the 2 groups. The SPK and LDK recipients 
      were similar in age (41.2 ± 6.9 years vs 40.5 ± 10.3 years; P = 0.80) and diabetes 
      duration at engraftment but with significant different mean HbA1c levels of 5.5 ± 
      0.4% for SPK and 8.3 ± 1.5% for LDK patients (P < 0.001) during follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with both type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, SPK 
      recipients had similar progression of CAD long-term compared with LDK recipients. 
      Calcification of coronary arteries is a prominent feature in both groups long-term 
      posttransplant.

AB  - We assessed the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older living 
      kidney donors and its effect on recipient eGFR and graft histology. A total of 292 
      consecutive living pairs with donor age ≥50 from 2003 to 2013 were identified (mean 
      age 56; range 50-78; F/M: 1.8). Donor AAC was determined by prenephrectomy 
      unenhanced CT. Recipient eGFR and spot urine protein: creatinine ratios (UPCRs) were 
      recorded. A total of 180 recipients had 6-month protocol biopsies. AAC was present 
      in 40.7% of donors, and they were older (58.6 versus 54.7 years old, P < 0.0001) and 
      more likely to be male (77.6% vs. 37.3%, P = 0.004). There was no significant 
      difference in eGFR or spot UPCR up to 36 months in recipients of allografts from 
      donors with versus without AAC. At 6-month biopsy, there was a higher percentage of 
      allografts with vascular fibrous intimal thickening and arteriolar hyaline 
      thickening from donors with versus without AAC (vascular fibrous intimal thickening: 
      38.8% vs. 7.1% and arteriolar hyaline thickening: 35.8% vs. 7.1%; P < 0.001 for 
      both). The presence of donor AAC predicts the presence of vascular disease [vascular 
      fibrous intimal thickening (OR: 7.2; CI:2.9-17.9) and arteriolar hyaline thickening 
      (OR:5.7; CI:2.3-14.1)] in allografts at 6 months. Donor AAC is predictive of renal 
      vascular disease and may help to improve the screening of potential donors and 
      inform post-transplant management.

PG  - 589-594
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00619-w [doi]
AB  - Kidney stone disease is associated with cardiovascular outcomes; it is unclear 
      whether stone composition is associated with differential cardiovascular risk. To 
      analyze such association, we performed a cross-sectional study in which data were 
      collected for patients who underwent at least one stone composition analysis from 
      January 01 2015 to May 30 2018. The original dataset was linked with the imaging 
      database to identify those patients with at least one abdominal CT scan examination 
      during the period of interest. In total, 180 patients were included. The outcome of 
      interest was the presence of any abdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) computed from 
      CT scans. There were 108 (60.0%) patients with AAC. Calcium phosphate content was 
      associated directly with eGFR, inversely with age, and was higher among females. 
      Uric acid content was associated directly with age and inversely with eGFR, was 
      higher among males, patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. After adjustment 
      for age and gender, there was a significant association between calcium phosphate 
      content and AAC (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.56, p = 0.045). No interaction by gender 
      was found between calcium phosphate content and AAC (p = 0.84). In conclusion, we 
      demonstrated a significant direct association of AAC and the amount of calcium 
      phosphate was found, suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk. Our study suggests 
      that some subtypes of kidney stone disease deserve a closer cardiovascular risk 
      assessment.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). We examined the cross-sectional association between novel risk 
      factors and coronary artery calcium (CAC) measured using electron beam computed 
      tomography or multidetector computed tomography among 2,018 patients with CKD. Using 
      the total Agatston scores, the participants were classified as having no (0), 
      moderate (>0-100), or high (>100) CAC. After adjustment for age, gender, race, study 
      sites, cigarette smoking, previous cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and 
      diabetes, the use of lipid-lowering drugs, body mass index, waist circumference, and 
      cystatin C, several novel risk factors were significantly associated with high CAC. 
      For example, the odds ratios of high CAC associated with 1 SD greater level of risk 
      factors were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.38) for serum calcium, 1.21 
      (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.41) for serum phosphate, 0.83 (95% confidence 
      interval 0.71 to 0.97) for log (total parathyroid hormone), 1.21 (95% confidence 
      interval 1.03 to 1.43) for log (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance), 
      and 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.45) for hemoglobin A1c. Additionally, 
      the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 1 SD greater level of cystatin C was 1.31 
      (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.50). Serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein, 
      interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and homocysteine were not statistically 
      significantly associated with high CAC. In conclusion, these data indicate that 
      abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, insulin resistance, and declining kidney 
      function are associated with the prevalence of high CAC, independent of the 
      traditional risk factors in patients with CKD. Additional studies are warranted to 
      examine the causal effect of these risk factors on CAC in patients with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronary artery calcium score is a widely known independent 
      predictor of cardiac events. Tibial artery calcification had been reported as an 
      amputation risk, but the femoropopliteal artery calcium score is rarely known. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using the data collected from the 
      patients who underwent endovascular treatment for the femoropopliteal artery between 
      January 2010 and December 2017. The femoropopliteal artery calcium scores on 
      preprocedural computed tomography were calculated according to the Agatston 
      definition. The mean value of total of femoropopliteal artery calcium scores was 
      used to divide the scores into two groups. The prognostic value of the calcium score 
      was analyzed based on primary patency, clinically driven target lesion 
      revascularization, major amputation, and all-cause death. RESULTS: In total, 132 
      consecutive limbs that underwent successful endovascular intervention were analyzed 
      in this study; 44 and 88 limbs were assigned to the high and low calcium score 
      groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups 
      in terms of patient and lesion characteristics, except for chronic kidney disease 
      (7% vs. 25%, P < 0.01), hemodialysis (80% vs. 25%, P < 0.01), and coronary artery 
      disease (73% vs. 53%, P = 0.03). Compared with the low calcium score group, the high 
      calcium score group had a significantly higher rate of loss of primary patency and 
      clinically driven target lesion revascularization at one year, based on the 
      Kaplan-Meier curve (55% vs. 81%, 44% vs. 8%, both P < 0.01). There were no 
      significant differences between the two groups in terms of major amputation and 
      death. Multivariate analysis revealed that hemodialysis [hazard ratio (HR): 1.9; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 1.01-5.28; P = 0.04] runoff grade 0 (HR: 2.9; 95% CI: 
      1.02-10.9; P = 0.04), lesion length > 200 mm (HR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.1-13.7; P = 0.03), 
      and calcium score per 100 increase (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02-1.08; P < 0.01) were 
      predictors of clinically driven target lesion revascularization. As per receiver 
      operating characteristic analysis, the best cutoff value of target lesion calcium 
      score for target lesion revascularization was 206. CONCLUSIONS: A high 
      femoropopliteal artery calcium score might increase loss of patency and the risk for 
      clinically driven target lesion revascularization.

TI  - Detection of coronary and peripheral artery calcification in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 3208-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent of 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished to 
      determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would assist in 
      identifying patients positive for CAC. METHODS: CAC was detected by multi-slice 
      computed tomography and PAC was detected by plain foot radiography. Study population 
      was 112 patients, 54 with diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart 
      disease. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5% with and without diabetes, 
      respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more vessels 
      affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same risk for CAC. 
      In patients with diabetes, age was the unique explanatory variable for detecting the 
      presence of CAC, while age and smoking history predicted severity. In patients 
      without diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the presence of CAC, while parathyroid 
      hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC was 63 and 12% in subjects with and 
      without diabetes. PAC detected by foot radiography was not an adequate 
      alternative-screening marker for identifying patients with CAC. CONCLUSIONS: CAC is 
      common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in men and women with diabetes.

TI  - Modeling the implications of changes in vascular calcification in patients on 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 1532-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of 
      coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based 
      phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular 
      events, risk equations are needed. METHODS: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis 
      treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to 
      study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 
      years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified 
      using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography 
      (EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all 
      patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional 
      hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of 
      calcification, controlling for other characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion 
      was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered 
      an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic 
      blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of 
      cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a 
      calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a 
      score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000. CONCLUSION: In the absence 
      of long-term follow-up studies, these equations permit quantification of the 
      expected long-term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders 
      on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these 
      equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.

TI  - Calcification of coronary intima and media: immunohistochemistry, backscatter 
      imaging, and x-ray analysis in renal and nonrenal patients.
PG  - 121-34
AB  - Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In patients with 
      chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of coronary calcification are 
      increased. It has remained uncertain whether it is the intima of the coronaries or 
      the media that is calcified and whether the morphologic details of calcified plaques 
      differ between renal and nonrenal patients. Autopsy samples of coronaries were 
      obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and gender-matched nonuremic 
      patients. Specimens were examined using light and electron microscopy, 
      immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray analysis. In coronaries, 
      calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the intima area in renal versus 
      nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/- 11.9%) but occupied a significantly 
      higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of 
      the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was 
      significantly more intensive around coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal 
      patients. The non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients showed minimal staining 
      for fetuin, but fetuin staining was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, 
      more pronounced deposition of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal 
      patients, and glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in 
      renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more intense in 
      the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal compared with 
      nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal patients is 
      suggested by more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers of 
      inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are risk factors for kidney function decline in predialysis 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 125 stage 
      3 to 5 predialysis CKD patients. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: CKD patients receiving care 
      in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. METHODS: BMI, CAC, and kidney function were measured 
      at baseline. CAC was measured by multislice computed tomography scan. Kidney 
      function was determined by the 4-variable reexpressed Modification of Diet in Renal 
      Disease Study equation. At study end, kidney function decline among patients was 
      compared according to baseline BMI and CAC. MAIN OUTCOME: Kidney function decline 
      was defined as a 1-year decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 
      5%. RESULTS: Individuals with a decline in eGFR of ≥ 5% at 1 year had higher 
      baseline BMI (33.5 ± 8.3 vs. 28.4 ± 4.9 kg/m(2); P = .0001) and higher baseline 
      median CAC scores (239 vs. 25 Agatston units; P = .01) compared with subjects 
      without such a decline. BMI (r = 0.35; P < .0001) and logarithmically transformed 
      CAC score (r = 0.22; P = .01) correlated with an eGFR decline of ≥ 5%. Both crude 
      and adjusted logistic regression analyses showed escalating CAC (with CAC reported 
      in quintiles and CAC score = 0 Agatston unit as the reference group) was associated 
      with an increased risk of eGFR decline of ≥ 5%. CONCLUSIONS: CAC and BMI were 
      associated with kidney function decline over 1 year. The risk of kidney function 
      decline was greater in those with increasing burden of CAC, which remained robust in 
      the adjusted analysis accounting for the risk factors for CKD progression. Larger 
      studies will be required for independent validation of the associations of BMI, CAC, 
      and kidney function decline, and to investigate whether obesity and CAC treatment 
      strategies are efficacious in attenuating kidney function decline in predialysis CKD 
      patients.

LID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic peri-aortic fat tissue (PFT) and epicardial adipose tissue 
      (EAT) are metabolically active visceral fat deposits surrounding the thoracic aorta 
      and the heart, respectively. Various studies have demonstrated a positive predictive 
      value of both PFT and EAT for coronary artery disease in the general population. In 
      the present study, we aimed to investigate PFT thickness and the independent 
      predictors of PFT in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. ♢ METHODS: Our 
      cross-sectional study enrolled 35 PD patients (10 women, 25 men) and 30 
      age-and-sex-matched healthy subjects (15 women, 15 men). We measured PFT, thoracic 
      artery calcification (TAC), EAT, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) by 
      electrocardiogram-gated 64-multi-detector computed tomography. ♢ RESULTS: The 
      measured PFT, EAT, CAC, and TAC were significantly higher in the PD group than in 
      the healthy subjects (p < 0.05 each). In the PD group, PFT and TAC were 
      significantly correlated (r = 0.33, p = 0.007). Also, PFT measurements were 
      positively correlated with EAT and total CAC in the PD and the control group alike 
      (r = 0.58, p = 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.01 respectively). A stepwise linear 
      regression analysis revealed that age, duration of hypertension, and being a PD 
      patient were independent predictors of PFT. ♢ CONCLUSIONS: Measured PFT was higher 
      in PD patients than in healthy subjects and, in the PD population, was also shown to 
      be related to calcification scores and EAT.

TI  - Calcification of the internal pudendal artery and development of erectile 
      dysfunction in adenine-induced chronic kidney disease: a sentinel of systemic 
      vascular changes.
PG  - 2449-65
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12648 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), erectile dysfunction (ED), and 
      cardiovascular disease share common vascular etiologies and risk factors. AIM: Using 
      a rat model, this is the first study to characterize the consequences of CKD in the 
      onset and development of ED associated with differential regional vascular 
      calcification and circulatory changes. METHODS: Stable CKD was generated at 3 weeks 
      in male Sprague-Dawley rats given dietary adenine and progressed until 7 weeks. 
      Mineral content and morphometry were assessed in the internal pudendal arteries 
      (IPAs), thoracic aorta, and carotid artery. Endothelial function was determined via 
      changes in serum von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelium-dependent relaxation of 
      the thoracic aorta. RESULTS: In severe CKD rats, calcium and phosphate content in 
      all arteries increased, and pulse wave velocity was elevated. Distal IPA segments, 
      in particular, were the first to calcify, but penile tissue per se did not. CKD rats 
      had endothelial dysfunction, as indicated by a decrease in acetylcholine-mediated 
      relaxation (∼40%) and an increase in serum VWF (∼40%), as well as increased lumen 
      diameter (20%) of the distal IPA. Erectile function, assessed using a centrally 
      acting dopaminergic agent, was significantly impaired by 7 weeks (∼40%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In CKD, the distal IPA appears to be more susceptible to vascular 
      dysfunction and calcification. Additionally, the onset of ED may be an important 
      sentinel of impending systemic vascular disease. To confirm this concept, future 
      experimental and clinical studies will need to examine a range of vessel types and 
      the use of supplementary methods to assess erectile function.

TI  - Sequence variation in vitamin K epoxide reductase gene is associated with survival 
      and progressive coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1591-6

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sequence variations in the gene(s) encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase 
      complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), the enzyme target of warfarin, have been associated with 
      increased cardiovascular disease in the general population. Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) is a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney 
      disease. We tested the hypothesis that the VKORC1 rs8050894 CC genotype would be 
      associated with mortality and progression of CAC ≤ 4 years. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 
      This study is an observational, prospective study of 167 individuals with stages 3 
      to 5 chronic kidney disease. Survival ≤ 4 years was assessed in all participants, 
      and CAC progression was measured in a subset of 86 patients. Participants with the 
      CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had higher baseline CAC scores (median score, 112 versus 
      299; P=0.036). Of those 86 patients who had a 4-year CAC score, those with the CG/GG 
      genotype had an increased risk of progressive CAC (adjusted for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension) compared with 
      those with the CC genotype. Four-year mortality risk was 4 times higher for 
      individuals with the CG/GG genotypes compared with individuals with the CC genotype 
      (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.5; P=0.02), adjusted for age, sex, 
      diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline CAC, and 
      hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had a higher 
      risk of CAC progression and a poorer survival. These data provide new perspectives 
      on the potential extrahepatic role of VKORC1 in individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease.

TI  - Association of coronary artery calcium score and vascular dysfunction in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 216-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2012.00739.x [doi]
AB  - Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of 
      digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with the 
      severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We hypothesized that 
      in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score have a 
      gradient association that follows that of subjects without kidney disease. We 
      examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group of long-term 
      hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart. Area under the 
      curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index of vascular 
      function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia test. Coronary 
      calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography or multidetector 
      computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited hemodialysis patients 
      (age: 58 ± 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and gender-matched controls. In 
      hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was significantly worse (114 ± 72 vs. 
      143 ± 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was higher (525 ± 425 vs. 240 ± 332, P < 0.001). 
      Hemodialysis patients were 14 times more likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared 
      with controls. After adjustment for known confounders, the relative risk for case 
      vs. control for each standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence 
      interval: 1.12-1.93, P = 0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM 
      technology is incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in 
      whom both measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The 
      DTM technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify 
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Aortic calcification and femoral bone density are independently associated with left 
      ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e39241

LID - e39241
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in chronic 
      kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is 
      unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone 
      density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic 
      kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, 
      mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic 
      calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 
      48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 
      1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left 
      ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic 
      calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 
      vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 
      ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic 
      calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean 
      femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 
      0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic 
      calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% 
      of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral 
      Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with 
      increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that 
      underlies these relationships is warranted.

AB  - PURPOSE: Arterial calcifications in the lower extremity, chest, and cardiac vessels 
      have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relation between 
      arterial calcifications observed on routine hand and upper-extremity radiographs and 
      atherosclerosis has not been determined. This study examined whether arterial 
      calcifications found on hand radiographs are associated with CAD. METHODS: A record 
      review from a single institution identified 345 patients with both hand radiographs 
      and CAD screening with cardiac stress testing or coronary angiography. Patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or incomplete hand films were 
      excluded. We reviewed x-rays for findings of arterial calcifications. Cardiac 
      testing results were used to establish a baseline diagnosis of CAD. We made group 
      comparisons and employed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the 
      association between upper-extremity calcification and CAD. RESULTS: A total of 210 
      patients met inclusion criteria: 155 with CAD and 55 without it. Mean age was 72 
      years, body mass index was 28.8, and 54% were male. Patients had comorbidities of 
      hypertension (91%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes (39%), cerebrovascular accident 
      (9%), and a history of tobacco use (53%). Of 155 CAD patients, 67 had arterial 
      calcifications on hand radiographs (43%), compared with 6 of 55 without it (11%). In 
      a multivariable model controlling for sex, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, the 
      presence of arterial calcifications on hand plain films indicated a 6.2-fold 
      increased odds of CAD. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate that arterial 
      calcifications on hand radiographs are independently associated with CAD. This may 
      represent an opportunity to the treating physician as a point of referral or 
      investigation for underlying or occult CAD. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Prevalence III.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased incidence of 
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and posttransplant diabetes 
      mellitus that promote the development of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The 
      aim of the current study was to elucidate the extent of CAC and its risk factors 
      among KT patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the 
      severity of CAC in our KT patients. Multidetector computed tomography was performed 
      to assess the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were further stratified 
      according to the CACS as: group 1: 0-10, group 2: 11-100, group 3: 101-300, group 4: 
      301-1000, and group 5: >1000. Clinical as well as demographic data were compared 
      among groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors that 
      were associated with CAC. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were enrolled in the 
      study. The mean age was 53.5 ± 11.8 years and duration of follow-up post-KT was 11.2 
      ± 5.9 years. The distribution of CACS in groups 1 through 5 was: 41.4%, 20.2%, 
      11.1%, 15.2%, and 12.1%, respectively. A significantly higher CACS was found in 
      males, patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus, older current age, older age 
      at KT, hypertension, higher body weight, higher fasting plasma sugar level and lower 
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Twenty-nine (29.3%) patients fulfilled 
      criteria for metabolic syndrome (MS). The CACS was significantly higher in patients 
      with MS than in those without MS. An incremental CACS was found to be correlated 
      with increasing number of MS components (P = .003). Multivariate linear regression 
      revealed that female gender, current age, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were 
      associated with CAC. CONCLUSION: KT was associated with high CACS in a significant 
      proportion of patients with long-term follow-up. Several risk factors were 
      identified. Some of them were potentially treatable and should be taken into 
      consideration in the management of KT recipients.

TI  - Cardiac valvular calcification as a marker of atherosclerosis and arterial 
      calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk for 
      tissue calcifications as a result of deranged mineral metabolism. We tested the 
      hypothesis that valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: Echocardiography was performed in 92 patients undergoing 
      peritoneal dialysis with no background atherosclerotic vascular complications to 
      detect valvular calcification. We used B-mode ultrasonography to determine carotid 
      artery intima-media thickness and the presence of plaque and calcification. RESULTS: 
      Compared with patients without valvular calcification (n=66), those with valvular 
      calcification (n=26) had higher C-reactive protein levels (P=.01) and greater mean 
      +/- SE carotid intima-media thickness (1.12 +/- 0.06 vs 0.88 +/- 0.04 mm; P=.003). 
      Carotid artery calcification was present unilaterally and bilaterally in 4 patients 
      (15%) and 17 patients (65%) with valvular calcification vs 11 (17%) and 14 (21%) 
      without, respectively (P<.001). Carotid artery plaque was present unilaterally and 
      bilaterally in 11 patients (12%) and 16 patients (65%) with valvular calcification 
      vs 3 (17%) and 17 (24%) without, respectively (P=.001). Using multiple logistic 
      regression analysis, every 1-mm increase in carotid intima-media thickness was 
      independently associated with a 6.51-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.58-26.73; 
      P=.009) increased risk of valvular calcification, and calcification and plaque in 
      the carotid arteries were associated with a 7.18-fold (95% confidence interval, 
      2.39-21.51; P<.001) and a 5.00-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.77-14.13; P=.002) 
      increased risk of valvular calcification, respectively. CONCLUSION: The associations 
      among valvular calcification, inflammation, carotid atherosclerosis, and arterial 
      calcification suggest that valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis and 
      arterial calcification in patients with ESRD.

TI  - Evaluation of aortic arch calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) is related to 
      cardiovascular (CV) disease. Vascular calcifications are common findings in dialysis 
      patients; therefore, we carried out a retrospective study evaluating which risk 
      factors are associated to AAC in stable hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 
      Standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs, performed the day after the midweek 
      HD session in 132 patients (mean age 65 +/- 12 yrs) who had been on renal 
      replacement therapy (RRT) for 33 months (range 1-471), were analyzed. Cardiothoracic 
      ratio (CTR) was also calculated. RESULTS: AAC was detected in 51% of patients. They 
      were older (68 +/- 8 vs. 62 +/- 14 yrs; p = 0.003), were on RRT for longer (51 
      (range 2-471) vs. 22 (range 1-195) months; p = 0.0001), had greater CTR (54 (32-71) 
      vs. 50% (40-65); p = 0.034) and higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease 
      (PVD) (40 vs. 17%; p = 0.049), whilst body weight was lower (62 +/- 14 vs. 68 +/- 14 
      kg; p = 0.04) than those without AAC. On the contrary, sex, diabetes frequency, 
      smoking habit, history of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia, cerebrovascular and 
      ischemic heart disease (IHD), blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive therapy, 
      lipids, albumin, degree of anemia, calcium, phosphate and their product were no 
      different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds 
      ratio (OR) 1.069 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.11; p = 0.003), length of 
      time on RRT (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.0002), calcium-phosphate product (OR 
      1.03 95% CI 1.007-1.07; p = 0.016), systolic BP (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.005-1.06; p = 
      0.02) and PVD (OR 3.08 95% CI 1.17-8.06; p = 0.02) were independently associated to 
      AAC. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AAC is related to atherosclerosis and to renal 
      failure-related CV risk factors. A careful evaluation of a frequently performed 
      investigation is useful in CV disease risk stratification in HD patients.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and progression of aortic arch 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the 
      progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF)-23. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD 
      patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a 
      score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
      subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
      assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors 
      (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis duration in regressors 
      (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors (19.5±7.0 years) and 
      progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors 
      (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in non-progressors 
      (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple 
      regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum 
      levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (β 
      value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of 
      ΔAoACS. CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
      associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
      enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Coronary-artery calcification in young adults with end-stage renal disease who are 
      undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 1478-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is common in older adults with end-stage renal 
      disease who are undergoing regular dialysis, but little is known about the 
      prevalence and extent of cardiovascular disease in children and young adults with 
      end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We used electron-beam computed tomography (CT) to 
      screen for coronary-artery calcification in 39 young patients with end-stage renal 
      disease who were undergoing dialysis (mean [+/-SD] age, 19+/-7 years; range, 7 to 
      30) and 60 normal subjects 20 to 30 years of age. In those with evidence of 
      calcification on CT scanning, we determined its extent. The results were correlated 
      with the patients' clinical characteristics, serum calcium and phosphorus 
      concentrations, and other biochemical variables. RESULTS: None of the 23 patients 
      who were younger than 20 years of age had evidence of coronary-artery calcification, 
      but it was present in 14 of the 16 patients who were 20 to 30 years old. Among those 
      with calcification, the mean calcification score was 1157+/-1996, and the median 
      score was 297. By contrast, only 3 of the 60 normal subjects had calcification. As 
      compared with the patients without coronary-artery calcification, those with 
      calcification were older (26+/-3 vs. 15+/-5 years, P<0.001) and had been undergoing 
      dialysis for a longer period (14+/-5 vs. 4+/-4 years, P< 0.001). The mean serum 
      phosphorus concentration, the mean calcium-phosphorus ion product in serum, and the 
      daily intake of calcium were higher among the patients with coronary-artery 
      calcification. Among 10 patients with calcification who underwent follow-up CT 
      scanning, the calcification score nearly doubled (from 125+/-104 to 249+/-216, 
      P=0.02) over a mean period of 20+/-3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary-artery 
      calcification is common and progressive in young adults with end-stage renal disease 
      who are undergoing dialysis.

AB  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is thought to be implicated in the development of 
      arterial stiffness and vascular calcification. As a Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor, 
      it is interesting to investigate whether sclerostin or dickkopf-1 (DKK1) level is 
      correlated with arterial stiffness in renal transplant (RT) recipients. Fasting 
      blood samples were obtained for biochemical data, sclerostin, DKK1, and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) determinations. In this study, we applied automatic pulse wave 
      analyzer (VaSera VS-1000) to measure brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and either 
      sides of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity value, which greater than 14.0 m/s was 
      determined as high arterial stiffness. Among 68 RT recipients, 30 patients (44.1%) 
      were in the high arterial stiffness group. Compared with patients in the low 
      arterial stiffness group, patients in the high arterial stiffness group had higher 
      prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.002), diabetes (P < 0.001), metabolic syndrome 
      (P = 0.025), longer posttransplant duration (P = 0.005), higher systolic blood 
      pressure (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.018), and higher fasting 
      glucose (P = 0.004), total cholesterol (P = 0.042), blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.020), 
      phosphorus (P = 0.042), and sclerostin levels (P = 0.001). According to our 
      multivariable forward stepwise linear regression analysis, age (β = 0.272, 
      P = 0.014), phosphorus (β = 0.308, P = 0.007), and logarithmically-transformed OPG 
      (log-OPG; β = 0.222, P = 0.046) were positively associated with sclerostin levels, 
      and multivariate logistic regression analysis, sclerostin (odds ratio 1.052, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.007-1.099, P = 0.024), and posttransplant duration (odds ratio 
      1.024, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.045, P = 0.019) were the independent 
      predictors of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients. In this study, serum 
      sclerostin level, but not DKK1, was proved to be involved in the pathogenetic 
      process of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a strong prognostic marker of mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients and has been associated with bone metabolism disorders in this population. 
      In earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular calcification also has 
      been documented. This study evaluated the association between coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) and bone histomorphometric parameters in CKD predialysis 
      patients assessed by multislice coronary tomography and by undecalcified bone 
      biopsy. CAC was detected in 33 (66%) patients, and their median calcium score was 
      89.7 (0.4-2299.3 AU). The most frequent bone histologic alterations observed 
      included low trabecular bone volume, increased eroded and osteoclast surfaces, and 
      low bone-formation rate (BFR/BS). Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted 
      for age, sex, and diabetes, showed that BFR/BS was independently associated with the 
      presence of coronary calcification [p = .009; odd ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.036-0.619]. This study showed a high prevalence of CAC in 
      asymptomatic predialysis CKD patients. Also, there was an independent association of 
      low bone formation and CAC in this population. In conclusion, our results provide 
      evidence that low bone-formation rate constitutes another nontraditional risk factor 
      for cardiovascular disease in CKD patients.

TI  - A low fractional excretion of Phosphate/Fgf23 ratio is associated with severe 
      abdominal Aortic calcification in stage 3 and 4 kidney disease patients.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution 
      to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4. 
      METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were 
      studied in 178 patients. RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated 
      positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and 
      also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). 
      Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with 
      reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients 
      with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in 
      patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic 
      response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis 
      confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with 
      AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the 
      chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI 
      remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly 
      increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 
      associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

TI  - Progressive vascular calcification over 2 years is associated with arterial 
      stiffening and increased mortality in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1241-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an 
      important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
      cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
      calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 
      134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial 
      femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave 
      velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
      baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. 
      Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients 
      with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The 
      hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who 
      were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
      calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta 
      blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated 
      with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 
      patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in 
      calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk 
      factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease 
      and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification 
      over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness 
      and mortality.

TI  - The natural history of coronary calcification progression in a cohort of nocturnal 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with a markedly increased 
      cardiac calcification burden, as reflected by computed tomography scans of the 
      heart. Nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) is a novel form of renal replacement therapy 
      which has multiple physiologic effects that may affect vascular calcification, 
      including improvements in phosphate and uraemia control. The objective of the 
      present study is the determination of the natural history of coronary calcification 
      progression in patients converted to NHD, and the examination of the relationships 
      between calcification risk factors and calcification progression in these patients. 
      METHODS: Thirty-eight ESRD patients were converted to NHD, and included in our 
      observational cohort study. Coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) were 
      documented at baseline and post-conversion (mean interscan duration 16+/-1 months). 
      Other variables of interest included age, dialysis vintage, Framingham risk profile, 
      phosphate binder and vitamin D usage, and plasma levels of calcium, phosphate and 
      parathyroid hormone. RESULTS: Our cohort was stratified according to baseline 
      calcification burden (minimal calcification: CACS < or = 10 vs significant 
      calcification: CACS > 10). Twenty-four patients had baseline CACS < or = 10. These 
      patients demonstrated no change in coronary calcification after 1 year of NHD (from 
      0.7+/-0.5 to 6+/-3, P = 0.1). Fourteen patients had higher initial CACS at baseline 
      (1874+/-696), and demonstrated a non-significant 9% increase over 1 year to 
      2038+/-740 (P = 0.1). Plasma phosphate and calcium x phosphate product were 
      significantly reduced, as were calcium-based phosphate binder and antihypertensive 
      usage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to document CACS progression in a cohort 
      of NHD patients. Further analysis of the effect of NHD on the physiology of 
      cardiovascular calcification is required.

TI  - Influence of biochemical alterations on arterial stiffness in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - The incremental elastic modulus of the common carotid and radial arteries is 
      increased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), independently of blood 
      pressure, wall stress, and the presence of atherosclerotic alterations. Whether 
      biochemical factors may be involved in the arterial changes and related to renal 
      dysfunction remain largely ignored. To assess this question, we measured aortic 
      (carotid-femoral), upper-limb (carotid-radial), and lower-limb (femoral-tibial) 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 74 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis in comparison 
      with 57 control subjects similar in age, sex ratio, and mean blood pressure. We 
      evaluated arterial blood pressure by sphygmomanometry, aortic calcifications and 
      cardiac mass by echography, and routine biochemical parameters, total plasma 
      homocysteine, and plasma endothelin levels by standard techniques. In the population 
      of patients with ESRD, on the basis of multiple stepwise regression analysis, aortic 
      PWV was positively and independently correlated with systolic blood pressure 
      (P<.0001), age (P<.0001), prevalence of aortic calcification (P=.0004), and the 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P=.0043). Upper-limb PWV was influenced exclusively 
      by mean blood pressure (P<.0001). Lower-limb PWV was positively and independently 
      correlated with plasma total homocysteine (P=.0004) and plasma endothelin (P=.0187) 
      only. At any vascular site, PWV was not independently correlated with tobacco 
      consumption; plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, or hemoglobin; 
      body mass index; or the presence of bilateral nephrectomy. Finally, plasma 
      homocysteine was independently correlated with cardiac mass (P=.0022). This study 
      provides evidence that in ESRD patients, the stiffness of the arterial wall and 
      cardiac mass are strongly influenced by biochemical factors related to the kidney 
      alterations and are independent of age and blood pressure level. Increased plasma 
      endothelin and homocysteine may be specifically involved in the vascular damage of 
      lower limbs.

TI  - Impact of renal function on coronary plaque morphology and morphometry in patients 
      with chronic renal insufficiency as determined by intravascular ultrasound 
      volumetric analysis.
PG  - 892-6
AB  - The aim of the present study was to use intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) to 
      assess plaque morphology and morphometry in patients with varying degrees of chronic 
      renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis 
      replacement. Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death for patients with 
      chronic renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with ESRD. The impact of 
      several degrees of renal insufficiency (including ESRD) on coronary plaque 
      characteristics has not been determined. A total of 142 patients who underwent IVUS 
      imaging of a de novo native coronary artery stenosis before percutaneous 
      intervention were matched for age, gender, and diabetes and were grouped according 
      to calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl): CrCl >70 ml/min (n = 39); CrCl 50 to 69 
      ml/min (n = 41); CrCl <50 ml/min, (n = 37), and ESRD (n = 25). Standard clinical, 
      angiographic, and IVUS parameters were measured. The ESRD group had more 
      African-American (p = 0.002) and hypertensive (p = 0.002) patients. No significant 
      difference was found in any of the IVUS measurements among patients with CrCl >70, 
      50 to 69, and <50 ml/min: reference and lesion site arterial, lumen, and plaque 
      areas and volumes, and arterial calcium (p = NS for all comparisons). Conversely, 
      patients with ESRD had larger reference segment arterial and lumen areas and 
      volumes; larger lesion site arterial, lumen, and plaque areas; and larger arcs of 
      calcium (p <0.05 for all post hoc comparisons between patients with ESRD and 
      patients with CrCl >70, 50 to 69, and <50 ml/min). Thus, chronic renal insufficiency 
      in the absence of dialysis is not associated with increased reference segment or 
      lesion site plaque burden and calcium. However, the transition to the need for 
      dialysis is associated with progressive calcific atherosclerosis (larger lesion 
      plaque area and calcium).

TI  - ORBIT II sub-analysis: Impact of impaired renal function following treatment of 
      severely calcified coronary lesions with the Orbital Atherectomy System.
PG  - 841-848
LID - 10.1002/ccd.26778 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the coronary Orbital 
      Atherectomy System (OAS) to prepare severely calcified lesions for stent deployment 
      in patients grouped by renal function. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI) of severely calcified lesions is associated with increased rates 
      of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction (MI), 
      and target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared with PCI of non-calcified 
      vessels. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for MACE 
      after PCI. The impact of CKD on coronary orbital atherectomy treatment has not been 
      well characterized. METHODS: ORBIT II was a prospective, multicenter trial in the 
      U.S., which enrolled 443 patients with severely calcified coronary lesions. The MACE 
      rate was defined as a composite of cardiac death, MI, and target vessel 
      revascularization. RESULTS: Of the 441 patients enrolled with known estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at baseline, 333 (75.5%) patients had 
      eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 108 patients had eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) . The 
      mean eGFR at baseline in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2) groups was 65.0 ± 0.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 109.1 ± 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , 
      respectively. Freedom from MACE was lower in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) group at 
      30 days (87.4% vs. 96.3%, P = 0.02) and 1-year (80.6% vs. 90.7%, P = 0.02). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with renal impairment had a higher MACE rate through one year 
      follow-up due to a higher rate of periprocedural MI. Interestingly, the rates of 
      cardiac death and revascularization through 1-year were similar in patients with 
      eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) . Future studies are 
      needed to identify the ideal revascularization strategy for patients with renal 
      impairment and severely calcified coronary lesions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium score: 
      comparison between transplantation and dialysis.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent 
      ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences 
      between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity 
      of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately 
      in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, 
      divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; 
      previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 
      mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 
      5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by 
      cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of 
      divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) 
      and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary 
      calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three 
      calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with 
      age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 
      0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a 
      correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other 
      markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression 
      analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and 
      C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most 
      predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age 
      and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
      condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as 
      compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition 
      proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower 
      prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating 
      role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary 
      calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value 
      to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular 
      lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

TI  - Pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure: role of parathyroid 
      hormone and pulmonary artery calcifications.
PG  - 2093-7
AB  - RATIONALE: The aim of this work was to study the association of pulmonary 
      hypertension (PH) with pulmonary artery calcifications (PACs) and 
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) receiving regular 
      hemodialysis. BACKGROUND: Scarce data are available regarding the prevalence and the 
      predictors of PH in patients with CRF. Abnormal (99m)Tc diphosphonate lung uptake 
      was reported in these patients, suggesting a role of PACs. METHODS: We studied 51 
      patients (28 men and 23 women) with end-stage renal disease, who were receiving 
      regular hemodialysis. Patients underwent two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiographic 
      imaging. Laboratory investigations included BUN, serum creatinine, calcium, 
      phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and intact molecule parathormone. PH was defined 
      as pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mm Hg as determined by Doppler 
      echocardiographic evaluation. RESULTS: PH was detected in 15 patients (29%). Women 
      had a higher prevalence of PH (48% vs 14%, p = 0.01). There was no significant 
      differences between patients with PH and those without PH with regards to age, 
      duration of dialysis, serum calcium (9.6 +/- 2 mg/dL vs 10 +/- 2 mg/dL), phosphorus 
      (6 +/- 1.4 mg/L vs 6.2 +/- 1.9 mg/L), alkaline phosphatase (609 +/- 768 U/L vs 473 
      +/- 574 U/L), parathyroid hormone (PTH) [420 +/- 512 pg/mL vs 354 +/- 519 pg/mL] or 
      the prevalence of an abnormal (99m)Tc diphosphate lung scan result (60% vs 73%, 
      respectively [+/- SD]). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 29% of patients 
      with CRF receiving regular hemodialysis have PH. The presence of PH was not related 
      to the level of PTH or the severity of other metabolic abnormalities. There was no 
      relation between PH and the presence or the severity of PAC. PH is detected more 
      frequently in women. This study does not support a role of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism and subsequent PAC as the etiology of PH in patients with CRF.

TI  - Bone fracture risk factors in prevalent hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 205-212
LID - 10.1007/s00774-019-01041-9 [doi]
AB  - Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of fractures in a 
      cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with possible risk 
      factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 patients, since they started 
      HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters as well 
      as vascular calcifications (VC) were evaluated. Fifty-seven episodes of fracture 
      were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months (incidence rate of 31 per 1000 
      person-years). Age (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.02), 
      and higher VC score (p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of 
      fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p = 0.03) was associated with decreased 
      risk. A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with 
      higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) (p = 0.01) and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either < 300 pg/mL (p = 0.02) or > 800 pg/mL 
      (p < 0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. In conclusion, bone fracture incidence in 
      HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, lower serum 
      albumin, and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high 
      iPTH levels or increased bALP also had a higher fracture risk. Therapy with active 
      vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and 
      management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.

TI  - Cardiac calcification in adult hemodialysis patients. A link between end-stage renal 
      disease and cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 695-701
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of 
      calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves in 
      adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. 
      BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic heart 
      disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience accelerated 
      vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of mineral metabolism. 
      Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. 
      Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as measured by electron-beam 
      tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population. METHODS: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis patients who 
      received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. We 
      compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular 
      disease and determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular 
      calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional odds logistic 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 
      (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of 
      obstructive coronary artery disease in the general population. The CA calcium scores 
      were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and 
      angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the 
      prevalence of claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of 
      coronary calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, 
      diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and 
      phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density 
      lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not 
      significantly related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage was 
      significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly associated with 
      ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral 
      metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification risk.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque identification 
      using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of 
      atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might 
      be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured 
      using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode 
      Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 
      63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are 
      on HD thrice a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing 
      tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, 
      P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than 
      patients free of plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant 
      correlation was recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In 
      multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant 
      independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify 
      whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for 
      atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing radial 
      artery macrocalcification (Mönckeberg type of arteriosclerosis) on patency rates of 
      radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs) in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this observational prospective study, the 
      long-term patency rates (primary outcome measures) of RCFs in ESRD diabetics who had 
      Mönckeberg radial (±brachial) artery disease (calcified [C] group) were compared 
      with those obtained in ESRD diabetics who had healthy, noncalcified vessels before 
      RCF construction (healthy [H] group). Vessel calcification was assessed by plain 
      two-dimensional radiography. For inclusion in the C-group, uniform linear railroad 
      track-type macrocalcifications of at least 6 cm in length, in the medial wall of the 
      radial artery ipsilateral to RCF creation, were required. Patients were included in 
      the H-group if the radial artery ipsilateral to the RCF creation was free of any 
      macrocalcification, of either intima or media type. Any intimal-like plaque with 
      irregular and patchy distribution was an exclusion criterion for both groups. 
      Patients in both groups also were required to have suitable upper limb vascular 
      anatomy on the basis of ultrasound imaging before RCF creation (cephalic vein of 
      minimum diameter of 1.6 mm, without stenosis or thrombosis in all outflow areas, and 
      radial artery of minimum diameter of 1.5 mm, without proximal hemodynamically 
      significant stenosis). Secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality. 
      Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparison between groups. RESULTS: The arm 
      radiograph at the site of possible fistula construction showed abnormality in 39 
      patients (C-group, 47 RCFs), whereas 33 patients had noncalcified ("healthy") 
      vascular anatomy (H-group, 40 RCFs). Mean duration of the diabetic disease at the 
      time of RCF creation was 8.9 ± 5.6 years (range, 2-25 years) for the H-group and 14 
      ± 9.9 years (range, 1-40 years) for the C-group (P = .018). The mean follow-up 
      period for H-group and C-group was 51.9 ± 35.9 months (range, 0.1-126 months) and 
      26.1 ± 31.6 months (range, 0.1-144 months), respectively (P = .0006). Forty-four 
      patients died during the follow-up period. Primary patency rates at 12, 24, 36, and 
      48 months for C-group vs H-group were 50.2% vs 80%, 36.5% vs 72.3%, 32.4% vs 67.9%, 
      and 29.1% vs 59.3% (P = .0019). Respective values for secondary patency rates were 
      52.4% vs 87.5%, 40.9% vs 82.4%, 36.6% vs 78.1%, and 33.2% vs 72.8% (P = .00064). 
      Patient survival rates at 24 and 48 months were 56.1% and 46.4% for C-group and 
      92.4% and 67.4% for H-group, respectively (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: ESRD diabetics 
      with radial artery Mönckeberg calcifications receiving RCFs had worse late clinical 
      outcomes compared with ESRD diabetics with healthy distal arm vessels receiving the 
      same access. The long-term benefit of RCFs may be lost in diabetics with extensively 
      calcified vessels, and preferably the brachial artery should be used instead.

AB  - The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic mapping of 
      both arm and forearm vessels before primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) construction 
      in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. There were 129 patients aged 75 
      +/- 6 (65-93) years, 58% men, 37% diabetics, who participated in the study. The 
      inner diameter of veins (under compression) and arteries, and the arterial peak 
      systolic velocity (PSV) were measured. The presence of arterial calcifications was 
      noted. The positions for possible native AVF construction (radiocephalic and 
      brachiocephalic) were suggested and an AVF was constructed by a trained 
      nephrologist. An adequate cephalic vein was present in 76 (59%) patients (diameter 
      4.9 +/- 1.1 mm) in the right arm, and in 83 (64%) patients (4.7 +/- 1.2 mm) in the 
      left arm. Suitable veins in the forearm were recorded in 73 (57%) patients on the 
      right (3.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and in 76 (59%) patients on the left (3.5 +/- 1.0 mm) side. 
      The inner arterial diameter was: brachial-right 4.6 +/- 0.6 mm (calcifications in 
      26%), left 4.6 +/- 0.7 mm (calcifications in 20%); radial-right 2.3 +/- 0.4 mm 
      (calcifications in 36%), left 2.3 +/- 0.5 mm (calcifications in 29%). In 32% of 
      patients, one native AVF was possible, in 17% two, in 23% three and in 18% four, 
      while in 10% no AVF was possible. In 84% of patients an AVF was constructed, with no 
      significant difference in non-diabetic vs. diabetic patients (88% vs. 80%) or 
      females vs. males (87% vs. 83%). Native AVF can be constructed in the majority of 
      elderly patients, often in multiple positions, with no significant differences in 
      terms of sex or diabetic status.

TI  - Copeptin is independently associated with vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease stage 5.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s12882-020-1710-6 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) present in 30-70% of patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Copeptin is a sensitive surrogate marker of arginine vasopressin 
      (AVP), which is involved in many pathophysiologic processes in CKD. The aim of the 
      present study was to explore the association of copeptin with VC in CKD stage 5. 
      METHODS: Copeptin was investigated in conjunction with living donor kidney 
      transplantation in 149 clinically stable CKD stage 5 patients (CKD5), including 53 
      non-dialyzed (CKD5-ND) and 96 dialysis patients treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      (n = 43) or hemodialysis (HD) (n = 53). We analyzed the association of copeptin with 
      presence and extent of VC ascertained both histologically in biopsies from the 
      inferior epigastric artery (n = 137) and by coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      score measured by computed tomography. RESULTS: Patients with higher copeptin were 
      older, had higher systolic blood pressure, higher prevalence of CVD and their 
      preceding time on chronic dialysis was longer. In Spearman's rank correlations 
      (Rho), copeptin concentrations were significantly associated with CAC score 
      (Rho = 0.27; p = 0.003) and presence of medial VC (Rho = 0.21; p = 0.016). 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 1-SD higher age, male gender, 
      diabetes and 1-SD higher copeptin were significantly associated with the presence of 
      moderate-extensive VC. CONCLUSIONS: High circulating levels of copeptin in CKD5 
      patients are independently associated with the degree of medial calcification 
      ascertained by histology of arterial biopsies. Thus, plasma copeptin may serve as a 
      marker of the uremic calcification process.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common cause of death in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). Aortic and mitral valve calcification (AVC and MVC, 
      respectively) are critical indicators of CVD and all-cause mortality in CKD 
      patients.We conducted a single center retrospective study of Chinese inpatients with 
      CKD to identify risk factors associated with valve calcification (VC).Of 288 
      enrolled CKD patients, 22.9% had VC, all of which exhibited AVC, while 21.2% 
      exhibited MVC. The VC group were significantly older than the non-VC group 
      (70.42 ± 11.83 vs 56.47 ± 15.00, P < .001), and contained more patients with history 
      of coronary artery disease (12.1% vs 4.5%, P = .025) or stroke (18.2% vs 5.4%, 
      P < .001). Subjective global assessment scoring indicated that more VC patients were 
      mid/severely malnourished. Levels of prealbumin, cholesterol (Ch), triglycerides, 
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein E, ejection fraction, and fraction 
      shortening were significantly lower, and blood C reactive protein, IL-6, left 
      ventricular internal end diastole diameter measured in end diastole, and 
      interventricular septum thickness (IVST) levels were significantly higher in the VC 
      group. Bone metabolism did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. 
      Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that age, blood Ch, and LDL 
      levels were significantly associated with VC.Advanced age, increased IVST, 
      hypocholesterolemia, and hyper-LDL cholesterolemia were key risk factors for VC in 
      Han patients with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet 
      plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the effect of 
      cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of active vitamin D 
      on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis patients. We 
      report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject characteristics. METHODS: 
      ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized, open-label study. Adult 
      haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (intact 
      parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC 
      score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score (>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and 
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin 
      D (cinacalcet group) or flexible dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The 
      study had three phases: screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC 
      scores obtained by cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and 
      weeks 28 and 52. The primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from 
      baseline to Week 52. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or 
      control. Mean age was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 
      36.7 months (range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the 
      Agatston method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score 
      was independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH. 
      Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The 
      ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
      vascular calcification.

      chronic renal failure.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is excessive in young adults with end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). The factors contributing to ESRD-related vascular disease are 
      incompletely understood. Young adults with childhood-onset chronic renal failure 
      (CRF) are uniquely suited for risk factor assessment because of their long-term 
      exposure at an age when vascular pathology in the general population is still 
      minimal. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used novel noninvasive technologies to screen for 
      coronary and carotid artery disease in 39 patients with ESRD aged 19 to 39 years 
      with childhood-onset CRF presently treated by dialysis or renal transplantation. 
      Coronary artery calcification burden was assessed by CT scan with ECG gating and the 
      intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries by high-resolution ultrasound. 
      Coronary artery calcifications were present in 92% of patients; calcium scores 
      exceeded the 95th age- and sex-specific percentiles >10-fold on average. Carotid IMT 
      was significantly increased compared with matched control subjects. Both coronary 
      calcium scores and IMT were associated with cumulative dialysis and ESRD time and 
      the cumulative serum calcium-phosphate product. Coronary calcium scores were 
      strongly correlated with C-reactive protein and Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositivity, 
      time-averaged mean serum parathyroid hormone, and plasma homocysteine. C-reactive 
      protein and parathyroid hormone independently predicted coronary calcium 
      accumulation. Smoking, obesity, and HbA1c were correlated with IMT in the control 
      subjects but not in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with childhood-onset CRF 
      have a high prevalence of arteriopathy associated with indicators of 
      microinflammation, hyperparathyroidism, calcium-phosphate overload, and 
      hyperhomocysteinemia but not traditional atherogenic risk factors. These risk 
      factors persist even after successful renal transplantation.

TI  - Inflammation, mineral metabolism and progressive coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on haemodialysis.
PG  - 1915-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and common 
      complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this study 
      was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a 2-year period and to identify 
      the factors that may be associated with CAC progression in ESRD patients. METHODS: 
      The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable haemodialysis patients who 
      initially entered into the study. The study population underwent multirow spiral 
      computed tomography to derive CAC scores at baseline and after a minimum of 12 
      months (24 months in 30 patients, 18 months in four, and 12 months in the remaining 
      six patients). To provide a stable estimate that was unbiased with respect to the 
      baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores were used for the analyses of the 
      changes in CAC. RESULTS: The median CAC score was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm3 at 
      baseline and increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm3 at follow-up (P < 0.001) and the 
      median annualized change in square root-transformed CAC score was 1.48 (range, 
      -0.95-8.64) mm3/year. The annualized change of the square root-transformed CAC score 
      positively correlated with the time-integrated levels of C-reactive protein (R = 
      0.521, P = 0.001), phosphorus (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x phosphorus 
      product (R = 0.394, P = 0.012), but did not correlate with the levels of fetuin-A or 
      lipid parameters. Even after adjusting for age, gender and baseline CAC score, 
      C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with CAC progression. 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that chronic inflammation as well as altered mineral 
      metabolism contributes to a rapid progression of CAC in ESRD patients. Additional, 
      larger scale studies are required to confirm our findings.

TI  - Effects of sevelamer on the progression of vascular calcification in patients on 
      chronic haemodialysis.
PG  - c278-83
LID - 10.1159/000127361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a high 
      cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. Control of 
      hyperphosphataemia is important for the treatment of the vascular calcification. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sevelamer hydrochloride on 
      the progression of aortic calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 42 
      HD patients were studied in this study and divided into two groups (sevelamer vs. 
      calcium). Sevelamer was added and titrated up to achieve serum P control for 6 
      months. The estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed 
      tomography scans were performed twice in each patient. We compared the changes in 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and lipids in two groups. 
      RESULTS: Serum phosphorus levels decreased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 
      0.5 mg/dl with no changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels in the 
      sevelamer group (p < 0.01), and increased from 6.5 +/- 1.0 to 6.7 +/- 1.1 mg/dl in 
      the calcium group (p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not change in the sevelamer 
      group and calcium group. The serum levels of total cholesterol decreased 
      significantly from 158.5 +/- 20.7 to 146.2 +/- 24.1 mg/dl (p = 0.024) and the 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level from 65.3 +/- 14.4 to 54.7 +/- 11.6 mg/dl 
      (p = 0.014) in the sevelamer group. Serum C-reactive protein decreased significantly 
      from 0.14 +/- 0.13 to 0.08 +/- 0.11 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (p = 0.038) and 
      significantly increased (0.18 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.12 mg/dl) in the calcium group 
      (p = 0.042). The mean changes in ACI (DeltaACI) were 3.6 +/- 1.5% in the sevelamer 
      group and 8.2 +/- 3.1% in the calcium group. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer allows a better 
      serum phosphorus control compared with calcium-based phosphate binder and suppresses 
      the progression of aortic calcification in HD patients.

TI  - Association of pelvic arterial calcification with arteriovenous thigh graft failure 
      in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2564-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal of 
      the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are 
      associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 
      54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular 
      access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the 
      abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes 
      unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the 
      graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common 
      iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 5-point 
      scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to complete the 
      anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed. RESULTS: There was a 
      high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular calcification (kappa = 0.801). 
      Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on 
      CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six 
      patients (50%) with moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft 
      failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was 
      lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two 
      groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum 
      calcium, serum phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSION: There is a 
      strong association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of 
      thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is 
      predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.

      gender, 54.1 (95%CI, 49.7-58.6) years, median eGFR 28.1 (15.0-47.7) mL/min) 
      diagnosed by renal biopsy during 6 months in our clinic. RRI, carotid intima-media 
      thickness (IMT), Kauppila score for abdominal aortic calcification (AACs) were 
      assessed. Traditional and nontraditional atheroscleosis risk factors were also 
      evaluated. Results: Most of the patients had a diagnosis of glomerular nephropathy, 
      with IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy being the most frequent. RRI increased 
      proportionally with CKD stages. Patients with RRI >0.7 (39%) were older, had 
      diabetic and vascular nephropathies more frequently, higher mean arterial blood 
      pressure, increased systemic atherosclerosis burden (IMT and AACs), higher 
      percentage of global glomerulosclerois, GBM thickness, arteriolosclerosis and 
      interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy. RRI directly correlated with age (rs = 0.55, 
      p < 0.001) and with all the studied atherosclerosis markers (clinical 
      atherosclerosis score rs = 0.50, p = 0.02; AACs rs = 0.50, p < 0.01; IMT rs = 0.34, 
      p = 0.02). Also, global glomerulosclerosis (rs = 0.31, p = 0.03) and interstitial 
      fibrosis/tubular atrophy (rs = 0.35, p = 0.01) were directly correlated with RRI. In 
      multivariable adjusted binomial logistic regression models, only arteriolosclerosis 
      was retained as independent predictor of RRI >0.7. Conclusion: The analysis of RRI 
      may be useful in the evaluation of the general vascular condition of the patient 
      with CKD, supplying information about both microvascular and macrovascular 
      impairment. Moreover, RRI correlates well with renal histopathologic 
      characteristics, particularly with arteriolosclerosis.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as dysfunction of the glomerular filtration 
      apparatus, is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery 
      disease (CAD). Patients with CKD are at a substantially higher risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality compared with the age- and sex-adjusted general population 
      with normal kidney function. The risk of CAD and mortality in patients with CKD is 
      correlated with the degree of renal dysfunction including presence of 
      microalbuminuria. A greater cardiovascular risk, albeit lower than for patients 
      receiving dialysis, persists even after kidney transplantation. Congestive heart 
      failure, commonly caused by CAD, also accounts for a significant portion of the 
      cardiovascular-related events observed in CKD. The optimal strategy for the 
      evaluation of CAD in patients with CKD, particularly before renal transplantation, 
      remains a topic of contention spanning over several decades. Although the evaluation 
      of coexisting cardiac disease in patients with CKD is desirable, severe renal 
      dysfunction limits the use of radiographic and magnetic resonance contrast agents 
      due to concerns regarding contrast-induced nephropathy and nephrogenic systemic 
      sclerosis, respectively. In addition, many patients with CKD have extensive and 
      premature (often medial) calcification disproportionate to the severity of 
      obstructive CAD, thereby limiting the diagnostic value of computed tomography 
      angiography. As such, echocardiography, non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance, 
      nuclear myocardial perfusion, and metabolic imaging offer a variety of approaches to 
      assess obstructive CAD and cardiomyopathy of advanced CKD without the need for 
      nephrotoxic contrast agents.

TI  - Aortic valve calcification is an independent factor of left ventricular hypertrophy 
      in patients on maintenance haemodialysis.
PG  - 1795-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcification and dysfunction of aortic and mitral valves are frequently 
      found in chronic dialysis patients, but their influence on the development of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not well defined. METHODS: Conventional 
      echocardiography and Doppler measurement of trans-aortic flow velocity were 
      performed in 135 chronic haemodialysis patients, and left ventricular mass index 
      (LVMI) and trans-valve pressure gradients were calculated. Average values of 
      systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure (PP), interdialytic weight gain, chronic 
      overhydration (difference between mean post-dialysis and dry weights), plasma 
      calcium, phosphate, haemoglobin, and urea reduction ratio over the year preceding 
      this study were obtained in every patient. RESULTS: Aortic valve calcification was 
      present in 105 patients (78%), associated with stenosis in eight (6%); 39 patients 
      (29%) had aortic regurgitation. Mitral annular calcification occurred in 35 (26%) 
      cases and mitral regurgitation in 45 (33%). LVH was observed in 104 patients (77%). 
      Logistic analysis revealed that only aortic valve calcification predicted LVH. LVMI 
      was higher in patients with aortic valve calcification than in those without 
      calcification: (mean+/-SD) 241+/-52 vs 154+/-64 g/m(2), P=0.001. LVMI was not 
      different between patients with normal, calcified, or regurgitating mitral valves. 
      Patients with aortic valve calcification had higher trans-valve peak flow velocities 
      and pressure gradients than those with non-calcified valves: 1.65+/-0.53 vs 
      1.37+/-0.33 m/s, P=0.01, and 12.1+/-8.9 vs 7.9+/-3.6 mmHg, P=0.01, respectively. The 
      LVMI correlated directly with both variables (r=0.27 and r=0.24, P<0.005). Stepwise 
      linear regression on nine covariates potentially influencing LVMI (age, body mass 
      index, time on dialysis, systolic blood pressure, PP, chronic overhydration, 
      haemoglobin concentration, trans-aortic flow velocity, and urea reduction ratio) 
      showed that LVMI was independently associated with (i) PP, (ii) haemoglobin (inverse 
      correlation), (iii) peak aortic flow velocity, and (iv) chronic overhydration 
      (r=0.502, R(2)=0.252, ANOVA F-ratio=10.19, P<0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our findings show 
      that aortic valve calcification is associated with LVH in chronic haemodialysis 
      patients, probably because valve resistance to ventricular outflow is increased as 
      shown by trans-aortic flow velocities and pressure gradients. The effect on LVMI is 
      independent of PP, anaemia, and overhydration.

TI  - Soluble TWEAK level: is it a marker for cardiovascular disease in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients?
PG  - 136-43
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis 
      (sTWEAK) levels follow declining renal function, are strongly associated with 
      endothelial dysfunction and predict cardiovascular events in nondialyzed chronic 
      kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor 
      survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent evidence suggests a role for sTWEAK 
      in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. The aim of the study was to 
      investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and 
      vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial stiffness by pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by carotid 
      Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long-term prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK 
      levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Mean 
      serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 ± 147.5 pg/mL (range 78-937). sTWEAK level was 
      inversely correlated with CA-IMT at a borderline significance (r=-0.168, p=0.05). 
      Neither carotid-radial PWV nor carotid-femoral PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. 
      sTWEAK level was higher in patients with severe vascular calcification (CACs ≥400) 
      compared to patients with CACs <400 (264.5 ± 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 ± 122.4 pg/mL, 
      p=0.02).The association between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after 
      multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a weak inverse correlation 
      between sTWEAK and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary 
      artery calcification in long-term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for 
      sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.

TI  - Case-control study of calcification of the hepatic artery in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients: comparison with the abdominal aorta and splenic artery.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies of the hepatic artery are scarce. We have observed that 
      hepatic artery calcification is very uncommon in patients with hyperparathyroidism 
      that expedites calcification. METHODS: Plain abdominal CT was studied in 221 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis. Control consisted of 442 sex- and age-matched 
      patients with other diseases. Calcification was graded as a percentage of the entire 
      wall circumference for the aorta, and as a percentage of the entire length of the 
      hepatic and splenic arteries from the celiac trunk to the hilum of each organ. 
      RESULTS: Aortic calcification was seen in 79.2% of male dialysis patients, 22.1% of 
      controls, 74.1% of female dialysis patients and 17.3% of controls (P < 0.0001). 
      Hepatic artery calcification was seen in only 13 dialysis patients. The degree of 
      calcification of the abdominal aorta was correlated with the length of hemodialysis 
      period (P = 0.008), but not with serum calcium, serum phosphate or their product. 
      Although serum parathormone levels were not correlated with calcification, seven of 
      eight dialysis patients with hepatic artery calcification had very high parathormone 
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The hepatic artery is far less frequently calcified than are 
      the abdominal aorta and splenic artery. This may be a teleologic phenomenon of the 
      liver.

TI  - Bilateral versus single internal thoracic artery grafting in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 768-773
LID - 10.1007/s11748-019-01254-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITAs) during 
      myocardial revascularization reportedly provides a survival benefit over using a 
      single internal thoracic artery (SITA). However, the advantages in chronic 
      hemodialysis patients, who generally have multiple comorbidities, is unclear. 
      METHODS: Outcomes of chronic hemodialysis patients who underwent isolated coronary 
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) using a SITA with additional saphenous vein grafts 
      (SVGs) (n = 33) or BITAs (n = 30) for left-side revascularization were 
      retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: With the exception of the rate of diabetes 
      mellitus (SITA vs. BITA: 84.8% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.003), the two groups showed similar 
      patient characteristics. Using the off-pump technique, revascularization was 
      completed without manipulation of the ascending aorta in 45.7% of patients in the 
      BITA group, whereas all patients in the SITA group required aortic manipulation 
      (p < 0.001). Of note, the incidence of extensive aortic calcification (>50% of 
      ascending aorta circumference) was not uncommon (14.3%). The in-hospital mortality 
      (3.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.336) and complication rates (including deep wound infection, 
      re-exploration and stroke) were similar in both groups. The 5-year estimated 
      survival rates for freedom from overall death in the SITA and BITA groups were 42.4% 
      and. 57.4%, respectively (p = 0.202). CONCLUSIONS: BITA grafting was able to achieve 
      revascularization with minimal manipulation of the diseased ascending aorta without 
      increasing the complication rate. The long-term survival benefit of BITA grafting, 
      however, was unclear in dialysis patients, especially because such patients have a 
      relatively short life expectancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been 
      established as an important marker for cardiovascular morbidity, very few studies 
      have studied it in end-stage renal disease patients. Thus we examined and evaluate 
      risk factors of calcification changes in dialysis patients. METHOD: Among 28 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients, CAC was measured in Agatston units at baseline and after 
      five years using the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT. The HD patients were classified 
      as progressors or no progressors according to the change in the CAC score across 
      these 2 measurements. RESULTS: Over an average 63 months follow-up, participants 
      without CAC at baseline had no incident CAC. The progression of CAC was slow and was 
      found only in 6 patients (21.4%). It was significantly associated with several 
      cardiovascular risk factors, namely, older age (P=0.03), diabetes (P=0.05), male sex 
      (P=0.02), hypercholesterolemia (P=0.05), anemia (P=0.017), inflammation (P=0.05), 
      and hyperphosphataemia (P=0.012). However, calcemia, parathormone levels, dialysis 
      duration, tobacco, high blood pressure and dialysis dose did not seem to influence 
      the progression of CAC in our series. A strong association was found between basal 
      calcification scores and Delta increment at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests 
      that CAC progression in dialysis is a complex phenomenon, associated with several 
      risk factors with special regard to elevated basal scores. This progression can be 
      avoided or slowed with appropriate management, which must begin in the early stages 
      of chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk stratification in rheumatic diseases: carotid ultrasound is more 
      sensitive than Coronary Artery Calcification Score to detect subclinical 
      atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1764-70
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-203688 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of Coronary Artery Calcification Score (CACS) 
      and carotid ultrasonography in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis in rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA). METHODS: A set of 104 consecutive RA patients without history of 
      cardiovascular (CV) events were studied to determine CACS, carotid intima-media 
      thickness (cIMT) and plaques. Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) modified 
      according to the EULAR recommendations (mSCORE) was also assessed. RESULTS: The mean 
      disease duration was 10.8 years, 72.1% had rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP 
      positivity and 16.4% extra-articular manifestations. Nine were excluded because they 
      had type 2 diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. CV risk was categorised in 
      the remaining 95 RA patients according to the mSCORE as follows: low (n=21), 
      moderate (n=60) and high/very high risk (n=14). Most patients with low mSCORE 
      (16/21; 76.2%) had normal CACS (zero), and none of them CACS>100. However, a high 
      number of patients with carotid plaques was disclosed in the groups with CACS 0 
      (23/40; 57.5%) or CACS 1-100 (29/38; 76.3%). 72 (75.8%) of the 95 patients fulfilled 
      definitions for high/very high CV as they had an mSCORE ≥5% or mSCORE <5% plus one 
      of the following findings: severe carotid ultrasonography findings (cIMT>0.9 mm 
      and/or plaques) or CACS>100. A CACS>100 showed sensitivity similar to mSCORE (23.6% 
      vs 19.4%). In contrast, the presence of severe carotid ultrasonography findings 
      allowed identifying most patients who met definitions for high/very high CV risk 
      (70/72; sensitivity 97.2% (95% CI 90.3 to 99.7)). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid 
      ultrasonography is more sensitive than CACS for the detection of subclinical 
      atherosclerosis in RA.

TI  - Arterial changes in paediatric haemodialysis patients undergoing renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 2041-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between primary renal disease and arterial wall changes 
      in paediatric haemodialysis patients has been little studied. The aim of the present 
      work was to determine the influence of primary renal disease on arterial wall 
      pathology in uraemic paediatric patients. METHODS: Twelve paediatric haemodialysis 
      patients (seven girls, five boys) aged 11-17 years were included in the study. The 
      primary renal diseases were urinary malformations in six patients (uropathy group) 
      and acquired glomerular diseases (glomerulopathy group) in six patients. Age, sex 
      distribution, duration of chronic renal failure, duration of haemodialysis, blood 
      pressure, serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, fibrinogen, calcium, phosphorus 
      and parathyroid hormone levels were compared. Internal iliac artery samples were 
      obtained at the time of related-donor renal transplantation. Artery samples were 
      fixed in formaldehyde and sections were stained separately with haematoxylin and 
      eosin, Orcein, Verhoef-van Gieson, and Masson trichrome. RESULTS: Five arteries had 
      fibrous or fibroelastic intimal thickening, medial mucoid ground substance and 
      disruption of the internal elastic lamella. Two of these had microcalcification in 
      the intimal layer; another two demonstrated atheromatous plaques; the remaining five 
      were normal. These pathological changes were found in the arteries of all six 
      patients with uropathy, whereas of the six patients with glomerulopathy only one had 
      arterial changes (P<0.001). The duration of chronic renal failure was 4.8+/-1.9 
      years in the uropathy group and 2.2+/-1.2 in the glomerulopathy group (P<0.05). The 
      two groups were comparable in terms of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, 
      fibrinogen, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels, presence of hypertension, sex 
      distribution, and duration of haemodialysis. Plasma phosphorus and the calcium x 
      phosphate product were higher in the uropathy group than in the glomerulopathy group 
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that pathological changes are common 
      in the arteries of uraemic paediatric patients, and that calcification and 
      atherosclerosis are integral to this disease process. In our study, these 
      alterations were more common in the patients with uropathy. We speculate that the 
      patients with uropathy are more prone to these alterations due to slower progression 
      and a longer duration of renal insufficiency.

PG  - 844-54

AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of 
      arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of 
      atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification 
      inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry 
      parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a 
      cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 
      age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in 
      maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, 
      hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by 
      electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD 
      parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. 
      CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in 
      patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, 
      neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A 
      concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less 
      than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of 
      plaques in coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A 
      levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum 
      fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter 
      of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an 
      association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone 
      mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, 
      the results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design 
      of the study.

TI  - Hypoparathyroidism potentiates cardiovascular complications through disturbed 
      calcium metabolism: possible risk of vitamin D(3) analog administration in dialysis 
      patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Progressive cardiovascular calcification in dialysis patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious complication; however, the precise 
      mechanism remains uncertain. We tested whether metabolic calcium abnormalities and 
      hypoparathyroidism might have a correlation with cardiovascular complications in 
      ESRD patients. METHODS: A series of 48 ESRD patients with cardiovascular diseases 
      and/or congestive heart failure, aged 36-82 (61 +/- 12) years, 23 male and 25 
      female, were enrolled in this study. Serum total calcium (Ca, mmol/l), inorganic 
      phosphate (mmol/l), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, pg/ml) levels were 
      determined in all cases. RESULTS: Organic heart disease was confirmed in 28 patients 
      (58.3%), including 15 with coronary artery disease: 8 with aortic aneurysm, 8 with 
      stenotic valvular heart disease, 9 with excessive mitral annular calcification, 3 
      with dialysis cardiomyopathy, and 7 with obstructive arterial disease. Serum iPTH 
      measurement revealed hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) in 20 of 48 (41.7%) and 
      hyperthyroidism (iPTH >/=200) in 13 of 48 (27.1%) subjects. The 20 patients with low 
      iPTH had a higher prevalence of valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca level 
      corrected for serum albumin (2.70 +/- 0.30 in low iPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 in normal 
      iPTH, 2.35 +/- 0.20 in high iPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of vitamin D(3) 
      analog use (65% in low iPTH vs. 33% in normal iPTH and 46% in high iPTH, p = 0.078). 
      Moreover, corrected serum Ca exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with serum 
      iPTH: corrected Ca = -0.284x log (iPTH) + 3.021 (r = 0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis revealed diabetes and hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) as 
      risk factors for cardiovascular complications in ESRD. CONCLUSION: These results 
      suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in conjunction with vitamin D(3) 
      use might play an important role in cardiovascular complications of chronic dialysis 
      patients.

AB  - While all mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are unknown, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be 
      involved in this process in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the association between ACE2 and CAC in patients on MHD 
      therapy. Ninety patients on MHD therapy were involved in this prospective study. CAC 
      was quantified by CAC score (CACs) using the Agatston method and a multi-slice CT 
      scanner. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the 
      association between ACE2 and CACs. In the univariate analysis, CACs positively 
      correlated with ACE2 (r = 0.666, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, 
      hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, ACE2 levels 
      continued to significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve 
      analysis showed that the serum ACE2 level can predict the extent of CAC. These 
      findings indicate that elevated serum ACE2 may be involved in vascular calcification 
      in patients receiving MHD therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in renal 
      transplant recipients (RT). Coronary artery disease (CAD) in such patients is poorly 
      studied. METHODS: During 2012-2017, 50 patients with a renal graft (functioning for 
      a minimum of 6 months) were subjected to coronary angiography in our institution. 
      They were matched (for age, gender, diabetes, and indication for angiography) with 
      50 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic dialysis and 50 
      patients with normal renal function who were subjected to coronary angiography 
      during the same period. The extent and severity of CAD were assessed by using the 
      SYNTAX score. RESULTS: RT had a significantly longer duration of ESRD than patients 
      on dialysis (17.5±7.1 vs. 8.5±8.7 years, p<0.01). Mean SYNTAX score was 13.3±12.0 in 
      RT, 20.6±17.5 in patients on dialysis, and 9.4±9.2 in control patients (p<0.01). At 
      least one significantly calcified lesion was present in 75.7% of RT recipients, 
      92.1% of patients on dialysis, and 15.8% of control patients (p<0.01). Percutaneous 
      coronary intervention (PCI) was successful in 93.8% of the attempted cases in RT, 
      75% of patients on chronic dialysis, and 100% of control patients (p=0.04). In the 
      RT group, SYNTAX score significantly correlated with smoking (p=0.02) and the total 
      vintage of ESRD (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this angiographic study, CAD was less 
      severe in RT than in patients on long-term dialysis despite a longer duration of 
      ESRD. Coronary artery calcification was highly prevalent after renal 
      transplantation. PCI in RT had a high rate of angiographic success.

TI  - Study on the relationship of serum fetuin-A concentration with aortic stiffness in 
      patients on dialysis.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in aortic stiffness, as reflected by an increase in pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) or aortic augmentation index (AI) is an important predictor of 
      cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Dysregulation of calcification 
      inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, is involved in vascular pathology in dialysis patients 
      and fetuin-A is inversely related to mortality in dialysis patients. In this study, 
      the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration and parameters of aortic stiffness 
      was investigated in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: In a 
      cross-sectional study we included 131 dialysis patients, aged 62+/-14 years (33 on 
      peritoneal dialysis and 98 on haemodialysis), and 41 controls, aged 60+/-8 years. 
      Time-averaged pre-dialysis values of serum albumin, Ca, P and intact parathyroid 
      hormone were included in multiregression analysis, as were high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fetuin-A, age, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and dialysis 
      modality. PWV and AI were measured with the SphygmoCor device. RESULTS: Mean 
      fetuin-A concentration in dialysis patients (0.63+/-0.16 g/l) did not differ from 
      controls (0.63+/-0.11 g/l). Median hsCRP levels in dialysis patients were higher 
      compared with controls (4.0 vs 1.9 mg/l; P<0.0001). PWV but not AI was higher in 
      dialysis patients than in controls (9.9 vs 7.9 m/s; P<0.0001). In univariate 
      analysis in dialysis patients, fetuin-A levels were inversely related to both PWV (r 
      = - 0.25, P = 0.007) and AI (r = - 0.26, P = 0.006), respectively. However, after 
      correction for age, gender, MAP and diabetes mellitus, this relation lost 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In a dialysis population with a relatively 
      low level of inflammatory activity, the soluble calcification inhibitor fetuin-A 
      could not be identified as an independent predictor of aortic stiffness as measured 
      with PWV and AI.

TI  - Morphology of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: An excessive rate of cardiac death is a well-known feature of renal 
      failure. Coronary heart disease is frequent and the possibility has been raised that 
      the natural history of the coronary plaque is different in uraemic patients. We 
      assessed the morphology of coronary arteries in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure and compared them with coronary arteries of matched non-uraemic control 
      patients. METHODS: Fifty-four cases were identified at autopsy who met the inclusion 
      criteria: cases, end-stage renal disease (n=27); controls, non-renal patients with 
      coronary artery disease (n=27). At autopsy all three coronary arteries were prepared 
      at corresponding sites for investigations: (i) qualitative analysis (after Stary), 
      (ii) quantitative measurements of intima and media thickness (by planimetry), (iii) 
      immunohistochemical analysis of the coronary plaques and (iv) X-ray diffraction of 
      selected calcified plaques. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of the coronary arteries 
      showed significantly more calcified plaques of coronary arteries in patients with 
      end-stage renal failure. Plaques of non-uraemic patients were mostly 
      fibroatheromatous. Media thickness of coronary arteries was significantly higher in 
      uraemic patients (187+/-53 microm vs 135+/-29 microm in controls) and intima 
      thickness tended to be higher (158+/-38 microm vs 142+/-31 microm) but this 
      difference was not statistically significant. Plaque area (4.09+/-1. 50 mm(2) vs 
      4.39+/-0.88 mm(2)) was comparable in both groups. Lumen area, however, was 
      significantly lower in end-stage renal patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of the 
      cellular infiltrate in coronary arteries showed no major differences in these 
      advanced plaques of uraemic and non-uraemic subjects. CONCLUSION: Coronary plaques 
      in patients with end-stage renal failure are characterized by increased media 
      thickness and marked calcification. In contrast to the previous opinion the most 
      marked difference compared to non-uraemic controls does not concern the size, but 
      the composition of the plaque. Deposition of calcium within the plaques may 
      contribute to the high complication rate in uraemic patients.

TI  - How long is the warranty period for nil or low coronary artery calcium in patients 
      new to hemodialysis?
PG  - 255-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with advanced 
      chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A sizeable proportion of patients has no or 
      minimal CAC at the inception of dialysis, but it is unclear how long they remain 
      free of it. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, 36 incident hemodialysis 
      patients were submitted to sequential chest computed tomography to quantify CAC at 
      baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 30 months. RESULTS: Among them, 15 had absent or minimal CAC 
      score (CACS 0 to 30) and 21 had a CACS>30 at baseline. Overall, the median baseline 
      CACS was 129 (interquartile range [IQR]=0-709) and it increased to 364 
      (IQR=8.3-1683) at study completion (182% increase). Among the 15 patients with 
      minimal CACS, only 3 progressed and the median CACS increase was 20, as opposed to 
      15 of 21 patients with a baseline CACS>30 whose median progression was 431 (p<0.02). 
      The 18 patients who had CACS progression were older (68.5 vs. 57.3 years, p=0.0081) 
      and exhibited a poorer control of mineral metabolism (phosphorus 5.2 vs. 4.9 mg/ dL, 
      p=0.048; corrected calcium x phosphorus product [CaxP] 49.3 vs. 46.2 mg2/dL2, 
      p=0.001) than the patients without progression. On multivariable analysis, 
      independent predictors of progression were baseline CACS (p=0.038) and time-averaged 
      Cax;P (p=0.077). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that absent or low CAC at baseline 
      is associated with minimal progression even up to 30 months. Careful management of 
      mineral metabolism appears to be one of the main factors that limit progression of 
      CAC.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Coronary Artery Calcification Among Patients With 
      CKD: The CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent among 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases risks for cardiovascular 
      disease events and mortality. We hypothesized that a novel serum measure of 
      calcification propensity is associated with CAC among patients with CKD stages 2 
      to 4. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Participants 
      from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study with baseline (n=1,274) and 
      follow-up (n=780) CAC measurements. PREDICTORS: Calcification propensity, quantified 
      as transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, 
      with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. Covariates 
      included age, sex, race/ethnicity, clinical site, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, proteinuria, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive 
      medications, current smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, total cholesterol 
      level, and use of statin medications. OUTCOMES: CAC prevalence, severity, incidence, 
      and progression. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear 
      models. RESULTS: At baseline, 824 (65%) participants had prevalent CAC. After 
      multivariable adjustment, T(50) was not associated with CAC prevalence but was 
      significantly associated with greater CAC severity among participants with prevalent 
      CAC: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 21% (95% CI, 6%-38%) greater CAC severity. 
      Among 780 participants followed up an average of 3 years later, 65 (20%) without 
      baseline CAC developed incident CAC, while 89 (19%) with baseline CAC had 
      progression, defined as annual increase≥100 Agatston units. After multivariable 
      adjustment, T(50) was not associated with incident CAC but was significantly 
      associated with CAC progression: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 28% (95% CI, 
      7%-53%) higher risk for CAC progression. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias in 
      follow-up analyses; inability to distinguish intimal from medial calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2 to 4, higher serum calcification 
      propensity is associated with more severe CAC and CAC progression.

TI  - Coronary-artery calcium scores using electron beam CT in patients with chronic renal 
      failure.
PG  - 994-9
AB  - We evaluated the risk of coronary-artery disease in patients with chronic renal 
      failure (CRF) by measuring the coronary-artery calcium scores with electron beam CT 
      (EBCT). A total of 81 CRF patients were divided into three groups; pre-dialysis 
      (group I, n = 35), hemodialysis (group II, n = 31) and peritoneal dialysis (group 
      III, n = 15). The several serum biochemical markers and calcium score levels by EBCT 
      were determined. The Ca x P products were significantly higher in groups II (p < 
      0.05) and III (p < 0.01) than in group I. The serum calcium levels were 
      significantly higher in group III than in both group I (p < 0.01) and II (p < 0.05). 
      The serum calcium level in 15 patients with a calcium score > 400 was significantly 
      higher than the 66 patients with a score < or =400 (p < 0.01). The calcium score was 
      significantly higher in the 15 patients with cardiovascular complications than in 
      the 66 patients without cardiovascular complications (628.9+/-904.8 vs. 
      150.4+/-350.9, p < 0.01). EBCT seemed to be a good diagnostic tool for evaluating 
      the risk of coronary-artery disease ''noninvasively'' in CRF patients who are at 
      increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - The Relationship Between Obesity and Calciphylaxis: A Review of the Literature.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel 
      arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). A review of the literature was conducted to explore existing 
      evidence about the relationship between obesity and calciphylaxis. A total of 54 
      publications (published between 1962 and 2015) were identified. Most studies noted a 
      variety of risk factors for calciphylaxis, including CKD, female gender, Caucasian 
      race, liver disease, and lower serum albumin. Obesity was identified as a risk 
      factor in 6 of the 8 studies reviewed. In one study, obesity was found to increase 
      the risk of calciphylaxis 4-fold. The majority of calciphylaxis lesions in obese 
      persons were proximal in distribution; all studies report proximal lesions are 
      associated with a higher mortality rate than distal lesions. The mortality rate of 
      persons with CKD and calciphylaxis is 8 times higher than that of persons with CKD 
      without calciphylaxis. There is no definitive evidence to support the belief current 
      epidemic rates of obesity, diabetes, (diabesity), and chronic renal disease will 
      predispose more patients to the development of calciphylaxis. However, until more 
      information from the calciphylaxis registries and other studies is available, 
      clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when a patient presents with 
      indurated, painful nodules or necrotic ulcers, especially if the patient also has 
      CKD.

      Lesions.
PG  - 593-599
LID - 10.1177/1526602819870309 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine if endovascular therapy (EVT) with paclitaxel-coated stents 
      increases the mortality risk in patients with symptomatic lower limb peripheral 
      artery disease (PAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted 
      of paclitaxel-coated stent use in the femoropopliteal segment of 1535 symptomatic 
      (Rutherford category 2 to 4) patients treated between January 2010 and December 2016 
      at 4 hospitals in Japan. The risk of all-cause mortality was examined between the 
      285 patients (mean age 73±8 years; 213 men) treated with a paclitaxel-coated stent 
      (PTX-coated group) and 1250 patients (mean age 73±9 years; 872 men) not exposed to a 
      paclitaxel-coated device (PTX-free group) during EVT. Propensity score matching was 
      employed to balance baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models 
      stratified on the quintiles of the propensity score were used to investigate 
      paclitaxel-coated stent use and mortality risk as well as interactions among 
      baseline variables and the main outcome. Interactions between a PXT-coated stent and 
      subgroups of the PTX-free group (bare stent and angioplasty) were also investigated, 
      as was the impact of paclitaxel dose on mortality risk. The results of regression 
      analysis are reported as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
      RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival estimates were 86.4% in the PTX-coated group vs 
      87.7% in the PTX-free group; the corresponding 5-year estimates were 77.5% vs 73.7%, 
      respectively. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the 
      2 groups (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.19, p=0.41). The cause of death also showed no 
      remarkable difference between the groups. Chronic renal failure (p=0.044) and 
      arterial calcification (p=0.022) demonstrated a significant interaction effect on 
      the association of the use of a PTX-coated stent with all-cause mortality. No 
      subgroup demonstrated that the use of a paclitaxel-coated stent was associated with 
      an increased risk of all-cause mortality. A dose dependency was not evident. 
      CONCLUSION: Mortality risk following application of a PTX-coated stent did not 
      increase over 5 years, irrespective of the dose. A PTX-coated stent for 
      femoropopliteal lesions in PAD patients is a safe treatment option.

TI  - Lower concentrations of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be associated 
      with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans with normal renal 
      function.
PG  - 1465-70
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.110.001974 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum phosphorus concentrations are associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency. 
      This association has also been reported in Western individuals without chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: It is unclear, however, whether this correlation 
      occurs in Korean individuals without CKD, who usually ingest less phosphorus than do 
      Western individuals. DESIGN: We reviewed the findings in 402 healthy Korean adults 
      with a mean (±SD) age of 50.8 ± 8.5 y (n = 257 men and 145 women) and a glomerular 
      filtration rate of 83.5 ± 14.1 mL/min, who underwent health screening with 
      electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). The study population was separated into 4 
      groups on the basis of the coronary calcium concentration (Agatston score: 0, >0 to 
      ≤10, >10 to ≤100, and >100). Mean serum phosphorus concentrations, measured ≥10 y 
      before EBCT, were compared. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 
      0.001), male sex (P = 0.002), family history of CVD (P = 0.006), serum glucose (P = 
      0.003), and serum phosphorus >3.6 mg/dL (P = 0.008) were significant factors 
      influencing the coronary calcification group with an Agatston score >100, when those 
      with an Agatston score of 0 were considered as the reference group. Compared with 
      the group with a serum phosphorus concentration ≤3.3 mg/dL, the OR of an Agatston 
      score >100 in individuals with a serum phosphorus concentration >3.6 to ≤3.9 mg/dL 
      was 3.89 (95% CI: 1.43, 10.63; P = 0.008) and in those with a serum phosphorus 
      concentration >3.9 mg/dL was 3.17 (95% CI: 1.19, 8.41; P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: A 
      lower concentration of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be associated 
      with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans with normal renal 
      function.

TI  - Osteocalcin (bone GLA protein) levels, vascular calcifications, vertebral fractures 
      and mortality in hemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00595-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as one of the major causes of 
      end stage kidney disease. Bone Gla protein (BGP) is a vitamin K-dependent protein 
      involved in bone mineralization and vascular calcifications (VC). Our goal was to 
      characterize BGP and undercarboxylated BGP (ucBGP) in DM patients on HD, compared to 
      HD patients without DM, and their association with vascular and bone disease. 
      METHODS: 387 HD patients from 18 dialysis centers in Italy. Associations of DM, 
      levels of BGP, vitamin D and VC were evaluated. Time-to-event analysis for all-cause 
      mortality was performed by the Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: Patients with DM had lower 
      levels of total BGP (139.00 vs. 202.50 mcg/L, p < 0.001), 25(OH)D (23.4 vs. 
      30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and ucBGP (9.24 vs. 11.32 mcg/L, p = 0.022). In regression 
      models, the geometric means of total BGP and ucBGP were 19% (p = 0.009) and 26% 
      (p = 0.034) lower in diabetic patients. In univariate Cox regression analysis, DM 
      patients had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR:1.83, 95% CI 1.13-2.96, 
      p = 0.014). Adjustment for confounders confirmed the significant DM-mortality link. 
      We included VC and warfarin into the Cox model, the DM-mortality link was no longer 
      significant, suggesting a role of these risk factors as causal mediators leading to 
      increased mortality in dialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients have an increased 
      mortality risk associated with DM. Furthermore, we found an association between DM 
      and decreased BGP levels. Although our study does not support the notion that BGP 
      levels act as mediator in the DM-mortality link, to our knowledge this is the first 
      study in HD patients suggesting a potential protective role of BGP in the bone, 
      endocrine and vascular pathway.

TI  - Renal artery wall 18F-NaF activity and glomerular filtration rate: an exploratory 
      analysis in a high cardiovascular risk population.
PG  - 126-132
LID - 10.1097/MNM.0000000000001128 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerotic plaque molecular imaging with F-sodium fluoride (NaF) 
      PET with computed tomography (PET-CT) may identify active unstable 
      microcalcification. We sought to explore renal arteries calcification activity in a 
      group of high cardiovascular (CV) risk subjects without manifest CV disease. 
      METHODS: High CV risk hypertensive individuals from a single centre were 
      prospectively scanned with F-NaF-PET-CT in major vascular territories. Renal 
      arterial wall activity was retrospectively analysed and expressed as the ratio 
      between maximum standard uptake value in the lesion and mean blood pool activity in 
      the superior vena cava [tissue-to-background ratio (TBR)]. We explored renal artery 
      wall F-NaF activity's association to CV risk factors and renal function. RESULTS: 
      Mean age was 64 ± 8.6 years, 56% male, 96% Caucasian and 24% had chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) (n = 25). Six individuals (24%) showed renal artery wall radiotracer 
      uptake (TBR 1.4 ± 0.4); these subjects were heavier, had higher triglycerides, 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and predicted CV risk (SCORE) compared to the 
      remaining cohort (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). There was a trend toward higher 
      F-NaF uptake in other major vessels and increased thoracic fat volume in subjects 
      with renal artery wall uptake. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was lower in 
      subjects with positive renal plaques (93.0 ± 29.7 vs. 65.0 ± 19.7 ml/min, P = 0.04). 
      Renal artery radiotracer uptake and eGFR were inversely correlated (r = -0.42, P = 
      0.04). CONCLUSION: In a high CV risk group without manifest CV disease, higher renal 
      artery wall F-NaF activity is associated with superior predicted CV risk and lower 
      GFR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endovascular tibial interventions for chronic limb-threatening ischemia 
      are frequent, but the implications of early failure (≤30 days) of an isolated tibial 
      intervention are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the 
      patient-centered outcomes after early failure of isolated tibial artery 
      intervention. METHODS: A database of patients undergoing lower extremity 
      endovascular interventions between 2007 and 2017 was retrospectively queried. 
      Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (Rutherford classes 4, 5, and 6) 
      were selected, and failures within 30 days were identified. Lack of technical 
      success at the time of the procedure was an exclusion. Intention-to-treat analysis 
      by patient was performed. Patient-oriented outcomes of clinical efficacy (absence of 
      recurrent symptoms, maintenance of ambulation, and absence of major amputation), 
      amputation-free survival (survival without major amputation), and freedom from major 
      adverse limb events (MALEs; above-ankle amputation of the index limb or major 
      reintervention [new bypass graft, jump or interposition graft revision]) were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: There were 1779 patients (58% male; average age, 65 years; 2898 
      vessels) who underwent tibial intervention for chronic limb-threatening ischemia; 
      284 procedures (16%) were early failures. In the early failure group, 124 cases 
      (44%) were considered immediate (<24 hours), and 160 cases (56%) failed within the 
      first 30 days after intervention. The two modes of failure were hemodynamic failure 
      (47%) and progression of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (53%). Bypass after early 
      failure was successful in patients with adequate vein, target vessel of ≥3 mm, and 
      good inframalleolar runoff. Progression of symptoms was associated with major 
      amputation in patients with Rutherford class 5 and class 6 disease. Presentation 
      with diabetes and end-stage renal disease were identified as independent clinical 
      predictors for early failure. Lesion calcification, reference vessel diameter <3 mm, 
      lesion length >300 mm, and poor inframalleolar runoff were identified as independent 
      anatomic predictors for early failure and increased MALEs. Early failure was 
      predictive of poor long-term clinical efficacy (11% ± 9% vs 39% ± 8% at 5 years, 
      mean ± standard error of the mean, early vs no early failure; P = .01) and 
      amputation-free survival (16% ± 9% vs 47% ± 9% at 5 years, mean ± standard error of 
      the mean, early vs no early failure; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Both clinical and 
      anatomic factors can predict early failure of endovascular therapy for isolated 
      tibial disease. Early failure significantly increases 30-day major amputation and 
      30-day MALEs and is associated with poor long-term patient-centered outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF-23) is the main regulator of phosphate metabolism. In this prospective study, 
      we aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-23 with progression of coronary 
      artery calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Seventy-four HD patients (36 male/38 
      female, mean age: 52 ± 14 years) were included. Serum FGF-23 levels were measured by 
      ELISA. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was measured twice with one year 
      interval. Patients were grouped as progressive (PG) (36 patients-48%) and 
      non-progressive (NPG). RESULTS: Age, serum phosphorus, baseline and first year CACS 
      were found to be significantly higher in the PG compared to NPG group. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were significantly higher in PG [155 (80-468) vs 147 (82-234), p = 0.04]. 
      Patients were divided into two groups according to baseline CACS (low group, CACS ≤ 
      30; high group, CACS > 30). Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly correlated with 
      the progression of CACS (ΔCACS) in the low baseline CACS group (r = 0.51, p = 
      0.006), but this association was not found in high baseline CACS group (r = 0.11, p 
      = 0.44). In logistic regression analysis for predicting the PG patients; serum 
      FGF-23, phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were retained as significant factors in 
      the model. CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF-23 was found to be related to progression of CACS 
      independent of serum phosphorus levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in the 
      progression of vascular calcification especially at the early stages of 
      calcification process in HD patients.

TI  - Mitral valve calcification as an index of left ventricular dysfunction in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - To determine whether mitral valve or anulus calcification (MC) in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease is associated with abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) 
      structure and function, cardiac characteristics of 55 patients undergoing continuous 
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with (n = 26; age: 59 +/- 10 years) vs without 
      (n = 29; age: 58 +/- 12 years) MC were analyzed using echocardiography and Doppler 
      echocardiography. Sclerosis of the mitral valve anulus was detected in 18 (7 women, 
      11 men; age: 58 +/- 10 years) patients, sclerosis of mitral valve leaflets in 24 (13 
      women, 9 men; age: 59 +/- 10 years) patients. Patients with MC had higher systolic 
      arterial blood pressure before initiation of dialysis therapy (191/104 mm Hg vs 
      173/94 mm Hg; p < 0.05) and higher calcium-phosphorus products (55 +/- 13 vs 42 +/- 
      16; p < 0.05) during CAPD therapy than those without MC. Neither prevalence nor 
      severity of MC was related to dialysis duration or patient age. Systolic LV function 
      was reduced (ejection fraction: 58 +/- 12 percent vs 65 +/- 13 percent; p < 0.05) 
      and LV end-diastolic diameters were dilated (54 +/- 5 vs 50 +/- 8 mm; p < 0.05) in 
      patients with MC. Left atrial dilatation (73 percent vs 31 percent; p < 0.005) and 
      mitral valve regurgitation (65 percent vs 21 percent; p < 0.001) were more frequent 
      in patients with vs those without MC. Excluding patients with significant mitral 
      regurgitation from pulsed Doppler analysis, diastolic LV function was comparably 
      impaired in patients with vs those without MC (maximal early/atrial filling velocity 
      ratio: 0.77 +/- 0.25 vs 0.75 +/- 0.22; atrial filling fraction: 47 +/- 10 percent vs 
      48 +/- 11 percent; p = NS). The presented data suggest that MC follows long-standing 
      and severe arterial hypertension before start of dialysis therapy. Therefore, 
      effective blood pressure control in the predialysis period may be a tool to prevent 
      these lesions. MC has clinical significance as a marker of LV dilatation and reduced 
      LV systolic function in patients with chronic CAPD.

TI  - Peritoneal magnesium elimination and its clinical relevance in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 181-186
LID - 10.5414/CN110115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients are at increased risk for vascular calcification and 
      cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggests that magnesium might be protective 
      for the vascular system in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as well. However, only 
      limited data is available on the elimination of magnesium through PD treatment. This 
      study aims to evaluate the peritoneal magnesium elimination characteristics in 
      comparison to other small solutes and the influence of peritoneal transport status. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peritoneal elimination of magnesium, blood-urea-nitrogen 
      (BUN), and creatinine during a 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was 
      assessed in 30 stable PD patients. Absolute magnesium elimination was compared 
      overall and between creatinine transport tertiles. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years, 
      50% of patients were male, 20% were on automated PD treatment. Serum magnesium was 
      0.84 mmol/L, and dialysate magnesium at the end of the PET was 0.57 mmol/L in the 
      overall cohort and did not differ significantly between tertiles. The magnesium 
      dialysate-to-plasma ratio was significantly different between the subgroups (lower 
      tertile: median 0.60 (minimum 0.52, maximum 0.68) vs. middle tertile: 0.64 (0.58, 
      0.68) vs. upper tertile: 0.69 (0.67, 0.74), p &lt; 0.001). The elimination per liter 
      of dialysis fluid was also significantly different (8.6 (6.6, 10.4) vs. 9.4 (8.0, 
      10.5) vs. 10.6 (0.2, 11.8) mg/L, p = 0.002), as was the absolute removal during the 
      4-hour dwell (18.6 (15.8, 21.2) vs. 19.4 (13.4, 24.6) vs. 22.7 (19.6, 31.9) mg, 
      p = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal magnesium elimination is similar to 
      small solute transport characteristics. However, the absolute differences among 
      patients with slower and faster transport types are small. Therefore, magnesium 
      supplementation in PD patients should be guided by serum magnesium concentrations 
      rather than the amount of peritoneal elimination.

TI  - Soluble osteopontin and vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification often occurs in patients with uremia. As 
      osteopontin (OPN) is not only involved in the physiological but also the 
      pathological calcification of tissues, OPN may be associated with the pathogenesis 
      of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We examined the 
      expression of OPN in atherosclerotic aortas of HD patients. In addition, we 
      performed a prospective longitudinal study by using CT scans to detect aortic 
      calcifications and by measuring the plasma OPN concentration by ELISA in HD patients 
      (20 men, 16 women; mean age 55.2 +/- 21.3 years) and in healthy volunteers (18 men, 
      17 women; mean age 54.0 +/- 13.2 years). RESULTS: By immunohistochemical staining, 
      OPN was abundantly localized in atherosclerotic plaques of HD patients. The 
      macrophages surrounding the atheromatous plaques were identified as the 
      OPN-expressing cells. We furthermore found that the concentration of soluble plasma 
      OPN was significantly higher in HD patients as compared with the concentrations in 
      age-matched healthy volunteers (837.3 +/- 443.2 vs. 315.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml, p < 
      0.01). The OPN concentration was positively correlated with the aortic calcification 
      index in HD patients (r = 0.749, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that OPN, 
      secreted by macrophages, plays a role in the calcification of atheromatous plaques 
      in HD patients.

TI  - Calcified plaque is common in the carotid and femoral arteries of dialysis patients 
      without clinical vascular disease.
PG  - 2004-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac and vascular mortality are common in end-stage renal disease 
      (ERSD) and are often attributed to accelerated atherosclerosis. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: We studied 24 non-diabetic ESRD patients without cardiac or vascular 
      disease (M = 12, F = 12) and 24 age-, sex- and race-matched healthy controls. All 
      underwent B-mode ultrasound for carotid and femoral intima media thickness (IMT) and 
      plaque (% stenosis) together with blood pressure (BP), and echocardiograms to 
      determine left ventricular mass. RESULTS: Both BP and mean IMT were similar in 
      patients and controls. However, discrete plaque was present in 71% (17/24) of 
      patients compared with 21% (5/24) of controls (P = 0.001), and % stenosis was 
      greater in patients (carotid 12.2 +/- 11% vs 2.3 +/- 5.9%, P < 0.0004; femoral 16.4 
      +/- 19.1% vs 3.1 +/- 6.4%, P < 0.003). Plaque was soft/atheromatous in 3 of the 5 
      controls, but not in any of the 17 patients (P = 0.007), all of whom had calcified 
      lesions. BP and cholesterol were not correlated with IMT or plaque in patients, but 
      in control subjects carotid IMT was correlated with systolic BP (r = 0.66, P < 
      0.0005) and diastolic BP (r = 0.45, P < 0.03). In patients, the only independent 
      variables related to vascular morphology were serum albumin which was inversely 
      related to IMT (P < 0.03) and to plaque (carotid P < 0.05, femoral P < 0.02) and 
      age, which was related to femoral plaque only (P < 0.04). Left ventricular 
      end-diastolic internal dimension, not LVMI, correlated positively with carotid IMT 
      (P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our results show that calcified plaque is common in ESRD 
      patients and hypoalbuminaemia may be an associated factor.

TI  - Serum fetuin-A is associated with the components of MIAC(malnutrition, inflammation, 
      atherosclerosis, calcification) syndrome in different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.3906/sag-1809-43 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Fetuin-A, a circulating inhibitor of calcification, is a marker of 
      inflammatory-nutritional state. We evaluated the association between serum fetuin-A 
      levels and vascular calcification, intima-media thickness, and nutritional and 
      inflammatory markers in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: CKD patients were sampled for calcium-phosphate parameters and 
      nutritional and inflammatory markers [highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)], 
      and serum fetuin-A levels. Intima-media thicknesses of the common carotid arteries 
      (CIMT) were measured. Peripheral artery calcification scores were obtained. RESULTS: 
      A total of 238 patients were included in the study. Fetuin-A levels in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease were significantly lower than those in patients with stage-3 
      and stage-4 CKD (stage-5 vs. stage-4, P < 0.001; stage-5 vs. stage-3, P < 0.001). 
      Fetuin-A was negatively correlated with creatinine (P < 0.001), Ca × P product (P < 
      0.001), hs-CRP (P = 0.01), vascular calcification score (P < 0.001), and CIMT (P < 
      0.001), and positively correlated with BMI (P < 0.001, r = 0.30) and serum albumin 
      (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Lower levels of fetuin-A were associated with higher 
      vascular calcification scores, CIMT, hs-CRP levels, and lower BMI and albumin. 
      Fetuin-A deficiency may be a key element for MIAC syndrome.

TI  - Hemodialysis access placement with preoperative noninvasive vascular mapping: 
      comparison between patients with and without diabetes.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - We retrospectively analyzed data on preoperative vascular mapping in 195 consecutive 
      patients to investigate the common belief that patients with diabetes are poor 
      candidates to have an arteriovenous fistula placed as dialysis access because they 
      lack suitable blood vessels. There was no difference in venous diameter, arterial 
      diameter, and arterial peak systolic velocity measurements between patients with and 
      without diabetes. Patients with diabetes had a greater prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications and greater cuff measurements of systolic segmental arterial 
      pressure. In 140 of 195 patients, subsequent vascular access surgery had been 
      performed in our institution, and 127 of these patients were on hemodialysis therapy 
      at the end of the study period. There was no difference in the prevalence of fistula 
      placement (66% versus 60%; chi-square = 2.6; df = 2; P = 0.28, not significant [NS]) 
      and percentage of functioning fistulae between patients with and without diabetes 
      (67% versus 62%; chi-square = 0.27; df = 1; P = 0.61, NS). The percentage of 
      patients dialyzed through a temporary catheter was equal in patients with and 
      without diabetes (18%). In summary, patients with diabetes seem to be as good 
      candidates for arteriovenous fistula placement as patients without diabetes. 
      Additional studies are required to determine the long-term outcome of fistulae in 
      patients with diabetes.

TI  - Vascular calcification and renal osteodystrophy relationship in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 51-62
AB  - Cardiovascular disease and stroke account for 60-70% of all deaths in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD), at a risk that is 10-20-fold the age- and 
      sex-matched general population. There is also increased coronary artery 
      calcification and increased cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      and dialysis patients compared with the general population. Bone is similarly 
      abnormal in CKD. There is an increased incidence of low bone mass and fractures in 
      dialysis patients compared with the general population. Furthermore, a hip fracture 
      in a dialysis patient is associated with a doubling of the mortality observed in 
      nondialysis patients with a hip fracture. These two problems may be linked, as 
      cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between 
      osteoporosis and coronary artery calcification in the general population and in ESRD 
      patients. In vitro and ex vivo, there is clear evidence that vascular calcification 
      is an active cell-mediated process, made worse by disorders of mineral metabolism. 
      Many factors known to be associated with cardiovascular disease in CKD patients can 
      directly increase calcification in vitro. In addition, in CKD, there are many 
      mechanisms by which bone may adversely affect vascular calcification including 
      disorders of bone remodelling, altered secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
      hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcaemia, use of calcium based binders, and excessive 
      vitamin D therapy. The coexistence of vascular risk factors and abnormal bone 
      represent a double threat to the well being of patients with CKD.

TI  - The role of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use in vitamin K status.
PG  - e0203157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203157 [doi]
LID - e0203157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal 
      disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney 
      transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular calcification. 
      Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by vitamin-K-dependent matrix 
      γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney transplantation or phosphate 
      binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. Therefore, we studied the influence of 
      kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on vitamin K status. METHODS: We 
      measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low 
      vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82), 
      peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n = 
      36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear 
      regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder 
      use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential confounders. 
      RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP levels 
      were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 pmol/L) 
      compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients 
      on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate binder was not associated 
      with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) compared to no phosphate binders 
      (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used sevelamer monotherapy, which was 
      associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist use. CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney 
      transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin 
      K status after transplantation. Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher 
      dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more 
      attention to vitamin K status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for 
      protection against vascular calcification.

PG  - 526-533
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with increased risk of 
      major adverse cardiac events. We hypothesized that MAC, identified on a 
      pretransplant transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), is predictive of cardiac events 
      following renal transplantation (RT). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 
      consecutive RT recipients, pretransplant MAC presence and severity were determined 
      on TTE performed within 1 year prior to transplant. MAC severity was quantified 
      based on the circumferential MAC extension relative to the mitral valve annulus. 
      Post-transplant cardiac risk was assessed using the sum of risk factors (range: 0-8) 
      set forth by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 
      Foundation consensus statement on the assessment of RT candidates. Subjects 
      underwent pretransplant stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial 
      perfusion imaging and followed for post-transplant composite outcome of cardiac 
      death or myocardial infarction (CD/MI). RESULTS: Among 336 subjects (60.5% men; mean 
      age 52 ± 12 years), MAC was present in 78 (23%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 
      3.1 ± 1.9 years, a total of 70 events were observed. Patients with MAC had a higher 
      event rate compared with those without MAC (34.6% versus 17.8%, log-rank P = 0.001). 
      There was a stepwise increase in CD/MI risk with increasing MAC severity (P for 
      trend = 0.002). MAC-associated risk remained significant after adjusting for sex, 
      duration of dialysis, sum of risk factors, ejection fraction and perfusion 
      abnormality burden, providing an incremental prognostic value to these parameters 
      (Δχ2 =4.63; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Among RT recipients, the burden of pretransplant 
      MAC is an independent predictor of post-transplant risk of CD/MI. MAC should be 
      considered in the preoperative assessment of RT candidates.

TI  - Radial augmentation index may be an effective predictor of vascular calcification in 
      patients on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 455-462
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2020.1762646 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is an important promoter of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Several indices can be used to 
      evaluate VC, including the abdominal aortic calcification index (AACI) and carotid 
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT); however, simpler and lesser expensive 
      predictors, such as the radial augmentation index (RAI), should be investigated. A 
      total of 101 patients undergoing PD were recruited to measure RAI, AACI, and carotid 
      artery IMT and perform echocardiography. Fifty healthy controls (HCs) were recruited 
      to undergo RAI measurement. RAI in patients undergoing PD was significantly higher 
      than the RAI in HCs (86.25%±8.39% vs. 76.05%±9.81%, p < 0.05). Patients undergoing 
      PD and who suffer with diabetic mellitus, hypertension, and CVD had more severe VC 
      than those without the abovementioned diseases. In patients with PD, RAI was 
      positively correlated with AACI (r = 0.671, p < 0.05) and carotid artery IMT 
      (r = 0.596, p < 0.05). RAI was positively correlated with left ventricular 
      end-diastolic dimensions (LVDd; r = 0.678, p < 0.05), left ventricular mass index 
      (r = 0.595, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with early-diastolic mitral inflow 
      velocity/late-diastolic mitral inflow velocity (r = -0.342, p < 0.05) and left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (r= -0.497, p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed that RAI was associated with AACI, LVDd, age, and serum phosphate 
      (p < 0.05). RAI might be an effective predictor of VC and cardiac 
      structural/functional abnormalities in patients undergoing PD.

TI  - Serum osteoprotegerin is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness as 
      assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients: a cross 
      sectional study.
PG  - 184

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link 
      between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD 
      patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured 
      using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define 
      the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into 
      tertiles. RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high 
      arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure 
      (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
      (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV 
      value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing 
      tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, 
      respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum 
      calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; 
      OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with 
      cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). 
      CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have 
      greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

TI  - The value of computed tomography-derived coronary artery calcification score in 
      coronary artery disease detection in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 683-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the value of coronary artery calcification (CAC) score in 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) detection in asymptomatic hemodialysis (HD) patients 
      by evaluating the association among CAC score, exercise electrocardiography (EECG), 
      and Thallium-201 dipyridamole scintigraphy. Correlation between aortic pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) and CAC score was also evaluated. METHODS: CAC score was assessed 
      with conventional computed tomography in 40 patients. Thirty patients completed EECG 
      and 25; those with a positive CAC score and/or a positive EECG performed Thallium 
      dipyridamole scintigraphy. Carotid-femoral PWV was assessed in all patients. 
      RESULTS: There was no association among CAC score and EECG or Thallium dipyridamole 
      scintigraphy. In contrast, CAC score was correlated with aortic PWV. CONCLUSION: The 
      previous results question the role of CAC score in the detection of CAD in 
      asymptomatic HD patients. The correlation between CAC score and aortic PWV raises 
      the possibility that CAC score represents more an indicator of coronary artery 
      medial wall calcification than a marker of CAD.

LID - e0241435
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphatemia and calcium load were associated with vascular 
      calcification. The role of calcium-containing phosphate binders (CCPBs) use as 
      important determinants of death and cardiovascular events in predialysis 
      hyperphosphatemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients remain unclear due to the 
      absence of evidence for reduced mortality with CCPB use compared with placebo. We 
      aimed to investigate the effect of using CCPBs or nonuse in all-cause mortality 
      rates and cardiovascular events in CKD stage 5 patients between 2000 and 2005 in the 
      Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. METHODS: Patients with known 
      coronary heart disease and those who had undergone dialysis or renal transplantation 
      were excluded. The CCPB users were matched with nonusers by the propensity score 
      model. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard 
      ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: During a 
      mean follow-up of 4.58 years, 879 CCPB users were matched with 3516 nonusers. CCPB 
      use was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [adjusted hazard ratio 
      (HR) 1.583, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.393-1.799]. The increased cardiovascular 
      risk was dose-dependent and consistent across all subgroup analyses. Compared with 
      no use, CCPB use was associated with no significant all-cause mortality risk (1.74 
      vs. 1.75 events per 100 person-years, adjusted HR 0.964, 95% CI 0.692-1.310). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CCPB use in CKD stage 5 patients was associated with a significantly 
      increased cardiovascular event risk compared with the nonusers, whereas the 
      all-cause mortality risk was similar between the two groups. Whether these 
      relationships are causal require further randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Reduction in Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity Is Associated with a Short-Term Reduction in 
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density T Score.
PG  - 346-350
LID - 10.1159/000501392 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We wished 
      to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with changes in 
      bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: We measured 
      vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and BMD by dual electron 
      absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to compensate for differences in 
      patient ages and gender. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had repeat aPWV measurements 
      and DXA scans, median 12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased in 15 and increased in 9. As 
      there were more women in the group with an increase in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted 
      DXA T scores Total body T scores fell in both groups, but median T scores remained 
      positive for those with an increase in aPWV, whereas negative T scores on both scans 
      for those with a decrease in or stable aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in those 
      with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to 0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 0.05), 
      whereas there was no significant decrease in those with an increase in aPWV (-0.5 
      [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]). There were no changes in femoral neck T 
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothesis of a link between bone 
      disease and vascular disease in dialysis patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging 
      of the aorta and will include aortic calcification, and as such a reduction in 
      lumbar spine T score without a change in femoral neck T score suggests a reduction 
      in aortic calcification. Although our study requires additional confirmation, our 
      data would suggest that changes in aPWV could be used as a surrogate for changes in 
      vascular calcification in the investigation of interventions designed to reduce 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Lower Serum Irisin Levels Are Associated with Increased Vascular Calcification in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1159/000487689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular 
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is prevalent 
      and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex and unclear. 
      We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play roles in vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate serum irisin 
      levels and establish their relation to vascular calcification and other parameters 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 150 patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in 
      this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA. 
      Vascular calcification was evaluated by abdominal aortic calcification scores. 
      RESULTS: Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis 
      patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0) vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, 
      P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively correlated with the parathyroid hormone 
      level (P=0.01). The HD patients with vascular calcification showed significantly 
      lower serum irisin concentrations [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, 
      P<0.01]. Compared with the group without vascular calcification multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were 
      significant independent determinant factors for vascular calcification in HD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Our results are the first to provide a clinical evidence of 
      the association between serum irisin and vascular calcification in HD patients. 
      Lower irisin levels, long-term hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk 
      factors in HD patients.

TI  - [Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone disorder].
PG  - 442-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney disease 
      in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic patients on 
      hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher prevalence of severe and 
      progressive vascular calcification with increased cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. The main factor which causes vascular calcification in patients with 
      diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic control. The recent trial findings 
      describe an inverse correlation between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum 
      levels and glycemic control in a group of diabetic patients on hemodialysis. AIM: 
      The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the laboratory 
      markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on glycemic 
      control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic compensation of 
      diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 
      3rd stage DKD were investigated. There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), 
      average age of patients was 71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l 
      and estimated glomerular filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 
      patients with better glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with 
      poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. 
      Patients were further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH 
      (iPTH < 35 pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis 
      was performed using and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We have found the statistical 
      significance in the serum phosphate and proteinuria levels in between groups with 
      HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 %. Diabetics with better glycemic control had 
      significant reduction in serum phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p 
      = 0.038) and in 24 hrs proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 
      0.007). In the group of presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found 
      the trend towards increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.063) and increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control of 
      diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD. KEY WORDS: diabetes 
      mellitus type 2 (DM2T) - chronic kidney disease (CKD) - mineral and bone disorder

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla Protein, Arterial Stiffness, and Endothelial Function in African 
      American Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 735-741
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vascular calcification inhibitor dependent 
      upon vitamin K for activation. Evidence suggests that elevated plasma inactive MGP 
      levels (desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP, dp-ucMGP; indicating poorer vascular vitamin 
      K status) are associated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Despite 
      African Americans experiencing highest rates of kidney failure and CVD events, 
      relationships between dp-ucMGP and CVD risk markers have not been examined in this 
      population. We investigated vascular vitamin K status (via plasma dp-ucMGP) between 
      African American hemodialysis (HD) patients and healthy controls, and the 
      associations of dp-ucMGP with arterial stiffness and endothelial function in HD 
      patients only. METHODS: In 37 African American HD patients and 37 age- and 
      race-matched controls, plasma dp-ucMGP was measured by enzyme immunoassay as a 
      marker of vascular vitamin K status. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV; 
      arterial stiffness measurement) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD; 
      endothelial function measurement) were assessed by applanation tonometry and 
      ultrasound, respectively, in HD patients only. RESULTS: Mean dp-ucMGP levels were 
      5.6 times higher in HD patients vs. controls (2,139 ± 1,102 vs. 382 ± 181 pmol/l, P 
      < 0.01). Multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, dialysis vintage, 
      diabetes mellitus, CVD history, body mass index, and blood pressure, revealed that 
      dp-ucMGP was independently related to PWV (standardized β = 0.49) and FMD 
      (standardized β = -0.53) (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 
      higher plasma dp-ucMGP concentrations found in African American HD patients may be 
      associated with greater arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

      individuals without known CAD who underwent 64-channel dual-source coronary computed 
      tomography angiography between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled. The patients were 
      divided into six groups based on their diabetes status (nondiabetic or diabetic) and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal renal 
      function; eGFR 60-89, mild CKD; or eGFR 30-59, moderate CKD). We compared the 
      coronary artery calcium score (CACS), segment stenosis score (SSS), and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD among the groups. RESULTS: In nondiabetics, whereas SSS and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD were not different as renal function deteriorated, after adjusting 
      for cardiovascular risk factors, CACS showed a unique developmental pattern: no CACS 
      increase until mild CKD, but abrupt increase from the stage of moderate CKD 
      (moderate vs. normal renal function, adjusted OR 5.118, 95% CI 1.293-20.262, p = 
      0.020). In diabetics, patients from the stage of mild CKD were more likely to have 
      ≥50% obstructive CAD (p = 0.004), higher CACS (p = 0.020), and SSS (p = 0.001) in 
      multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CKD did not have a significant 
      impact on the development of coronary atherosclerosis, but affected the progression 
      of coronary calcification more markedly from the stage of moderate CKD in 
      nondiabetics. However, in diabetics, the deterioration of renal function was 
      significantly associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and 
      calcification from the stage of mild CKD.

TI  - Cardiovascular calcifications in pediatric patients receiving maintenance dialysis.
PG  - 810-3
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adult patients 
      with end-stage renal disease receiving maintenance dialysis. Coronary artery 
      calcifications (CAC) contribute to the high prevalence of cardiac disease and are 
      associated with hyperphosphatemia, an elevated calcium-phosphorus product (CaxP), 
      and prolonged time on dialysis. Chronic inflammation and malnutrition are also 
      associated with an increased risk for development of cardiac calcifications. Young 
      adults receiving maintenance dialysis develop cardiac calcifications at a degree out 
      of proportion to healthy adults of the same age and gender. Many of these young 
      adults initiated dialysis as children or teenagers. Risk factors associated with the 
      development of CAC are also seen in the pediatric dialysis population. To date, 
      reports of cardiac calcifications in pediatric patients receiving maintenance 
      dialysis are limited to post-mortem studies. We present two pediatric patients with 
      ANCA-positive vasculitis diagnosed with cardiac calcifications while receiving 
      maintenance dialysis. Hyperphosphatemia and an elevated CaxP product were seen in 
      both patients and probably contributed to the development of extraskeletal 
      calcifications. In addition, both patients had an underlying systemic inflammatory 
      disease and significant weight loss/malnutrition that may have contributed to the 
      early and rapid onset of cardiac calcifications.

TI  - In-Hospital Outcomes of Chronic Total Occlusion Percutaneous Coronary Intervention 
      in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - E113-E121
LID - JIC2018915-3 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on in-hospital outcomes of 
      chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has received 
      limited study. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of CKD and its impact on CTO-PCI 
      outcomes in 1979 patients who underwent 2040 procedures between 2012 and 2017 at 18 
      centers. CKD was defined as preprocedural estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m². RESULTS: Compared with patients without CKD (n = 1444; 
      73%), patients with CKD (n = 535; 27%) had more comorbidities (hypertension, 
      diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, prior myocardial 
      infarction, PCI, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and stroke), and more severe 
      calcification and proximal vessel tortuosity. Patients with and without CKD had 
      similar technical success rates (84% vs 86%; P=.49) and procedural success rates 
      (83% vs 84%; P=.44). Patients with CKD had higher in-hospital mortality rate (1.9% 
      vs 0.3%; P<.001) and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate 
      (4.3% vs 2.2%; P<.01). In-hospital mortality and MACE rates increased with 
      decreasing eGFR levels (P=.03). In multivariate analysis, an independent association 
      was observed between CKD and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odd ratio, 4.4; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.2-16.0; P=.02), but not overall MACE (adjusted odds ratio, 
      1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.7; P=.28). CONCLUSIONS: CKD is common among 
      patients undergoing CTO-PCI. High success rates can be achieved in patients with 
      decreased glomerular filtration rate, but CKD may be associated with higher 
      in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Uremic Patients with Increased Vascular Calcification Score Have Serum with High 
      Calcific Potential: Role of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Osteoblastic Differentiation 
      and Apoptosis.
PG  - 142-149
LID - 10.1159/000497229 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Uremic patients experience premature vascular ageing that causes 
      cardiovascular morbidity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between 
      uremic serum calcific potential induced by high phosphate (Pi) and vascular 
      calcification score (VCS). METHODS: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were 
      cultured with 3.5 mM Na3PO4 (Pi) with 10% uremic serum and calcium deposition, 
      markers of osteoblastic transformation, and apoptosis were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Culture with uremic serum and high-Pi significantly induced calcification (0.21 ± 
      0.03 vs. 8.05 ± 0.6; ctr vs. Pi; OD/mg protein; p < 0.01). We next stratified 
      patients with respect of the degree of VCS in 2 groups: absence of vascular 
      calcification (VC) "no VC group" and presence of VC "VC group". We found that there 
      was a significant correlation between VCS and uremic serum calcific potential 
      induced by high Pi in vitro (p < 0.01). Interestingly, uremic sera of the "VC group" 
      were more effective than sera from the "no VC group", in downregulating α-actin and 
      SM22α, after treatment with high-Pi (41.3 ± 4.7 vs. 23.3 ± 2.9 and 25.6 ± 6.8 vs. 
      8.14 ± 2.3; VC vs. no VC group, α-actin and SM22α respectively; Δ intensity area; 
      p < 0.01). Similarly, sera from "VC group" were more effective than sera from "no VC 
      group" in adjuvanting the high-Pi effect of increasing osteoblastic markers, such as 
      bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), osteocalcin (OC), and runt-related transcription 
      factor 2 (RUNX2; 39.1 ± 11.3 vs. 5.0 ± 2.6 BMP2; 12.2 ± 4.2 vs. 1.7 ± 0.3 OC; 2.9 ± 
      0.4 vs. 1.2 ± 0.2 RUNX2; VC vs. no VC group respectively; p < 0.05). We found a 
      similar pattern with significantly higher apoptosis and necrosis induction by sera 
      from the "VC group" compared to the "no VC group" (2.05 ± 0.33 vs. 1.29 ± 0.13 and 
      54.1 ± 19.5 vs. 27.4 ± 10.6; Pi; VC group vs. no VC group; enrichment factor of 
      apoptotic or necrotic fragments, respectively; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude 
      that VCS of end-stage renal disease patients significantly correlates with 
      serum-calcific potential induced by high Pi. In addition, uremic patients with 
      higher VCS have sera with a higher potential to induce VSMC osteoblastic 
      trans-differentiation, apoptosis, and necrosis.

TI  - Vascular calcification and bone mineral density in recurrent kidney stone formers.
PG  - 278-85
LID - 10.2215/CJN.06030614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent epidemiologic studies have provided evidence for 
      an association between nephrolithiasis and cardiovascular disease, although the 
      underlying mechanism is still unclear. Vascular calcification (VC) is a strong 
      predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and the hypothesis explored in this study is 
      that VC is more prevalent in calcium kidney stone formers (KSFs). The aims of this 
      study were to determine (1) whether recurrent calcium KSFs have more VC and 
      osteoporosis compared with controls and (2) whether hypercalciuria is related to VC 
      in KSFs. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a retrospective, 
      matched case-control study that included KSFs attending an outpatient nephrology 
      clinic of the Royal Free Hospital (London, UK) from 2011 to 2014. Age- and 
      sex-matched non-stone formers were drawn from a list of potential living kidney 
      donors from the same hospital. A total of 111 patients were investigated, of which 
      57 were KSFs and 54 were healthy controls. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and 
      vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed using available computed 
      tomography (CT) imaging. The prevalence, severity, and associations of AAC and CT 
      BMD between KSFs and non-stone formers were compared. RESULTS: Mean age was 47±14 
      years in KSFs and 47±13 in non-stone formers. Men represented 56% and 57% of KSFs 
      and non-stone formers, respectively. The prevalence of AAC was similar in both 
      groups (38% in KSFs versus 35% in controls, P=0.69). However, the AAC severity score 
      (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile]) was significantly higher in KSFs 
      compared with the control group (0 [0, 43] versus 0 [0, 10], P<0.001). In addition, 
      the average CT BMD was significantly lower in KSFs (159±53 versus 194 ±48 Hounsfield 
      units, P<0.001). A multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, high BP, diabetes, 
      smoking status, and eGFR confirmed that KSFs have higher AAC scores and lower CT BMD 
      compared with non-stone formers (P<0.001 for both). Among stone formers, the 
      association between AAC score and hypercalciuria was not statistically significant 
      (P=0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with calcium kidney 
      stones suffer from significantly higher degrees of aortic calcification than age- 
      and sex-matched non-stone formers, suggesting that VC may be an underlying mechanism 
      explaining reported associations between nephrolithiasis and cardiovascular disease. 
      Moreover, bone demineralization is more prominent in KSFs. However, more data are 
      needed to confirm the possibility of potentially common underlying mechanisms 
      leading to extraosseous calcium deposition and osteoporosis in KSFs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) develop 
      significant vascular calcification early in life, the cause of which is not yet 
      fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney disease have similar vascular 
      calcification, with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in these 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between 
      patients with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether there is a 
      correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and 
      carotid intima-media thickness in patients with HoFH. METHODS: The study was a 
      cross-sectional review involving 30 patients with HoFH attending the Charlotte 
      Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital Lipid Clinic in Parktown, South Africa, as 
      well as 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. FGF23, fasting lipid profiles, 
      calcium, and phosphate were measured. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries 
      was done to assess the extent and severity of arterial calcification. RESULTS: There 
      was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient and control groups 
      (62.07 ± 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 ± 19.84 pg/mL; P = .4621) nor was there any 
      correlation between FGF23 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .9483 and 
      .8474) or total cholesterol (P = .9261 and .859). In the HoFH patients, FGF23 did 
      not correlate significantly with any cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum 
      FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when compared to non-familial 
      hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched controls, and there is no correlation 
      between serum FGF23 and cardiovascular disease in patients with HoFH. FGF23 does not 
      appear to be a major factor for arterial calcification in HoFH.

PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0218-2 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical relevance of 
      aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients. METHODS: Between January 2010 and 
      September 2014, 1221 patients with urolithiasis were treated in Oyokyo Kidney 
      Research Institute and Hirosaki University Hospital. Among these, 287 patients 
      (Stone group) on whom adequate data were available were included in this 
      retrospective study. We also selected 148 subjects with early stage (pT1N0M0) renal 
      cell carcinoma from 607 renal cell carcinoma patients who underwent radical 
      nephrectomy at Hirosaki University Hospital (Non-stone group) as control subjects. 
      Validity of the Non-stone group was evaluated by comparison with pair-matched 296 
      volunteers from 1166 subjects who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project 
      in 2014. Thereafter, age, body mass index, aortic calcification index (ACI), renal 
      function, serum uric acid concentrations, and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, 
      or cardiovascular disease) were compared between the Non-stone and Stone groups. 
      Independent factors for higher ACI and impaired renal function were assessed using 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed relevance of 
      Non-stone group patients as a control subject by comparing the pair-matched 
      community-dwelling volunteers. Backgrounds of patients between the Non-stone and 
      Stone groups were not significantly different except for the presence of 
      hypertension in the Stone group. ACI was not significantly high in the Stone group 
      compared with the Non-stone group. However, age-adjusted ACI was greater in the 
      Stone group than the Non-stone group. Among urolithiasis patients, ACI was 
      significantly higher in uric acid containing stone patients. The number of patients 
      with stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in the Stone 
      group than in the Non-stone group (12% vs. 4%, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis showed higher aortic calcification index (>13%), and being a 
      stone former were independent factors for stage 3B CKD at the time of diagnosis. 
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification and being a stone former had harmful influence on 
      renal function. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN: UMIN000022962.

TI  - Increased Peripheral Arterial Calcification in Patients Receiving Warfarin.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002665 [doi]
LID - e002665
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial 
      calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men is 
      unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral arteries was 
      compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This 
      retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 patients with radiographs performed 
      during or after warfarin therapy who were identified by a computerized search of 
      medical records. Each patient was matched to a patient without warfarin exposure 
      based on age, sex, and diabetes status. Patients with warfarin exposure <1 month, 
      history of end-stage renal disease, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
      Radiographs were reviewed visually for arterial calcification. The prevalence of 
      arterial calcification was 44% greater in patients with versus without warfarin use 
      (30.2% versus 20.9%, P=0.0023) but not on radiographs performed before warfarin 
      therapy (26.4% versus 22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years of warfarin therapy. The 
      increase was noted only in the ankle and foot, was limited to a medial pattern of 
      calcification, and was similar in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is 
      associated with lower extremity arterial calcification in both men and women 
      independent of age, sex, diabetes status, and other patient characteristics. This 
      may have implications for the choice of therapies for long-term anticoagulation.

TI  - Cardiovascular rEmodelling in living kidNey donorS with reduced glomerular 
      filtration rate: rationale and design of the CENS study.
PG  - 123-134
LID - 10.1080/08037051.2019.1684817 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Until recently, it has been believed that donating a kidney not represents 
      any risk for development of cardiovascular disease. However, a recent Norwegian 
      epidemiological study suggests that kidney donors have an increased long-term risk 
      of cardiovascular mortality. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking reduced 
      kidney function to cardiovascular disease are not known. Living kidney donors are 
      screened for cardiovascular morbidity before unilateral nephrectomy, and are left 
      with mildly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after donation. Therefore, they 
      represent an unique model for investigating the pathogenesis linking reduced GFR to 
      cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular remodelling. We present the study design 
      of Cardiovascular rEmodelling in living kidNey donorS with reduced glomerular 
      filtration rate (CENS), which is an investigator-initiated prospective observational 
      study on living kidney donors. The hypothesis is that living kidney donors develop 
      cardiovascular remodelling due to a reduction of GFR.Materials and methods: 60 
      living kidney donors and 60 age and sex matched healthy controls will be recruited. 
      The controls will be evaluated to fulfil the Norwegian transplantation protocol for 
      living kidney donors. Investigations will be performed at baseline and after 1, 3, 6 
      and 10 years in both groups. The investigations include cardiac magnetic resonance 
      imaging, echocardiography, bone density scan, flow mediated dilatation, laser 
      Doppler flowmetry, nailfold capillaroscopy, office blood pressure, 24-h ambulatory 
      blood pressure, heart rate variability and investigation of microbiota and 
      biomarkers for inflammation, cardiovascular risk and the calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.Conclusions: The present study seeks to provide new insight in the

TI  - Study of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders in newly detected advanced 
      renal failure patients: A Hospital-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - 874-885
AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected, untreated 
      predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a tertiary care 
      hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational study. A total of 95 
      (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent clinical evaluation, 
      biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
      albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25- hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any abnormality including 
      fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular calcification (CVC)]. 
      Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 33.6% of the study 
      patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 
      hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. CVC was seen in 
      22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly involving the mitral valve. Patients 
      with CVC were more likely to be males and smokers. There was no significant 
      difference in iPTH levels between patients with or without CVC. AAC was seen in 
      10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray. Patients with AAC had higher levels of 
      iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels of calcium compared to patients without 
      AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in 41.05% of our patients and was more 
      prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 
      25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that newly detected, naïve Indian CKD patients have 
      a high prevalence of disturbances of mineral metabolism including 
      hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, abnormal BMD, and valvular and vascular 
      calcification, even before initiating dialysis.

TI  - Kidney Graft Salvage Strategies for Vascular Complications During Kidney 
      Transplantation: A Single-center Experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney-related unknown vascular injuries are rare and usually diagnosed 
      only after reperfusion. Hemorrhage that makes in situ reconstruction impossible can 
      lead to graft loss. In an era of organ shortage and an increasing number of patients 
      on the waiting list for transplantation, a kidney graft salvage procedure consisting 
      of graft nephrectomy, reperfusion, reconstruction, and reimplantation should be 
      undertaken whenever possible as a contribution to extending the organs available for 
      transplantation. METHODS AND PATIENTS: From January 2010 to December 2015, in total 
      five patients suffered from intraoperative or immediate postoperative vascular 
      complication and were included for this retrospective analysis. Age, sex, etiology 
      of kidney failure, delayed graft function, kind of vascular complications and 
      therapy, presence of aortoiliac calcification, cold and warm ischemia time, and 
      length of hospital stay were analyzed. RESULTS: By applying this "one-step-back" 
      procedure in three consecutive patients and a structured in situ repair in two 
      patients, all grafts were saved. Two of five patients developed delayed graft 
      function requiring hemodialysis. At discharge, graft function was excellent in all 
      five patients. Reconstructed vasculature showed 100% patency. CONCLUSION: These 
      graft salvage strategies are safe with excellent outcome and should be considered in 
      the event of an acute vascular complication during kidney transplantation.

TI  - Urine albumin and serum uric acid are important determinants of serum 25 
      hydroxyvitamin D level in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 540-546
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1563552 [doi]
AB  - Low serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH D) is common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. This cross-sectional study is looking for the different factors associated 
      with serum 25 OH D among pre-dialysis CKD. 1624 adult stage 3-5 CKD patients were 
      studied beside 200 normal control subjects. All candidates were tested for body mass 
      index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), parathormone (PTH), 25 OH D, albumin, and uric acid (UA), and urine 
      albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Multivariate linear regression analysis was done to 
      determine predictors of 25 OH D. 98.6% of CKD patients have inadequate level of 25 
      OH D vs 48% of normal subjects. Serum 25 OH D was significantly lower in CKD 
      patients (mean ± S.D = 16.54 ± 5.8 vs 37.79 ± 3.58 ng/mL for CKD vs control group 
      respectively, p < .001). Serum level of 25 OH D has significant positive correlation 
      with Ca (r = 0.337, p < .001), and significant negative correlation with P, PTH, UA, 
      and ACR (r = -0.440, -0. 679, -0.724, and -0.781respectively, p < .001 in all). The 
      independent predictors of 25 OH D were Ca, P, UA, PTH, and ACR (R square = 0.7, 
      β = -0.087, -0.226, -0.313, -0.253, and -0.33 respectively, p < .001 in all). In 
      conclusion, pre-dialysis CKD patients frequently suffer low 25 OH D. Among the 
      different abnormalities related to CKD, urine albumin excretion rate and UA are the 
      most important predictors of 25 OH D in these patients.

TI  - Relationship between Fetuin A, Vascular Calcification and Fracture Risk in Dialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - e0158789
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158789 [doi]
LID - e0158789
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures are a common morbidity that lead to worse outcomes in dialysis 
      patients. Fetuin A inhibits vascular calcification (VC), potentially promotes bone 
      mineralization and its level positively correlates with bone mineral density in the 
      general population. On the other hand, the presence of VC is associated with low 
      bone volume in dialysis patients. Whether the fetuin A level and VC can predict the 
      occurrence of fractures in dialysis patients remains unknown. METHODS: We performed 
      this prospective, observational cohort study including 685 dialysis patients (629 
      hemodialysis and 56 peritoneal dialysis) from a single center in Taiwan for a median 
      follow-up period of 3.4 years. The baseline fetuin A level and status of presence of 
      aortic arch calcification (VC) and incidence of major fractures (hip, pelvis, 
      humerus, proximal forearm, lower leg or vertebrae) were assessed using adjusted Cox 
      proportional hazards models, recursive partitioning analysis and competing risk 
      models. RESULTS: Overall, 177 of the patients had major fractures. The incidence 
      rate of major fractures was 3.29 per 100 person-years. In adjusted analyses, the 
      patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels had a lower incidence of fractures 
      (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.18‒0.5, fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 
      and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34‒0.78, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1). The presence of aortic 
      arch calcification (VC) independently predicted the occurrence of fractures 
      (adjusted HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.34‒2.84) as well. When accounting for death as an 
      event in competing risk models, the patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels 
      remained to have a lower incidence of fractures (SHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17‒0.56, 
      fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32‒0.81, tertile 2 vs. tertile 
      1). INTERPRETATIONS: Lower baseline fetuin A levels and the presence of VC were 
      independently linked to higher risk of incident fractures in prevalent dialysis 
      patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are common and 
      frequently coexist. Among subjects with CKD, arterial disease may be due to 
      atherosclerosis, medial arterial calcification (MAC), or both conditions 
      concomitantly. It is important for clinicians to recognize both conditions because 
      each identifies individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and 
      because the presence of MAC complicates interpretation of the ankle brachial index, 
      the most commonly used diagnostic test for artherosclerotic PAD. To that end, we 
      review the epidemiology and diagnosis of atherosclerotic PAD and medical arterial 
      calcification in patients with CKD.

TI  - Infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries: 
      two-year results.
PG  - 6-15; discussion 15-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Although severe, circumferential calcification of distal outflow vessels is 
      frequently encountered, its effect on bypass graft patency rates has not been well 
      established. METHODS: Using a computerized vascular registry database, we conducted 
      a retrospective review of 1957 bypass grafts with distal anastomoses to 
      infrapopliteal vessels performed at a single institution between 1990 and 1995. Of 
      these cases, 101 procedures involved outflow arteries classified by the operating 
      surgeon as severely calcified and unclampable (requiring intraluminal occluders for 
      vascular control), whereas in 105 cases the outflow arteries had no calcification 
      present at the distal anastomotic site. The remaining cases had varying intermediate 
      degrees of calcification and were not analyzed. Indication for bypass procedure was 
      limb-threatening ischemia in 90% of severe calcification cases and in 84% of cases 
      without calcification. Atherosclerotic risk factors were similar except for the 
      presence of diabetes (92% vs 74%, p < 0.001), creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl (21% vs 
      8%, p < 0.01), and dialysis dependency (17% vs 3%, p < 0.001), all of which were 
      more prevalent in the severe calcification group. Infrapopliteal distal anastomotic 
      location and type of conduit ( > 90% autogenous vein) were comparable between 
      groups. RESULTS: Primary patency, secondary patency, and foot salvage rates at 24 
      months were 60%, 65%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 74%, 82%, and 
      93% for the no calcification group, respectively. With secondary procedures 
      comprising 26% of cases in each group, data from the 150 primary procedures were 
      reanalyzed separately. In this primary procedure group, 24-month primary patency, 
      secondary patency, and foot salvage rates were 66%, 69%, and 77% for the severe 
      calcification group and 84%, 90%, and 96% for the no calcification group, 
      respectively. Although patency and salvage rates were consistently lower for the 
      severe calcification group in all analyses, these differences did not achieve 
      significance by log-rank life-table analysis at 2-year follow-up. Perioperative 
      30-day mortality (0.99% severe calcification vs 0.95% no calcification) and 24-month 
      survival rates (84% severe calcification vs 83% no calcification) were also similar 
      between groups. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that effective techniques exist to 
      perform infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries 
      with results comparable with those obtained with clampable, uncalcified vessels. The 
      finding of severe, circumferential calcification of outflow target arteries should 
      not dissuade vascular surgeons from distal bypass for limb salvage indications.

TI  - Chemoradiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer exacerbates thoracic aortic 
      calcification determined by computed tomography.
PG  - 1401-1408
LID - 10.1007/s00380-020-01611-2 [doi]
AB  - Preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) has been considered as an effective 
      treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. However, there is concern that CRT 
      progresses atherosclerosis in cancer survivors. This study sought to determine if 
      preoperative CRT exacerbated thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) detected by 
      computed tomography (CT) in patients with lung cancer. Among 473 patients who 
      underwent surgery for lung cancer at Okayama University Hospital between 2011 and 
      2015, 34 patients undergoing preoperative CRT and surgery (CRT group) and 33 matched 
      patients undergoing initial surgery (non-CRT group) were analyzed and compared. The 
      volume of TAC between the 2nd and 12th thoracic vertebrae was quantitatively 
      measured by CT at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Patients in the CRT group 
      (62 ± 7 years old, 74% male) received cisplatin chemotherapy with docetaxel or 
      vinorelbine and radiation therapy (mean 47.3 ± 4.0 Gy). The percent change in TAC 
      volume was significantly greater in the CRT compared with the non-CRT group (58.7%, 
      95% confidence interval [CI] 41.7-75.7% vs. 27.2%, 95% CI 9.9-44.4%; p = 0.01). 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified CRT as an independent factor 
      associated with greater TAC progression (> the median value) (odds ratio 3.63, 95% 
      CI 1.19-11.08; p = 0.02). In conclusion, preoperative CRT for lung cancer 
      exacerbates TAC. Follow-up of such patients should thus include careful longitudinal 
      assessment for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Predicts Less Coronary Artery Calcification and Diabetic Kidney 
      Disease Over 12 Years in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The CACTI Study.
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.2337/dc18-1527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between serum 
      uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal 
      protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during 
      2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes of 
      24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and after 
      a mean follow-up period of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion was defined 
      as ACR ≥30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year), and impaired GFR as 
      eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SUMOD was measured on stored baseline plasma samples 
      (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam computed tomography. 
      CAC progression was defined as a change in the square root-transformed CAC volume of 
      ≥2.5. RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level conferred lower odds of CAC progression 
      (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97), incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 
      0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56; 0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 0.24-0.83) 
      per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 ng/mL) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, 
      systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD 
      to models with traditional risk factors also significantly improved the prediction 
      performance for CAC progression and incident DKD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD 
      level predicted lower odds of both CAC progression and incident DKD over 12 years in 
      adults with type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process 
      similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects the 
      aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic 
      valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender, 
      diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact cellular and 
      molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. Late-stage 
      cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional imaging modalities 
      such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, these modalities are 
      limited in their ability to detect the development of early calcification and the 
      progression of calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due 
      to the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment is 
      usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need to understand 
      the process of calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging 
      modalities which are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This 
      review focuses on the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of 
      cardiovascular calcification.

TI  - Serum sclerostin levels are positively related to bone mineral density in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 266

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus 
      integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a potential 
      contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), which 
      has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular calcification. The 
      positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density (BMD) has been 
      demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between sclerostin and BMD in PD 
      patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were enrolled; their sera were collected 
      for measurement of sclerostin and other CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also 
      assessed simultaneously. We examined the relationship between sclerostin and each 
      parameter through Spearman correlation analysis and by comparing group data between 
      patients with above- and below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and multiple 
      logistic regression models were employed to define the most predictive of sclerostin 
      levels in the above-median category. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that 
      sclerostin was correlated with spine BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score 
      (r = 0.274, P = 0.010), spine BMD Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH; r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. 
      High BMD, old age, male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high 
      osteocalcin and uric acid levels were observed in patients with high serum 
      sclerostin levels and an inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin. 
      Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively 
      correlated with above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P = 0.002); 
      the correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 121.5, 
      P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a positive 
      association between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD population.

      Study.
PG  - 264-276
LID - 10.1159/000499645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies on the long-term clinical benefits of hemodiafiltration 
      (HDF) and high-flux hemodialysis (HFHD) are very limited. This study aimed to 
      investigate the hospitalization rate and aortic arch calcification (AAC) of these 
      two dialysis modalities over 6 years. METHODS: Participants who received regular HDF 
      and HFHD in one hospital-facilitated hemodialysis center were prospectively enrolled 
      after matching for age, sex, and diabetes between January 2009 and December 2014. 
      Medical records were reviewed retrospectively on demographics, laboratory variables, 
      calcified scores in aortic arch measured by chest radiography, and rates of hospital 
      admission. Cox proportional hazard regression and linear regression were used to 
      obtain the outcome results. RESULTS: The HDF and HFHD groups consisted of 108 and 
      102 participants, respectively. Levels of laboratory variables including small 
      soluble solutes and Kt/V were not statistically different over the 6-year period 
      between the HDF and HFHD groups. Calcified scores of the aortic arch increased over 
      6 years in both groups. The changes in the mean calcified scores were significant 
      when compared between the two groups (0.44-1.82 in HFHD, 0.79-1.8 in HDF, 
      respectively, p = 0.008). Hospitalization rates were 735 per 1,000 patients in the 
      HDF group and 852 per 1,000 patients in the HFHD group, respectively. No significant 
      difference was observed in frequency and days of hospitalization between HDF and 
      HFHD. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates and AAC were observed to be equal for HDF 
      and HFHD.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification independently predicts 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to 
      evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification 
      (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal 
      transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large 
      multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry. METHODS: 
      Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study 
      of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 
      27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were 
      derived. RESULTS: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. 
      Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The 
      overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and 
      ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After 
      adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood 
      pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total 
      of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between 
      average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 
      32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and 
      blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, 
      systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were 
      associated with TAC progression. CONCLUSIONS: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors 
      were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence 
      and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for 
      coronary calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis is associated with higher rate of aortic valve calcification 
      and higher cardiovascular mortality. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
      is an established alternative for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in 
      patients with higher and intermediate co-morbidities including dialysis. METHODS: 
      Two independent investigators systematically searched Medline, Cochrane, and Web of 
      Science. The ROBINS-I tool was used to analyze and assess the bias from the selected 
      studies. RESULTS: The search resulted in 4 observational studies with a total of 966 
      patients. TAVR in dialysis patients was associated with no significant difference in 
      in-hospital mortality [8.1% vs 10.3%; OR (95% CI) 0.74 (0.35, 1.60), I2 = 50%, 
      P = 0.45], risk-of-strokes at 30 days [2% vs 4.4%; OR (95% CI) 0.49 (0.22, 1.09), 
      I2 = 0%, P = 0.08], vascular complications [12.7% vs 13.2%; OR (95% CI) 0.96 (0.55, 
      1.67), I2 = 0%, P = 0.89], need of blood transfusion [43.1% vs 66.4%; OR (95% CI) 
      0.27 (0.05, 1.39), I2 = 89%, P = 0.12], or bleeding risk [5.6% vs 6.8%; OR (95% CI) 
      0.91 (0.18, 4.64), I2 = 5%, P = 0.91] when compared to SAVR. TAVR was associated 
      with significantly shorter length of stay [8.5 days vs 14.2 days; mean difference 
      (95% CI) -5.89 (-9.13, -2.64), I2 = 76%, P < 0.0001] and higher pacemaker 
      implantation [11.4% vs 6.8%; OR (95% CI) 1.74 (1.07, 2.81), I2 = 5%, P = 0.02]. 
      CONCLUSION: TAVR outcomes were comparable to SAVR but had a significantly shorter 
      length of stay and a higher pacemaker implantation rate in dialysis patients.

TI  - Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial calcification score in 
      type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 24

LID - 24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is 
      associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest that 
      metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, metformin's 
      effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been characterized. The 
      present study investigated the association between metformin use and lower-limb 
      arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular 
      risk. METHODS: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with 
      type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee 
      calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by colour 
      duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully collected from 
      the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. Biochemical and 
      clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors. RESULTS: 
      Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification score than 
      metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 4684 ± 9291, 
      respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated 
      with a significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial 
      calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the use of other 
      antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like 
      peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the 
      association between metformin use and calcification score (odds ratio [95% 
      confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, 
      tobacco use, renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, 
      neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA(1c) levels, and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently associated with a lower 
      below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This association may contribute to 
      metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective 
      investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in patients with and 
      without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the first leading cause of death in 
      hemodialysis patients. In this population, cardiovascular calcifications occur at an 
      earlier age and progress faster than in general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 
      order to determine the prevalence and risk factors of cardiac calcifications, 49 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis were screened in the coronary arteries and cardiac 
      valves by the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT and the transthoracic echocardiography. 
      Different clinical and biological parameters were studied by the SPSS 10.0 
      statistical software to determine risk factors. RESULT: Cardiac calcifications were 
      identified in 81.6% of cases in at least one of the two studied sites. The coronary 
      artery involvement was more common than valvular and concerned 69.4% of cases. The 
      mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (ACACS) was 331.1 and 522.2 in coronary 
      patients and was correlated to alteration of systolic function of LV (r=-0.287, 
      P=0.045). The severity of CACS was positively correlated with age (r=0.332, P=0.02). 
      Coronary calcifications were associated with cardiovascular risk common to those of 
      the general population (age, male sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, history of 
      ischemic heart disease), but also to a lesser quality of dialysis. Valvular 
      calcifications were present in 49% of cases and were correlated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (P=0.006). The exclusive involvement of the aortic valve was 
      the most common valvular abnormality. Phosphocalcic and lipid parameters, levels of 
      hemoglobin, CRP and uric acid did not predisposed to cardiac calcifications in our 
      patients. DISCUSSION: In hemodialysis patients, the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
      calcification is complex and cannot be attributed to a passive process. This process 
      involves several factors that can promote or inhibit calcification. The new 
      multi-slice ultra-fast scanner is a very sensitive method for topographic and 
      quantitative assessment of coronary calcification and is a better alternative to 
      invasive techniques. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high prevalence of cardiac 
      calcification in hemodialysis, and highlights the importance of early screening and 
      treatment of predisposing factors.

AB  - Gender differences exist in clinical outcomes after routine percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI), but studies reporting such outcomes after chronic total 
      occlusion (CTO) PCI are limited. We assessed the characteristics and outcomes of 
      female patients undergoing CTO PCI. We retrospectively analyzed a dedicated national 
      (United Kingdom) prospective CTO database from 2011 to 2015 for outcomes and 
      characteristics of female patients undergoing CTO PCI (unmatched and propensity 
      matched). Female patients constituted 20.5% (n = 260 of 1,271) of the unmatched 
      cohort and 33.3% (n = 233 of 699) of the matched cohort and were more likely to be 
      older (women aged >70 years, 48% in the unmatched and 45% in the matched cohort). An 
      increased inhospital complication rate was observed in female patients (unmatched: 
      10% women vs 4.45% men, p = 0.0012, and matched 9.87% women vs 3.86% men, p = 
      0.0032). Coronary perforation, bleeding, and contrast-induced nephropathy were more 
      frequently observed in female patients. Femoral access site with >6 French sheath 
      was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Presence of calcification in the 
      CTO artery was associated with coronary perforation (grade III) in female patients 
      in the matched cohort (p = 0.007). Female patients undergoing CTO PCI were older and 
      experienced increased of inhospital complications. Increased awareness of these 
      complications could influence the selection of access site and sheath size, the need 
      for prehydration, judicious choice of balloon size, collateral selection, and wire 
      placement in female patients undergoing CTO PCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) and intradialytic hypotension (IDH) indicate 
      morphological and functional disorders of the cardiovascular system in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes 
      remain undetermined. METHODS: HD patients (n=443) whose plain chest radiographs were 
      examined for aortic arch VC were included. IDH was defined as nadir systolic blood 
      pressure <90mmHg or need for bolus fluid. We investigated the relationship between 
      VC and IDH, and their clinical significance for cardiovascular events (CVEs) and 
      death. RESULTS: VC was found in 57 HD patients (12.9%). IDH was more prevalent in 
      patients with VC compared with those without VC (35.1% vs. 18.7%; P=0.004). VC was 
      independently associated with a 2.12-fold increase in the risk of IDH (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.36). In multivariate analysis, compared with 
      patients with neither VC nor IDH, the coexistence of VC and IDH was independently 
      associated with death (hazard ratio [HR], 3.83; 95% CI, 1.62-9.08) and CVE (HR, 
      3.77; 95% CI, 1.53-9.33), whereas VC or IDH alone was not. Patients with both VC and 
      IDH had the highest risk for a composite event (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.79-7.08). 
      Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and IDH (P for 
      interaction=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: VC was independently associated with IDH. 
      Coexistence of VC and IDH was associated with higher risk of death and CVEs than 
      either factor alone. There was a synergistic interaction between VC and IDH for the 
      risk of a composite event.

TI  - The Correlation of Serum Osteoprotegerin with Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk 
      Factors and Arterial Stiffness in Patients with Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: 
      Results from the KNOW-CKD Study.
PG  - e322

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays protective roles against the development of 
      vascular calcification (VC) which greatly contributes to the increased 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present 
      study aimed to find the non-traditional, kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors 
      correlated to serum OPG and the effect of serum OPG on the arterial stiffness 
      measured by brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in patients with the 
      pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed the data from the patients 
      in whom baPWV and the serum OPG were measured at the time of enrollment in a 
      prospective pre-dialysis CKD cohort study in Korea. RESULTS: Along with traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, pulse pressure, and 
      baPWV, non-traditional, kidney-related factors such as albuminuria, plasma level of 
      hemoglobin, total CO(2) content, alkaline phosphatase, and corrected calcium were 
      independent variables for serum OPG in multivariate linear regression. Reciprocally, 
      the serum OPG was positively associated with baPWV in multivariate linear 
      regression. The baPWV in the 3rd and 4th quartile groups of serum OPG were higher 
      than that in the 1st quartile group after adjustments by age, sex and other 
      significant factors for baPWV in linear mixed model. CONCLUSION: Non-traditional, 
      kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors in addition to traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors were related to serum level of OPG in CKD. Serum OPG level was 
      significantly related to baPWV. Our study suggests that kidney-related factors 
      involved in CKD-specific pathways for VC play a role in the increased secretion of 
      OPG into circulation in patients with CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT01630486.

TI  - Association of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 with Death and Atherosclerotic 
      Events in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 395-405
LID - 10.1159/000488806 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 -(MCP-1), a marker of inflammation 
      and monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques, is associated with 
      cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Although 
      plasma levels are elevated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), associations with 
      reduced kidney function or outcomes in CKD have not been explored. METHODS: In this 
      population-based, probability-sampled, longitudinal cohort of 3,257 participants, 
      including 286 (8.8%) patients with CKD, we studied the association of plasma MCP-1 
      with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, death, and 
      intermediate and hard CV outcomes in CKD and non-CKD individuals. Cox proportional 
      hazards regression assessed associations of baseline MCP-1 with all-cause death and 
      atherosclerotic events. RESULTS: MCP-1 was higher in CKD than non-CKD participants 
      (p < 0.001), and negatively associated with eGFR (r = -0.23, p < 0.0001) but not 
      albuminuria in CKD. MCP-1 was associated with pulse wave velocity and coronary 
      artery calcification in non-CKD but not CKD individuals. At 13.5 years, there were 
      230 (7.7%) deaths and 168 (6.4%) atherosclerotic events in the non-CKD vs. 97 
      (34.0%) deaths and 62 (27.9%) events in the CKD group (p < 0.001 for each). MCP-1 
      was associated with death (hazards ratio [HR] 2.0 [1.4-2.9] per log-unit increase) 
      and atherosclerotic events (1.7 [1.0-2.9]) in CKD individuals. The HR for death in 
      CKD remained significant (1.6 [1.1-2.3]) after adjusting for CV risk factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although plasma MCP-1 increased with decreased eGFR, it remained an 
      independent risk factor for death in CKD. MCP-1 did not correlate with intermediate 
      CV outcomes, implicating pathways other than atherosclerosis in the association of 
      MCP-1 with death in CKD.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the feasibility, procedural and clinical outcomes after 
      implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) in patients with calcified 
      lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the feasibility of BVS implantation and 
      procedural outcomes in patients with and without calcific lesions. The primary 
      outcome was angiographic and procedural success. Secondary outcomes included major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Of 163 patients, 62 (38%) had calcified 
      lesions. Patients with calcific lesions had a higher prevalence of diabetes (35.5% 
      vs. 22.8%, p=0.078) and chronic kidney disease (31.1% vs. 13.9%, p=0.008), and 
      higher SYNTAX scores (18.9±9.7 vs. 15.1±9.0, p=0.017). Calcific lesions required 
      longer procedures (126.4±39.8 vs. 106.9±37.1 min, p=0.015), more frequent use of 
      dedicated devices and IVUS. Acute gain (1.83±0.6 vs. 1.86±0.6, p=0.732) and 
      angiographic success were similar (98% non-calcific vs. 95.2% calcific, p=0.369), 
      whereas procedural success was reduced in patients with calcific lesions (94.1% vs. 
      83.9%, p=0.034) due to higher rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) (5% 
      vs. 13.1%, p=0.067). During the median follow-up time of 14 months MACE rates (10.9% 
      non-calcific vs. 12.9% calcific, plog-rank=0.546) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Treating calcific lesions with BVS is feasible with high angiographic success rates, 
      at the expense of longer procedure times, aggressive lesion preparation and 
      increased rates of periprocedural MI.

TI  - Atherogenesis in renal patients: a model of vascular disease?
PG  - 93-107
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is associated with 
      accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold increased risk of 
      cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients die from complications directly 
      attributed to atherosclerosis and their life expectancy is decreased. Established 
      risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Age, gender, 
      smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are among the established 
      risk factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders (e.g. small dense low 
      density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative stress represent emerging 
      risk factors. The precise mechanism of atherosclerosis in patients with kidney 
      failure is not yet known. CKD might represent a clinical model of atherogenesis. 
      Thus, the evidence obtained from investigating "renal" atherogenesis could be of 
      interest in improving our understanding of this disease process in the non-renal 
      population. We review the relationship between "renal" and non-renal atherosclerosis 
      focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical events and how they interact 
      with treatment options. Overall, the "later" stages of CKD may eventually be 
      considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent condition.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 is a strong predictor of insulin resistance among 
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 226-230
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455594 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is very common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism (MBD) seems to play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is evolving 
      as the most important link between MBD and many pathologic sequences of CKD. The aim 
      was to evaluate IR in pre-dialysis CKD patients looking for a possible association 
      to mineral metabolism among CKD patients. A total of 100 stage 3-5 CKD patients were 
      selected beside 20 normal control subjects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess IR in selected cases. Both groups were 
      compared for fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FBI), HOMA-IR, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25 
      hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH vit D), parathormone (PTH), and uric acid (UA). Correlation 
      study between HOMA_IR and different studied parameters was performed. HOMA-IR is 
      significantly higher in CKD (8.87 ± 3.48 vs. 3.97 ± 0.34 in CKD vs. control, 
      respectively, p < .001). In addition CKD patients have significantly higher FGF23 
      (235 ± 22.96 vs. 139 ± 12.3 pg/mL, p < .001), PTH (76.9 ± 15.27 vs. 
      47.9 ± 2.52 pg/mL, p < .001), P (4.3 ± 0.67 vs. 3.6 ± 0.23 mg/dL, p < .001), and UA 
      (5 ± 1.22 vs. 4.85 ± 0.48 mg/dL, p < .001) and significantly lower Ca (8.2 ± 0.3 vs. 
      8.9 ± 0.33 mg/dL, p < .001), and 25 (OH) vit D (17 ± 5.63 vs. 37 ± 3.43 ng/mL, 
      p < .001). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that BMI, GFR, Ca, P, and 
      FGF23 were the only significant predictors of HOMA IR. Increased IR in CKD is a 
      consequence of the uremic status and is intimately associated with disturbed 
      phosphate metabolism and FGF23. Further studies are needed to look for an underlying 
      mechanism.

      disease.
PG  - F1302-11

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the present 
      study, we investigated the potential involvement of endothelial microparticles (MPs) 
      and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the generation of VC in CKD patients. The 
      number of circulating EMPs is greater in patients with VC than without VC (307 ± 167 
      vs. 99 ± 75 EMPs/μl, P < 0.001). The percentage of EPCs is significantly lower in 
      patient with VC than in patients without VC (0.14 ± 0.11% vs. 0.25 ± 0.18%, P = 
      0.002). The number of EPCs expressing osteocalcin (OCN) was higher in VC patients 
      (349 ± 63 cells/100,000) than in non-VC patients (139 ± 75 cells/100,000, P < 0.01). 
      In vitro, MPs obtained from CKD patients were able to induce OCN expression in EPCs 
      from healthy donors; the increase in OCN expression was more accentuated if MPs were 
      obtained from CKD patients with VC. MPs from CKD patients also induced OCN 
      expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. In CKD patients, the 
      rise in endothelial MPs associated with a decrease in the number of EPCs, suggesting 
      an imbalance in the processes of endothelial damage and repair in CKD patients, 
      mainly those with VC. Our results suggest that EPCs, through OCN expression, may 
      directly participate in the process of VC.

AB  - Renal artery calcium (RAC) has been shown to be associated with higher odds of 
      hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence and 
      extent of RAC is associated with renal function. We analyzed cross-sectional data 
      from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). A subsample of 1,226 
      participants underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and also had venous blood 
      samples measured for kidney function. RAC was the primary predictor variable and the 
      following measures of kidney function were the outcome variables: estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. The analyses were adjusted for age, gender, 
      race, height, visceral fat, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, 
      interleukin-6 and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). The average age of this cohort was 
      66.1 years (SD 9.7), 44.8% (549 of 1,226) were men, and nearly 30% had RAC >0. 
      Compared with those with no RAC, those with RAC >0 were significantly older but not 
      different by gender or race. After adjustment for age, gender, and race, those with 
      RAC >0 had significantly higher visceral fat, were more likely to have dyslipidemia, 
      diabetes, and hypertension, had a higher interleukin-6, and a higher prevalence of 
      AAC >0. The mean eGFR and UACR among those without RAC were 80 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 
      21 mg/g, whereas these values were 78 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 55 mg/g among those with 
      RAC. In fully adjusted multivariable linear regression models, the presence of RAC 
      was associated with a lower eGFR (β = -2.21, p = 0.06) but not with UACR (β = 0.02, 
      p = 0.79). In fully adjusted ordinal logistic regression, RAC as a continuous 
      variable was associated with increased odds of being in a worse CKD category (odds 
      ratio 1.14, p = 0.05). When measured by eGFR and CKD stage, there is a modest 
      relation between RAC and kidney function. Further studies might involve clinical 
      trials to assess the role of intensive cardiovascular disease risk factor management 
      in patients with subclinical RAC to determine if this may prevent or delay the 
      development and progression of CKD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the association between abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) and renal function of living kidney donors and evaluate AAC as a 
      surrogate marker for nephrosclerosis. METHODS: Between January 2010 and March 2013, 
      287 donors who underwent living donor nephrectomy were enrolled. We analyzed 
      computed tomography angiographies and quantified AAC scores by calculating the 
      Agatston score for the abdominal aorta. The donors were stratified into the non-AAC 
      group (AAC score = 0; n = 238) and the AAC group (AAC score >0; n = 49). The 
      relationship between AAC and perioperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was 
      analyzed. For the 180 donors consenting to implantation biopsy, the nephrosclerosis 
      score was defined as the sum of abnormalities, including glomerulosclerosis, tubular 
      atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis. RESULTS: The mean AAC score 
      was 185.5 ± 263.3 in the AAC group. The AAC group was older than the non-AAC group 
      (51.1 ± 6.1 vs 37.9 ± 11 years; P < .001). Perioperative renal function was not 
      different between the 2 groups. However, among the AAC group, donors with an AAC 
      score of >100 were associated with delayed renal function recovery (P = .035). 
      Donors with AAC were more likely to have glomerulosclerosis (50.0% vs 29.1%; P = 
      .022), tubular atrophy (62.5% vs 33.1%; P = .002), and a higher nephrosclerosis 
      score (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Living donors with an AAC score of >100 require close 
      observation because they have a higher probability of delayed renal function 
      recovery after donation. AAC is associated with nephrosclerosis in healthy adults.

TI  - Aortic stiffness and calcification in men in a population-based international study.
PG  - 473-7
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aortic stiffness, a hallmark of vascular aging, is an independent risk 
      factor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The association of aortic 
      stiffness with aortic calcification in middle-aged general population remains 
      unknown although studies in patients with end-stage renal disease or elderly 
      subjects suggest that aortic calcification is an important determinant of aortic 
      stiffness. The goal of this study was to examine the association of aortic 
      calcification and stiffness in multi-ethnic population-based samples of relatively 
      young men. METHODS: We examined the association in 906 men aged 40-49 (81 Black 
      Americans, 276 Japanese Americans, 258 White Americans and 291 Koreans). Aortic 
      stiffness was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) using an 
      automated waveform analyzer. Aortic calcification from aortic arch to iliac 
      bifurcation was evaluated using electron-beam computed tomography. RESULTS: Aortic 
      calcium score was calculated and was categorized into four groups: zero (n=303), 
      1-100 (n=411), 101-300 (n=110), and 401+ (n=82). Aortic calcification category had a 
      significant positive association with cfPWV after adjusting for age, race, and mean 
      arterial pressure (mean (standard error) of cfPWV (cm/s) from the lowest to highest 
      categories: 836 (10), 850 (9), 877 (17) and 941 (19), P for trend <0.001). The 
      significant positive association remained after further adjusting for other 
      cardiovascular risk factors. The significant positive association was also observed 
      in each race group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aortic calcification can 
      be one mechanism for aortic stiffness and that the association of aortic 
      calcification with stiffness starts as early as the 40s.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic renal disease (CKD) is a determinant of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), which is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, in a 
      population without CKD, the association between CAC and renal function is unclear. 
      CAC is affected by sex. This study aimed to determine whether serum cystatin C, a 
      sensitive marker of kidney function, or sex differences are associated with CAC in 
      patients without CKD. METHODS: We evaluated 456 consecutive patients (61±13 years, 
      42% women) without CKD and evidence of coronary artery disease. The CAC (Agatston) 
      score was examined by multidetector computed tomography. RESULTS: When patients were 
      categorized into three CAC groups based on the Agatston score, mild (<10), moderate 
      (11-399), and severe (≥400) in each sex, serum cystatin C levels gradually increased 
      by severity of CAC in women, but not men. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis showed that, in women, a cut-off value of 0.97mg/l for cystatin C 
      discriminated patients with severe CAC with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 
      77% (area under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p<0.01). Multivariate logistic 
      analysis showed that serum cystatin C was not associated with severe CAC in all 
      patients and men, but this association was observed in women (OR: 7.80 for cystatin 
      C≥0.97mg/l, 95% CI: 1.76-34.6, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C levels 
      are associated with greater CAC in women without CKD. Measurement of cystatin C may 
      be useful for identifying women who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Uremia accelerates atherosclerosis, but little is known about affected pathways in 
      human vasculature. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed arterial 
      transcripts in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Global mRNA expression 
      was estimated by microarray hybridization in iliac arteries ( n = 14) from renal 
      transplant recipients and compared with renal arteries from healthy living kidney 
      donors ( n = 19) in study 1. Study 2 compared nonatherosclerotic internal mammary 
      arteries (IMA) from five patients with elevated plasma creatinine levels and age- 
      and sex-matched controls with normal creatinine levels. Western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry for selected proteins were performed on a subset of study 1 
      samples. Fifteen gene transcripts were significantly different between the two 
      groups in study 1 [fold changes (FC) > 1.05 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 
      0.005]. Most upregulated mRNAs associated with cellular signaling, apoptosis, 
      TNFα/NF-κB signaling, smooth muscle contraction, and 10 other pathways were 
      significantly affected. To focus attention on genes from genuine vascular cells, 
      which dominate in IMA, concordant deregulated genes in studies 1 and 2 were examined 
      and included 23 downregulated and eight upregulated transcripts (settings in study 
      1: FC > 1.05 and FDR < 0.05; study 2: FC > 1.2 and P < 0.2). Selected deregulated 
      gene products were investigated at the protein level, and whereas HIF3α confirmed 
      mRNA upregulation, vimentin showed upregulation in contrast to the mRNA results. We 
      conclude that arteries from CKD patients display change in relatively few sets of 
      genes. Many were related to differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. 
      These identified genes may contribute to understanding the development of arterial 
      injury among patients with CKD.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether epicardial fat volume (EFV) is related to coronary 
      artery calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease(CKD). Method: 
      Multi-slice computed tomography was performed in 30 healthy subjects and 120 
      patients with CKD. Cross-sectional tomographic cardiac slices from base to apex were 
      traced semi-automatically using a Volume Viewer of AW4.3 off-line workstation, and 
      EFV was measured by assigning Hounsfield units ranging from -250 to -30 HU to 
      fat.The coronary artery calcification score was assessed by CaScoring software. High 
      density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) 
      and collecting the body mass index (BMI), dialysis route, history of diabetes and 
      coronary artery disease were used to analyze the relationship between EFV and other 
      risk factors in patients with CKD. Results: There were 60.8%(73/120) male (mean age 
      62.8 years) and 39.2%(47/120) female (mean age 66.6 years) in the patients cohort, 
      73.3%(88/120) patients had coronary artery disease, 55.8%(67/120) had diabetes, 21 
      patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 9 on hemodialysis. EFV was apparently 
      higher in stage 4-5 D CKD group compared with the control group((140.03±54.71), 
      (145.01±64.56)and (141.45±62.04) cm(3) vs.(92.42±39.56)cm(3), P=0.007, 0.015 and 
      0.001), was similar between CKD3 and control group, and EFV was significantly higher 
      in peritoneal dialysis group than in hemodialysis group and in coronary artery 
      disease group compared with no coronary artery disease group((140.67±70.31) cm(3) 
      vs.(105.22±61.49) cm(3), P=0.002). EFV was obviously higher in diabetes group than 
      no diabetes group((148.41±65.78) cm(3) vs.(110.53±62.37) cm(3), P=0.007). CACS was 
      apparently increased in stage 3-5 CKD group compared with the control group(140.0 
      vs.4.3, P<0.001). (3)When the patients were divided into four groups according to 
      the eGFR, EFV was positively associated with CACS(r(s)=0.539, P=0.004) in control 
      group, and the association become more robust in patients with CKD5(r(s)=0.841, 
      P<0.000 1). EFV was related to age(r=0.662, P=0.005), BMI(r=0.648, P=0.009)and 
      HDL-C(r=-0.433, P=0.024), but not related to eGFR and LDL-C. EFV was related to 
      CACS(r=0.427, R(2)=0.182 3, P<0.001). CACS was positively correlated to age and BMI 
      (all P<0.05)and negatively correlated with eGFR(P<0.05). Conclusions: Measurement of 
      EFV may provide another useful noninvasive indicator of coronary artery 
      calcification in CKD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the outcomes of patients who presented with 
      non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent orbital 
      atherectomy for severe coronary artery calcification (CAC). BACKGROUND: Patients who 
      present with NSTEMI have increased risk for death and recurrent MI after 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with severe CAC have worse 
      outcomes after PCI.Orbital atherectomy modifies calcified plaque, facilitating stent 
      delivery and optimizing stent expansion. There are no data on these patients who 
      present with NSTEMI who undergo orbital atherectomy. METHODS: Of the 454 consecutive 
      real-world patients who underwent orbital atherectomy in our retrospective 
      multicenter registry, 51 patients (11.2%) presented with NSTEMI. The primary safety 
      endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 
      30days. RESULTS: Patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of chronic kidney 
      disease, lower mean ejection fraction, and required more vessels to be treated. The 
      primary endpoint was similar in patients who presented with and without NSTEMI (2.0% 
      vs. 2.2%, p=0.9), as were the 30-day rates of death (2.0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.67), MI (0% 
      vs. 1.2%, p=0.42), target vessel revascularization (0% vs. 0%, p>0.91), and stroke 
      (0% vs. 0.2%, p=0.72). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis 
      rate were low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having worse baseline 
      characteristics, patients who presented with NSTEMI and subsequently underwent 
      orbital atherectomy had similar clinical outcomes compared with patients without 
      NSTEMI.

TI  - Vascular calcifications and renal osteodystrophy in chronic hemodialysis patients: 
      what is the relationship between them?
PG  - 1179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11255-010-9841-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are 
      frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, 
      but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our 
      study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD 
      patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between 
      VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients. METHODS: We 
      examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 
      81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis. RESULTS: We 
      found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC 
      (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear 
      regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum 
      albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment 
      with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations 
      between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D 
      treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. CONCLUSION: There seems 
      to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. 
      Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium 
      salts are risk factors for VCs.

TI  - High-grade proteinuria as a cardiovascular risk factor in renal transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - 1170-3
LID - S0041-1345(15)00210-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.10.062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteinuria is a marker of graft damage and is closely associated with a 
      higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant 
      recipients (KTRs). Arterial stiffness is a well-known predictor of vascular 
      calcification and systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate 
      the association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to determine 
      whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular disease in our KTR 
      population. METHODS: Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 ± 11 years, with 45.9 ± 9.6 
      months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in the 3 to 5 years 
      of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All patients were evaluated for 
      their standard clinical (age, sex, and duration of hemodialysis) parameters. 
      High-grade proteinuria was defined as proteinuria >500 mg/day in the 24-hour urine 
      collection. All patients were evaluated by means of pulse-wave velocity (PWV) 
      measurement at the initiation of the study. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 
      groups: group 1 (high-grade proteinuria) patients with ≥500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and 
      group 2 (low-grade proteinuria) patients with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60). High-grade 
      proteinuria was correlated with higher PWV measurements and lower estimated 
      glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria appears to precede the elevation of serum 
      creatinine and thus may be a useful marker of renal injury and may also be a 
      contributing factor on deterioration of the graft. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade (>500 
      mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly associated with poor graft survival and 
      increased risk of cardiovascular events. In our study, we proved the significant 
      difference between high-grade and low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 
      mg/day as the threshold of proteinuria in KTR population.

TI  - Foot gangrene in patients with end-stage renal disease: a case control study.
PG  - 355-61
AB  - The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD) is high, with an annual risk of amputation estimated at 13%, and 
      indications for limb revascularization in patients combining ESRD with stage IV PAD 
      (foot gangrene) are still controversial. This case-controlled study compared 
      survival, limb salvage, and quality of life in a group of patients hospitalized for 
      foot gangrene according to their renal status (ESRD versus no renal insufficiency). 
      All patients with ESRD hospitalized for foot gangrene (n = 16) from 1996 to 2002 
      were compared with a control group with normal creatininemia (n = 24) hospitalized 
      for foot gangrene due to peripheral atherosclerotic arterial disease. The 2 groups 
      were matched for age, sex ratio, and number with diabetes mellitus. After a mean 
      follow-up of 467 +/-410 days, patients with ESRD had a more severe prognosis as 
      regards mortality (68.7% vs 12.5%, p = 0.0005) and major amputation (31% versus 8%, 
      p = 0.09). The ESRD group was characterized by more frequent extensive arterial 
      calcifications (16/16 vs 13/24, p = 0.002), owing to a higher level of the calcium 
      phosphorus product (3.54 +/-1.2 vs 2.4 +/-0.6, p = 0.0023), and by impaired 
      microcirculatory perfusion, as indicated by a lower oxygen pressure (TcPO(2)) (15.6 
      +/-12 mm Hg vs 26 +/-16, p = 0.07). ESRD implies a poor prognosis in patients with 
      stage IV peripheral arterial disease.

TI  - Arterial micro-calcification of vascular access is associated with aortic arch 
      calcification and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 216-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2012.01113.x [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification of the coronary arteries or aorta is an independent risk 
      factor for cardiovascular outcome, but clinical significance of arterial 
      micro-calcification (AMC) of vascular access is unclear in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Sixty-five patients awaiting vascular access operation were enrolled. We 
      compared surrogate markers of cardiovascular morbidity such as aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) by chest radiography, arterial stiffness by brachial-ankle 
      pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and endothelial dysfunction by flow-mediated dilatation 
      (FMD) between patients with and without AMC of vascular access on von Kossa 
      staining. AMC of vascular access was detected in 36 (55.4%). The AMC-positive group 
      had significantly higher incidence of AoAC (63.9% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001) and higher 
      baPWV (26.5 ± 9.4 m/s vs. 19.8 ± 6.6 m/s, p = 0.006) than the AMC-negative group. 
      There was no significant difference in FMD between the two groups (5.4 ± 2.6% vs. 
      5.7 ± 3.5%, p = 0.764). The AMC-positive group had higher incidence of diabetes 
      mellitus, higher systolic blood pressure and wider pulse pressure than the 
      AMC-negative group. This study suggests that AMC of vascular access may be 
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity via AoAC and arterial stiffness in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Coronary artery diameter and left ventricular function in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment: comparison between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining 
      left ventricular function by evaluating coronary artery diameter in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis treatment. METHODS: We studied 
      12 diabetic and 12 nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment 
      without significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries. Patients 
      were matched for age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis and incidence of major 
      coronary risk factors. Left ventricular wall thickness (septal and posterior walls) 
      and left ventricular diameter (end-diastolic and systolic phases), were measured by 
      echocardiography. Hemodynamic measurements and coronary angiography were performed 
      on the day of hemodialysis and coronary artery diameter at the proximal and mid 
      portion of three major coronary arteries were measured using the computed 
      densitometry method. RESULTS: Right and left anterior descending and circumflex 
      coronary artery diameters were all significantly smaller and the frequency of 
      coronary artery calcification was higher in diabetic (58%) compared to nondiabetic 
      (8%) patients. Although there were no significant differences in left ventricular 
      wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, mean right atrial pressure and cardiac 
      index between the two groups, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 
      significantly higher in diabetic (22 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared to nondiabetic patients 
      (14 +/- 5 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Despite that there were no significant stenoses of the 
      major epicardial coronary arteries, diffuse luminal narrowing of the epicardial 
      coronary arteries in diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment was 
      associated with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

TI  - Prevalence of vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality in 
      warfarin treated hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 248-58
AB  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization and 
      the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla protein 
      MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 
      387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. 
      Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared 
      with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L 
      vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients 
      had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 
      48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), 
      with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with 
      increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, 
      p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and 
      total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In 
      univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of 
      all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those 
      untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the 
      significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In 
      hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit 
      ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and 
      increased mortality.

TI  - Cutaneous calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a regulated 
      process associated with in situ osteopontin expression.
PG  - 900-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calcification, or calcinosis cutis (CC), is found in 
      approximately 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic 
      dialysis. While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it may be similar to those 
      for medial and intimal vascular calcifications, which are actively regulated 
      processes. OBSERVATION: In a retrospective study of 9 patients, the role of an 
      active calcification process leading to CC was assessed by the immunohistochemical 
      detection of osteopontin, which is a regulator of osseous and extra-osseous 
      calcification processes. Calcinosis cutis was associated with female sex, vascular 
      comorbidity, inconstant secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of plasma 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Six patients had a favorable outcome after the lowering 
      of plasma calcium levels during dialysis or after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Calcinosis of the vascular media of subcutaneous vessels was the most common 
      histologic feature and was always associated with osteopontin staining, suggesting 
      that CC is a regulated process. Moreover, to our knowledge, extravascular staining 
      of osteopontin in sweat glands, nerves, and macrophages was demonstrated for the 
      first time in this study.

TI  - Impact of chronic kidney disease on carotid plaque vulnerability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on 
      plaque morphology in cerebral vessels. We therefore analyzed plaque composition and 
      metabolic and chemical parameters with regard to clinical outcome in patients with 
      advanced carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and normal or impaired renal function. 
      METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy plaques were collected from 114 patients, 51 with 
      CKD and 63 without CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 49 ± 9 vs 88 ± 14 
      mL/min), and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of matrix 
      metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -9), calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone, fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin, and inflammatory factors, including fibrinogen, 
      and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by appropriate 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Compared with patients without CKD, 
      patients with CKD had significantly more early-stage (11.2% vs 2.8%, P = .002) and 
      end-stage (7.4% vs 0.2%, P = .036) calcification, unstable (50.8% vs 20.4%, P = 
      .001) and ruptured (53.1% vs 32.8%, P = .035) lesions, and a significantly lower 
      amount of collagenous fibers (39.2% vs 54.6%, P = .001). Serum samples of CKD 
      patients had significantly enhanced levels of fibrinogen (393 ± 88 vs 331 ± 60 
      mg/dL, P = .018), hsCRP (1.7 ± 2.9 vs 0.8 ± 0.9 mg/dL; P = .042), parathyroid 
      hormone (47.3 ± 24.1 vs 32.8 ± 12.2 ng/L, P = .010), fetuin-A (0.21 ± 0.05 vs 0.18 ± 
      0.04 mg/mL, P = .039), and MMP-7 (13.0 ± 5.3 vs 8.3 ± 3.0 ng/mL; P < 0.001). The 
      incidence of cerebrovascular events >6 months before carotid surgery was 
      significantly increased in CKD patients (84.0% vs 26.2% P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with CKD and advanced carotid artery stenosis, morphologic changes in 
      plaque composition may contribute to plaque vulnerability and consequently to the 
      risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, relevant serum markers of inflammation, 
      vascular calcification, and vessel wall degradation might be an indication of stroke 
      risk in CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes of calcification scores of the abdominal aorta (CSAA) after 
      total parathyroidectomy plus autotransplantation (TPX + AT) for symptomatic 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SSHP) have never been reported. METHODS: Forty-nine 
      patients who successfully underwent TPX + AT for SSHP were enrolled; 13 patients who 
      had regular hemodialysis were enrolled as controls. Preoperatively, patients' age, 
      gender, and duration of dialysis were recorded. Serum Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase 
      (Alk-ptase), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), vitamin D, FGF23, and Klotho levels, 
      and CSAA were measured. One year postoperatively, these data were measured again. In 
      the control group, these data were recorded and measured before and one year later. 
      RESULTS: Serum iPTH, Alk-ptase and FGF23 levels and CSAA of the study group were 
      significantly higher than those of the control group. One year postoperatively, 
      serum Ca, P, Alk-ptase, iPTH, and FGF23 levels and CSAA were significantly lower 
      than those before surgery. Except for FGF23 levels, other items of the control group 
      did not change significantly one year later, whereas the study group decreased CSAA 
      more than the control group. CONCLUSION: One year postoperatively, CSAA decreased.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate of Fetuin-A and Pentraxin3 
      (PTX3) as the main factors for vascular calcification and inflammation in 
      hemodialysis (HD) and renal transplant (RT) patients. METHOD: Serum was obtained 
      from 45 stable chronic HD patients and 44 stable RT recipients. Biochemical factors, 
      intact Parathormone, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Fetuin-A and PTX3 
      levels were determined by standard methods. RESULTS: In the RT recipients PTX3 level 
      was significantly higher than the HD patients [5.78(1.09-20.36) ng/mL vs. 
      1.65(0.24-7.89) ng/mL, p ≤ 0.001]. Serum Fetuin-A concentration was significantly 
      higher in the HD compared to RT group [43.39(27.75-81.48) ng/mL vs. 
      38.76(22.26-89.07) ng/mL, p=0.020]. hsCRP level was also higher in the HD than the 
      RT group [2.90(0.1-8.50) mg/L vs. 1.1(0.1-7.9) mg/L, p=0.003]. CONCLUSION: Although 
      our study shows that serum PTX3 is increased and Fetuin-A is decreased after 
      successful RT, their direct role on atherosclerosis needs further studies in the 
      future.

TI  - POEMS syndrome and calciphylaxis: an unrecognized cause of abnormal small vessel 
      calcification.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s13023-016-0421-3 [doi]
LID - 35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, 
      thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients. However, there have been several case reports on calciphylaxis in patients 
      with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin 
      changes) syndrome, a systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and 
      upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). METHODS: In 76 POEMS 
      patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small 
      vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and 
      laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS patients with and without 
      calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases. RESULTS: 
      Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of 
      the controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. 
      Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and 
      ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was 
      associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine, 
      calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. 
      Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 may 
      contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different mechanism from 
      that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause 
      of calciphylaxis.

AB  - The progression of coronary atherosclerosis has been influenced by the presence of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the impact of CKD stages on 
      coronary plaque components observed on optical coherence tomography (OCT). We 
      investigated 296 native coronary lesions with stable angina pectoris treated with 
      stent implantation. All lesions were divided into the three groups according to the 
      values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)): the 
      non-CKD group (eGFR ≥60, n = 142), CKD group (15 ≤ eGFR < 60, n = 126), and 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) group (eGFR <15 and/or hemodialysis, n = 28). Among 
      the groups, plaque morphologies at the narrowest culprit sites on OCT were 
      evaluated. The CKD group had a larger lipid arc [207.5 (88.3-264.5) vs. 159.3 
      (73.3-227.7) degrees, P = 0.037] and longer lipid length [2.4 (0.0-5.7) vs. 0.0 
      (0.0-4.7) mm, P = 0.017] than the non-CKD group. The ESKD group had a thinner 
      fibrous cap [120 (70-258) vs. 170 (100-270) μm, P = 0.044], higher prevalence of 
      plaque rupture (28.6 vs. 12.3 %, P = 0.038), and larger calcification arc [124.8 
      (0.0-194.3) vs. 0.0 (0.0-125.4) degrees, P = 0.025] than the non-ESKD group 
      (CKD + non-CKD groups). The presence of CKD was related to the growth of lipidic 
      plaques. Furthermore, the advancement in the CKD stage to ESKD affected the 
      occurrence of plaque rupture or progression of calcification.

TI  - Risk factors associated with coronary artery calcification should be examined before 
      kidney transplantation.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney 
      transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher incidence 
      of cardiovascular events compared with general population. Cardiovascular risk 
      factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of patients starting dialysis 
      or kidney transplantation already have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery 
      calcification is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions 
      and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 
      stable renal transplant recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk 
      factors associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and 
      quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients 
      and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were 
      significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients 
      without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than 
      those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 
      23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients 
      died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC 
      score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with 
      atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.

TI  - Visceral Adipose Tissue and Leptin Hyperproduction Are Associated With Hypogonadism 
      in Men With Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypogonadism is a common endocrine disorder in men with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), but its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We here explore the 
      plausible contribution of abdominal adiposity and leptin hyperproduction to 
      testosterone deficiency in this patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis 
      with all men included the Malnutrition, Inflammation and Vascular Calcification 
      cohort, which enrolled consecutive nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3-5. 
      SUBJECTS: A total of 172 men with CKD stages 3-5 nondialysis (median age 61 [45-75] 
      years, median glomerular filtration rate 24 [9-45] mL/min/1.73 m(2)). In them, serum 
      levels of total testosterone, estrogen, sex hormone binding globulin, and leptin 
      were quantified, together with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by thoracic and 
      abdominal CT scan. INTERVENTION: None, observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Total testosterone, hypogonadism. RESULTS: The median level of total testosterone 
      was 11.7 (7.3-18.4) nmol/L, with hypogonadism (<10 nmol/L) present in 52 (30%) 
      patients. Testosterone-deficient patients presented with significantly higher body 
      mass index, waist circumference, and VAT. An inverse correlation between 
      testosterone and VAT (rho = -0.25, P = .001) or waist circumference (rho = -0.20, 
      P = .008) was found, also after multivariate adjustment including sex hormone 
      binding globulin and estrogen. Total testosterone was inversely correlated with 
      serum leptin (rho = -0.22, P = .003), and the ratio of leptin/VAT, an index of 
      leptin hyperproduction, was strongly and independently associated with the 
      prevalence of hypogonadism in multivariable regression analyses. CONCLUSION: 
      Visceral adiposity independently associated with lower testosterone levels among men 
      with CKD stage 3-5 nondialysis. The observed link between hyperleptinemia and 
      hypogonadism is in line with previous evidence on direct effects of leptin on 
      testosterone production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommendations concerning 
      screening for VC differ. Possible ability to prevent and reversibility of VC are 
      major subjects on debate whether screening for VC could improve outcomes of renal 
      patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the significance of simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) based on plane radiographic films and to test 
      its association with non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients on chronic HD. 
      METHODS: A study population consisted of 95 prevalent HD patients in the HD unit of 
      Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health sciences Kaunas Clinics. Clinical data 
      and laboratory tests information were collected from medical records. SVCS was 
      evaluated as it is described by Adragao et al. After measurement of VC, HD patients 
      were observed for novel non-fatal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Patients were 
      divided into two groups: SVCS≥3 (57 patients [60%]) and <3 (38 patients [40%]). The 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a significant difference in non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events in the group with SVCS≥3 vs. <3 group (26.3% vs. 7.8%; log 
      rank 5,49; P=0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed a negative 
      impact of VC, hyperphosphatemia, and lower ejection fraction on cardiovascular 
      events. No statistically significant differences were observed comparing parameters 
      of Ca-P metabolism disorders between groups with different SVCS. On separate 
      analysis, the presence of VC in hands was also associated with higher rate of novel 
      cardiovascular events (score 0 goup-5 events [10.6%] vs. score≥1 group-13 events 
      [27%], log rank P=0.035). CONCLUSION: VC assessed by simple and inexpensive 
      radiological method was an independent predictor of novel non-fatal cardiovascular 
      events in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciprotein particles (CPPs) may play an important role in the 
      calcification process. The calcification propensity of serum (T50) is highly 
      predictive of all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease patients. Whether T50 is 
      therapeutically improvable, by high-flux hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration 
      (HDF), has not been studied yet. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional single 
      center study, and included stable prevalent in-center dialysis patients on HD or 
      HDF. Patients were divided into two groups based on dialysis modality, were on a 
      thrice-weekly schedule, had a dialysis vintage of > 3 months and vascular access 
      providing a blood flow rate > 300 ml/min. Calcification propensity of serum was 
      measured by the time of transformation from primary to secondary CPP (T50 test), by 
      time-resolved nephelometry. RESULTS: We included 64 patients, mean convective volume 
      was 21.7L (SD 3.3L). In the pooled analysis, T50 levels increased in both the HD and 
      HDF group with pre- and post-dialysis (mean (SD)) of 244(64) - 301(57) and 253(55) - 
      304(61) min respectively (P = 0.43(HD vs. HDF)). The mean increase in T50 was 26.29% 
      for HD and 21.97% for HDF patients (P = 0.61 (HD vs. HDF)). The delta values (Δ) of 
      calcium, phosphate and serum albumin were equal in both groups. Baseline T50 was 
      negatively correlated with phosphate, and positively correlated with serum magnesium 
      and fetuin-A. The ΔT50 was mostly influenced by Δ phosphate (r = -0.342; P = 0.002 
      HD and r = -0.396; P<0.001 HDF) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: HD and HDF patients 
      present with same baseline T50 calcification propensity values pre-dialysis. 
      Calcification propensity is significantly improved during both HD and HDF sessions 
      without significant differences between both modalities.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome 
      influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and 
      dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only 
      a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older 
      studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy 
      in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease 
      (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a 
      Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) 
      and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and 
      specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between 
      nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, 
      and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone 
      mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic 
      bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. 
      Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and 
      bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these 
      patients.

TI  - Comparison of complications with a 1.25-mm versus a 1.5-mm burr for severely 
      calcified lesions that could not be crossed by an intravascular ultrasound catheter.
PG  - 227-233
LID - 10.1007/s12928-019-00606-9 [doi]
AB  - Since intravascular imaging such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can provide 
      useful information for rotational atherectomy (RA), intravascular imaging should be 
      attempted before RA. However, some calcified lesions do not allow imaging catheters 
      to cross before RA. Although small burrs (1.25 mm or 1.5 mm) should be selected for 
      such tight lesions, it is unknown whether a 1.25-mm burr or 1.5-mm burr is safer as 
      the initial burr. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of 
      complications with a 1.25-mm versus a 1.5-mm burr as the initial burr for 
      IVUS-uncrossable lesions. This was a retrospective, single-center study. A total of 
      109 IVUS-uncrossable lesions were included, and were divided into a 1.25-mm group 
      (n =52) and a 1.5-mm group (n =57). The incidence of slow flow just after RA was not 
      different between the 2 groups (1.25-mm group: 25%, 1.5-mm group: 31.6%, P =0.45). 
      The incidence of peri-procedural MI with slow flow was not different and equally low 
      in the 2 groups (1.25-mm group: 1.9%, 1.5-mm group: 3.5%, P =0.61). The use of the 
      1.5-mm burr as the initial burr was not significantly associated with slow flow 
      after controlling for chronic renal failure on hemodialysis and reference diameter 
      (vs. 1.25-mm: OR 2.34, 95% CI 0.89-6.19, P =0.09). In conclusion, the incidence of 
      complications following RA was comparable between the 1.25-mm and the 1.5-mm burrs 
      as the initial burr for IVUS-uncrossable lesions. The present study provides 
      insights into the selection of an appropriate burr for IVUS-uncrossable lesions.

TI  - Association of conjunctival and corneal calcification with vascular calcification in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and easily 
      detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
      calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone metabolism 
      parameters in dialysis patients. METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30 men, 33 
      women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were on dialysis therapy for more than 6 
      months. Forty-four patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients were on 
      hemodialysis therapy. The same observer evaluated the presence of CCC by using a 
      slit-lamp microscope, and a total CCC score was recorded for each patient. Fifty-two 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls also were evaluated by using the same method. 
      Biochemical data were collected from patient files. Bone mineral density (BMD) of 
      the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured, and the presence of vascular 
      calcification was assessed by using x-ray examinations of the pelvis and hands. 
      RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly higher than that in controls 
      (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC score correlated significantly with 
      duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s = 0.392; P = 0.002), serum phosphorus 
      level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium x phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 
      0.007). However, we did not find a significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The 
      frequency of vascular calcification was significantly greater in patients with a 
      high CCC score (CCC score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% 
      versus 5.6%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and 
      noninvasive method. It seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to 
      assess the status of extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

PG  - 1425-9
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2015.1077316 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which increases 
      morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is thrombosis, due to 
      flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. This occurs not only 
      due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones related to vascular 
      atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has developed a simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification and arterial 
      stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic procedures for VA 
      surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive power for the detection of 
      stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of systemic factors, especially SCVS, on 
      Qa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained 
      with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated 
      correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were recorded and 
      non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with them. RESULTS: Pearson's 
      corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851 (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied 
      significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p = 0.021), SCVS (p = 0.030), 
      intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa 
      varied significantly with diabetes status (p = 0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA 
      status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time 
      (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters did 
      not change the flow values. CONCLUSION: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower 
      DU-Qas, giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a 
      simple method like SVCS may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations 
      accordingly to risk stratification.

AB  - We studied the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcification in people 
      with early chronic kidney disease. We used a cohort of 562 adult patients with 
      chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 
      ml/min/1.73 m(2), in a community-based study of people without clinical 
      cardiovascular disease, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The majority had 
      stage 3 disease. Coronary artery calcification was measured at baseline and again 
      approximately 1.6 or 3.2 years later. The prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification at baseline was 66%, and its adjusted prevalence was 24% lower in 
      African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The incidence of coronary artery 
      calcification was 6.1% per year in women and 14.8% in men. Coronary artery 
      calcification progressed in approximately 17% of subjects per year across all 
      subgroups, and diabetes was associated with a 65% greater adjusted risk of 
      progression. Male gender and diabetes were the only factors associated with adjusted 
      coronary artery calcification incidence and progression, respectively. Our study 
      shows that coronary artery calcification is common in people with stage 3 disease, 
      progresses rapidly, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Data regarding characteristics of young patients with mitral annular calcification 
      (MAC) and its associations with other cardiovascular risk factors are scarce. Hence, 
      we sought to characterize patients aged <50 years with MAC and to examine whether in 
      these patients, MAC is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Consecutive 
      patients who underwent an echocardiographic study were prospectively entered into a 
      database. The database included clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic 
      parameters. The present study included 56 patients aged <50 years with a diagnosis 
      of MAC. The mean age was 44.2 ± 6.9 years with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1. The 
      prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (30 patients [53%] hypertension, 17 
      patients [30%] diabetes mellitus, 24 patients [43%] dyslipidemia, 22 patients [39%] 
      smoking) and established cardiovascular disease (22 patients [39%] coronary artery 
      disease, 11 patients [19%] previous stroke) was substantially higher than expected 
      for this age group. Twenty-nine patients (52%) had chronic kidney disease. Of these, 
      18 patients (62%) had end-stage kidney disease and 7 patients (24%) underwent renal 
      transplantation. Fourteen patients (25%) and 3 patients (5%) had moderate or severe 
      mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis, respectively. Aortic valve disease was 
      present in 37 patients (66%). Moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction and 
      left ventricular hypertrophy were identified in 9 patients (16%) and 31 patients 
      (56%), respectively. In conclusion, the detection of MAC in a young patient should 
      be regarded as a marker of atherosclerotic disease, chronic kidney disease, and 
      aortic valve disease.

TI  - Different risk factors for peripheral vascular calcification between diabetic and 
      non-diabetic haemodialysis patients--importance of glycaemic control.
PG  - 1446-8
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been 
      emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic 
      haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are 
      not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between 
      haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: We examined 421 patients 
      on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II 
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62+/-10 years old) 
      and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59+/-13 years old). Hand 
      roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of the hand 
      arteries was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic 
      patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in 
      diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) ( 
      p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of 
      haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower 
      predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular 
      calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of haemodialysis. In 
      diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk of calcification by 
      2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have shown 
      that poor glycaemic control, rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a 
      predictor of peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on 
      haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in 
      diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.

PG  - 67-72

AB  - Cardiovascular mortality in kidney transplant recipients has shown to be 
      substantially elevated particularly in the first year of transplantation. Complex 
      ventricular arrhythmia (VA) has been pointed as one of the etiologies of sudden 
      death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of VA and to investigate 
      the factors associated with their occurrence in incident kidney transplant 
      recipients. A total of 100 incident kidney transplant recipients were included in 
      the study (39.7 ± 10.1 years, 55% male, 43.6 ± 10.1 days of transplantation, 66% 
      living donors). All the patients underwent 24 h electrocardiogram, echocardiogram 
      and multi-slice computed tomography. Thirty percent of the patients had VA. Left 
      ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 57% of the patients while heart failure was 
      found in 5%. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was observed in 26 patients, from 
      which 31% had severe calcification. The group of patients with VA was predominantly 
      male, had been on dialysis therapy for a longer time and had more coronary 
      calcification. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, male gender and CAC 
      score were independently associated with the presence of VA. In conclusion, kidney 
      transplant recipients exhibited a high prevalence of VA and the factors associated 
      with its occurrence were the male gender and the presence of CAC.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the distribution of coronary artery calcium 
      score (CACS) by age group and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and to evaluate the 
      association between CV risk factors and CACS classification in asymptomatic adults. 
      The study included 31,545 asymptomatic Koreans, over 20 years of age with no 
      previous history of malignancy, proven coronary artery disease, or stroke, who 
      underwent CACS computed tomography at the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical 
      Center, between January 2005 and June 2013. Mean (±SD) age was 53.8 (±8.5) years 
      overall, 56.1 (±8.3) in men, and 53.3 (±8.5) in women. They were classified into 
      five groups based on their resting CACS: none (CAC = 0), minimal (0 < CAC ≤ 10), 
      mild (10 < CAC ≤ 100), moderate (100 < CAC ≤ 400), and extensive (400 > CAC). Older 
      age groups exhibited higher CACS values. The proportion of CACS classification in 
      our study was 55.5 % with no CACS, 9.5 % with minimal CACS, 19.8 % with mild CACS, 
      10.8 % with moderate CACS, and 4.3 % with extensive CACS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 
      were calculated for CV risk factors to determine their association with CACS. When 
      analyzed according to sex, in males, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with the 
      presence of hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, chronic kidney 
      disease, and smoking status. While, in females, the adjusted OR for CACS increased 
      with the presence of HT, DM, and obesity. CV risk factors appear to be significantly 
      associated with CACS in the Korean population.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This cross-sectional study was designed to assess the relationship 
      between vascular stiffness (VS) and bone-related proteins involved in the 
      development of arteriosclerosis in patients on regular hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: 
      68 consecutive patients in stable clinical condition who received regular HD in the 
      FMC Dialysis Center, Pécs were included. VS parameters (carotid-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity - PWV, aortic augmentation index - AIx) were determined by applanation 
      tonometry (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sidney) and the routine latoratory test were 
      completed with measurements of osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OP) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) by using commercially available ELISA kits. 35 heathcare 
      workers served as controls. RESULTS: In patients on regular HD PWV markedly 
      increased and there was several-fold elevation in the interrelated bone-specific 
      proteins (OC, OP, OPG). PWV was found to be independently associated only with OC 
      (β:-0.25, p<0.029) and age (r=0.411,p<0.000), but risk factors for arterial 
      calcification had significant impact on OC (systolic blood pressure, hsCRP, BMI), 
      OPG (age, BMI) and OP (LDL-cholesterol). CONCLUSION: Except for OC, our results 
      failed to document direct association of vascular lesion with OP and OPG, therefore 
      their high circulating levels may be an epiphenomenon or they may have 
      counter-regulatory role to attenuate the uremic calcification process.

TI  - Vitamin D affects survival independently of vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1128-35
LID - 10.2215/CJN.00260109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on 
      vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels 
      between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the 
      relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, 
      and the mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred 
      forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 
      [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels 
      of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) 
      had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean 
      follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments 
      (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, 
      hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and 
      insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected 
      mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D 
      may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be 
      further explored.

TI  - Aortic bypass surgery for asymptomatic patients awaiting a kidney transplant: A word 
      of caution.
PG  - e13218
LID - 10.1111/ctr.13218 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the presence of severe aorto-iliac calcification, aortic bypass 
      surgery can be mandatory to allow kidney transplantation. The aim of our study was 
      to evaluate the safety and outcomes of this strategy among asymptomatic patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients that 
      had undergone vascular bypass surgery prior to kidney transplantation between 
      November 2004 and March 2016. All patients undergoing aortic bypass surgery prior to 
      kidney transplantation without any vascular-related symptoms were included. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one asymptomatic patients were included. Ten patients (48%) have not received 
      a kidney transplant. Four patients died before kidney transplantation, including 2 
      deaths related to the bypass surgery (9.5%). Early post-operative morbidity involved 
      11 cases. Eleven patients (52%) were transplanted. Transplanted patients were 
      significantly younger (median age 60 [56-61] vs 67 [60-72] years, P = .04) at the 
      time of bypass and were less frequently treated for coronary heart disease (9% vs 
      50%, P = .06). CONCLUSION: Aortic bypass surgery performed prior to kidney 
      transplantation among asymptomatic patients has significant mortality and morbidity 
      rates. When transplantation is possible, the results are satisfying. Larger studies 
      are required to define the selection criteria, such as age and coronary heart 
      disease.

TI  - Role of peribrachial fat as a key determinant of brachial artery dilatation for 
      successful arteriovenous fistula maturation in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 3841
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-60734-8 [doi]
LID - 3841
AB  - The functional quality of the inflow artery is one of the most important 
      determinants of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) success. We evaluated the association of 
      early optimal brachial arterial dilatation with a successful AVF maturation and 
      assessed the role of peribrachial adipose tissue in determining brachial arterial 
      distensibility. All patients underwent a preoperative vascular mapping with Doppler 
      ultrasound (US), and only patients who had suitable vessels for AVF creation were 
      enrolled (n = 162). Peribrachial fat thickness was measured using US. To evaluate 
      the degree of brachial dilatation, follow-up US was performed at 1 month after 
      surgery, and early brachial artery dilation was defined as the change in 
      postoperative arterial diameter compared to the preoperative value. The primary 
      outcome was failure to achieve a clinically functional AVF within 8 weeks. 
      Nonfunctional AVF occurred in 21 (13.0%) patients, and they had a significantly 
      lower brachial dilatation than patients with successful AVF during early period 
      after surgery (0.85 vs. 0.43 mm, p = 0.003). Patients with a brachial dilatation 
      greater than median level showed a 1.8-times higher rate of achieving a successful 
      AVF than those without. Interestingly, the early brachial dilatation showed 
      significant correlations with diabetes (r = -0.260, p = 0.001), peribrachial fat 
      thickness (r = -0.301, p = 0.008), and the presence of brachial artery calcification 
      (r = -0.178, p = 0.036). Even after adjustments for demographic factors, 
      comorbidities, and baseline brachial flow volume, peribrachial fat thickness was an 
      independent determinant for early brachial dilatation (β = -0.286, p = 0.013). A 
      close interplay between the peri-brachial fat and brachial dilatation can be 
      translated into novel clinical tools to predict successful AVF maturation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To co-register conventional computed tomography angiography (CTA), with 
      ex vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT) and histology of popliteal 
      atherosclerotic plaques. Improving the non-invasive imaging capabilities may be 
      valuable to advance patient care with peripheral arterial obstructive disease 
      towards lesion and individual based treatment. METHODS: In this prospective 
      observational study, 12 popliteal arteries from 11 symptomatic patients who had 
      undergone transfemoral amputations for chronic limb threatening ischaemia and who 
      had pre-operative CTA, were analysed ex vivo by microCT and histology. A total of 
      353 histological cross sections were co-registered with microCT and CTA, and 
      classified as: lipid rich (LP, n = 26), fibrous (FP, n = 80), or calcific (CP, 
      n = 247) plaques. CTA and microCT plaque density was calculated in 791 regions of 
      interest as Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: CTA and microCT could identify plaque 
      components that were confirmed by histology such as fibrous tissue (FP), lipid 
      pool/core (LP), and calcification (CP). MicroCT densities were 77.8 HU for FP (IQR 
      52.8, 129.5 HU), -28.4 HU for LP (IQR -87.1, 13.2 HU), and 3826.0 HU for CP (IQR 
      2989.0, 4501.0 HU). CTA densities of the three components of the plaque were: 78.0 
      HU for FP (IQR 59.5, 119.8 HU), 32.5 HU for LP (IQR 15.0, 42 HU), and 641.5 HU for 
      CP (IQR 425.8, 1135 HU). The differences were statistically significant between the 
      HU densitometric characteristics among the three groups (p < .0001) for both imaging 
      modalities. Overall, microCT performed better diagnostically than conventional CTA 
      for the three types of plaques: areas under the receiving operator characteristics 
      curve were greater for microCT than CTA for FP (0.97 vs. 0.90), for LP (0.88 vs. 
      0.67), and for CP (0.97 vs. 0.90). CONCLUSION: CTA and microCT can be used to 
      identify histological atherosclerotic plaque components, with better diagnostic 
      performance for microCT. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using microCT to 
      assess plaque morphology lesions in a manner that approaches histology thus becoming 
      a useful tool for ex vivo assessment of atherosclerosis and towards lesion based 
      treatment.

TI  - Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery in haemodialysis 
      patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - AIM: to look for differences in clinical characteristics, and differences in the 
      role of mineral metabolism disorders and inflammation in diabetic and non diabetic 
      patients. METHODS: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 46 with 
      DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery 
      were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest and lower extremities. Clinical 
      characteristics and laboratory values were taken from the medical records. RESULTS: 
      the overall prevalence of vascular calcification was similar in our haemodialysis 
      patients, with or without DM (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general 
      of older age (58.5+10.3 vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 
      vs 86+14 mmHg, p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery 
      calcification (13% vs 2.5%, p<0.05). Vascular calcification in diabetic 
      haemodialysis patients occurred at the same rate in spite of a lower serum P, 
      (5.7+1.5 vs 6.9+1.5 mg/dl, p<0.05), and Ca X P product (52.3+14.5 vs 60.7+14.5, 
      p<0.05), and shorter HD vintage (1.3+0.9 vs 3.2+3.3 years, p<0.05). In a sub 
      analysis comparing patients according to presence and location of vascular 
      calcification, patients with vascular calcification of the peripheral artery only 
      were mostly diabetics (75%), had lower serum Ca (8.6+0.5mg/dl), P (6.7+0.6mg/dl), Ca 
      x P product (57.4+5.10 mg2/dl2), and higher serum CRP (1.70+1.59mg/dl). CONCLUSION: 
      diabetic patients on HD may be at higher risk for peripheral artery calcification, 
      at lower serum Ca, P, and Ca X P product. The higher CRP may indicate a higher 
      inflammatory status, which is probably the major risk factor for vascular 
      calcification of the peripheral artery.

TI  - Association between chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification: the 
      Dallas Heart Study.
PG  - 507-13
AB  - The hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) was tested using data from the Dallas Heart 
      Study, a representative sample of Dallas County residents aged 30 to 65 yr. CKD was 
      defined as presence of microalbuminuria and GFR > or =60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 
      1 to 2), or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 3 to 5), excluding end-stage kidney 
      disease. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between stages of 
      CKD and CAC scores >10, >100, and >400 versus scores < or =10 compared with no CKD 
      while adjusting for covariates. Analyses were repeated after stratifying by presence 
      of diabetes. The mean age was 43.9 yr, and hypertension and diabetes were noted in 
      31.0 and 9.8%, respectively. No association was noted between stage 1 to 2 CKD and 
      increased CAC scores. Compared with no CKD, stage 3 to 5 CKD was associated with CAC 
      scores >100 (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 8.80) and >400 (odds 
      ratio, 8.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.94 to 35.95) in the total population after 
      adjustment for covariates, but these associations were substantially reduced after 
      exclusion of participants with diabetes. Participants with diabetes and stage 3 to 5 
      CKD had a ninefold increased odds of CAC scores >10 versus scores < or =10 compared 
      with participants with diabetes and without CKD, whereas no association was noted 
      between stage 3 to 5 CKD and CAC scores >10 in the nondiabetic population. In 
      conclusion, stage 3 to 5 CKD is associated with increased CAC scores, but this 
      association may be substantially stronger among adults with diabetes. These findings 
      need to be confirmed in study populations that include adults >65 yr of age and a 
      larger number of CKD cases.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification scores improve contrast-induced nephropathy risk 
      assessment in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1298-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of CAC scores for the 
      incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac catheterization in 
      non-dialyzed CKD patients. METHODS: The present study evaluated a total of 140 CKD 
      patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients were stratified into two 
      groups based on the optimal cut-off value of the CAC score, which was graded by a 
      non-triggered, routine diagnostic chest computed tomography scan: CAC score ≥8 (high 
      CAC group); and CAC score <8 (low CAC group). CIN was defined as an increase 
      of >10 % in the baseline serum cystatin C level at 24 h after contrast 
      administration. RESULTS: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate levels were 
      41.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the mean contrast dose administered was 37.5 mL. Patients 
      with high CAC scores exhibited a higher incidence of CIN than patients with low CAC 
      scores (25.5 vs. 3.2 %, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment for confounders, 
      the CAC score predicted CIN (odds ratio 1.68, 95 % confidence interval 1.28-2.21, 
      p < 0.001). Moreover, the C-index for CIN prediction significantly increased when 
      the CAC scores were added to the Mehran risk score (0.855 vs. 0.760, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: CAC scores, as evaluated using semi-quantitative methods, are a simple 
      and powerful predictor of CIN. Incorporating the CAC score in the Mehran risk score 
      significantly improved the predictive ability to predict CIN incidence.

TI  - Normal body mass index with central obesity has increased risk of coronary artery 
      calcification in Korean patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), overweight and mild obesity have shown the lowest 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, central obesity has been directly associated with 
      CV risk in these patients. This bidirectional relationship of body mass index (BMI) 
      and central obesity prompted us to evaluate CV risk based on a combination of BMI 
      and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in nondialysis CKD patients. We included 1078 patients 
      with CKD stage 2 through 5 (nondialysis) enrolled in a nationwide prospective cohort 
      of Korea. Patients were divided into 3 groups by BMI (normal BMI, 18.5-22.9; 
      overweight, 23.0-27.4; and obese, 27.5 and over kg/m(2)) and were dichotomized by a 
      sex-specific median WHR (0.92 in males and 0.88 in females). Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) was determined by multislice computed tomography. CAC (score 
      above 10 Agatston units) was found in 477 patients. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that BMI was not independently associated with CAC. However, WHR 
      showed an independent linear and significant association with CAC (odds ratio, 
      1.036; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.065 per 0.01 increase). Furthermore, when 
      patients were categorized into 6 groups according to a combination of BMI and WHR, 
      normal BMI but higher WHR had the highest risk of CAC compared with the normal BMI 
      with lower WHR group (2.104; 1.074-4.121). Thus, a normal BMI with central obesity 
      was associated with the highest risk of CAC, suggesting that considering BMI and 
      WHR, 2 surrogates of obesity, can help to discriminate CV risk in Korean nondialysis 
      CKD patients.

TI  - Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with changes in bone mineral markers 
      in advanced CKD.
PG  - 281

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are 
      limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, 
      including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl). METHODS: In this prospective, 
      single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 
      and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at 
      baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated 
      using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline. RESULTS: Forty patients with CKD [mean 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m(2)] and 42 
      controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m(2)) completed follow-up. There were no 
      differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant 
      increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was 
      observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects 
      had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic 
      PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, 
      aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) 
      in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic 
      elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, 
      abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness and 
      serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, 
      increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant 
      association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. 
      Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the 
      temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and 
      vascular disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains excessive in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. The association of vascular changes with regulators of 
      extraosseous calcification in this patient population is still under investigation. 
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of the 
      calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG) with vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic hemodialysis patients, we measured 
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) with applanation tonometry, 
      reflecting arterial stiffness, and common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a 
      surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as serum levels of fetuin-A and OPG. 
      Co-morbidities, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory markers and 
      mineral-bone disease serology parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: cfPWV 
      correlated inversely with fetuin-A (r=-0.355, p=0.001) and positively with OPG 
      (r=0.584, p<0.001). In multilinear regression analysis including age, gender, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pulse pressure, LDL, logCRP, both 
      fetuin-A and OPG were independently associated with cfPWV (p=0.024 and p=0.041 
      respectively). ccIMT was negatively associated with fetuin-A (r=-0.312, p=0.005) and 
      positively with OPG (r=0.521, p<0.0001); however these associations lost statistical 
      significance after adjustment for age. CONCLUSION: In chronic hemodialysis patients 
      both fetuin-A and OPG levels are independently associated with arterial stiffness 
      but not with early atherosclerotic vascular changes.

AB  - This is a longitudinal study on 53,560 hemodialysis patients from the Japan Renal 
      Data Registry. Predictor was D[Ca] ≥3.0 vs 2.5 mEq/L. Outcomes were the first CV 
      events during 1-year observation period. Association of D[Ca] with CV events and 
      effect modifications were tested using multivariate logistic regression analyses. 
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) was a significant effect modifier for association of higher 
      D[Ca] and myocardial infarction (MI) (OR: 1.26 (1.03-1.55) among DM and 0.86 
      (0.72-1.03) among non-DM, p for interaction <0.01). The effect size was not affected 
      by further adjustment for serum albumin-corrected Ca or intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH) levels, but was attenuated by adjustment for intradialytic change in serum Ca 
      concentration (ΔCa) (1.16 [0.89-1.51]). Among DM, D[Ca] ≥3.0 mEq/L was significantly 
      associated with MI in the first tertile of corrected Ca or iPTH ≤60 pg/ml (p for 
      interaction 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). In conclusion, higher D[Ca] was associated 
      with incident MI in DM, especially with low serum Ca or iPTH levels. Attenuation of 
      the effect size by adjustment for ΔCa and stratified analyses suggest that larger Ca 
      influx during dialysis with higher D[Ca] in patients suggestive of low bone turnover 
      leads to vascular calcification and subsequent MI in DM.

TI  - Sclerostin as a new key factor in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease 
      stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 2043-2050
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of the Wnt pathway and has 
      been shown to play a key role in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD). The present study aimed to validate its potential as a predictor of 
      vascular calcification in patients with CKD stages 3-4. METHODS: A total of 97 
      patients with CKD stages 3-4 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Routine 
      clinical biochemistry tests and assays for sclerostin and mineral metabolism markers 
      were performed. Additionally, vascular calcification was assessed by multislice 
      spiral computed tomography. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the 
      relationships between sclerostin and vascular calcification. RESULTS: Serum 
      sclerostin levels (30.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.7 ± 12.6 pmol/L, P < 0.05) were significantly 
      elevated in patients with CKD stage 3a compared to in controls and increased with 
      the decline in glomerular filtration rates. Furthermore, patients with vascular 
      calcification had higher serum sclerostin levels. Patients with sclerostin levels 
      above the median value had increased the prevalence of vascular calcification. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed that sclerostin levels were positively associated 
      with vascular calcification. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that sclerostin levels 
      are elevated in patients with CKD and are associated with vascular calcification. 
      Therefore, sclerostin may be used as a predictor of vascular calcification in the 
      clinical setting.

TI  - The Association of Coronary Artery Calcium With Noncardiovascular Disease: The 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 568-576
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if coronary artery calcium (CAC) is 
      associated with incident noncardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: CAC is considered a 
      measure of vascular aging, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. The relationship with noncardiovascular disease is not well 
      defined. METHODS: A total of 6,814 participants from 6 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis) field centers were followed for a median of 10.2 years. Modified 
      Cox proportional hazards ratios accounting for the competing risk of fatal coronary 
      heart disease were calculated for new diagnoses of cancer, pneumonia, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein 
      thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, and dementia. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age; sex; race; socioeconomic status; health insurance status; body mass index; 
      physical activity; diet; tobacco use; number of medications used; systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure; total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 
      antihypertensive, aspirin, and cholesterol medication; and diabetes. The outcome was 
      first incident noncardiovascular disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with those 
      with CAC = 0, those with CAC >400 had an increased hazard of cancer (hazard ratio 
      [HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 1.99), CKD (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.21 
      to 2.39), pneumonia (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.82), COPD (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.60 
      to 4.57), and hip fracture (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 1.47 to 12.50). CAC >400 was not 
      associated with dementia or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Those with 
      CAC = 0 had decreased risk of cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), CKD (HR: 
      0.77; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), COPD (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), and hip fracture 
      (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.70) compared to those with CAC >0. CAC = 0 was 
      not associated with less pneumonia, dementia, or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary 
      embolism. The results were attenuated, but remained significant, after removing 
      participants developing interim nonfatal coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants with elevated CAC were at increased risk of cancer, CKD, COPD, and hip 
      fractures. Those with CAC = 0 are less likely to develop common age-related comorbid 
      conditions, and represent a unique population of "healthy agers."

TI  - Intima media thickness in children undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 1557-64
LID - 10.1007/s00467-012-2173-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uremic vasculopathy, including vascular calcification, increases the 
      risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. We have investigated the prevalence and factors associated with 
      vasculopathy in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in 
      a single center. METHODS: Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and its 
      relation with demographics, biochemical parameters and medication was analyzed in 60 
      patients (mean age 12.9 ± 3.4 years; 27 girls) treated with PD (n = 31) or HD (n = 
      29) for 34 ± 34 months. Patients were divided into two groups: normal cIMT and 
      increased cIMT. RESULTS: Mean levels of calcium, phosphate and calcium/phosphate 
      product were in the normal range, the but parathyroid hormone level, 729 ± 670 
      pg/mL, was higher than the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality 
      Iniative (K/DOQI) recommendations. Twenty-nine patients had increased cIMT, which 
      was associated with time on dialysis of >2 years, hypercalcemia, higher daily dose 
      of calcitriol and HD (vs. PD). In the multivariate analysis, accounting for time on 
      dialysis, HD persisted as a risk for increased cIMT. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 
      increased cIMT in children on dialysis is similar to that reported in adults with 
      CKD and increased with time on dialysis. HD was associated with increased cIMT, 
      independently of time on dialysis; however, the results should be interpreted with 
      caution due to the possible impact of confounding factors. These results underline 
      the need to monitor and, if possible, prevent and treat increased cIMT in children 
      on dialysis.

PG  - 437-43
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently fail to mature 
      because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The pathogenesis of AVF 
      nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing vascular pathologic states: medial 
      fibrosis or microcalcification may limit arterial dilation, and intimal hyperplasia 
      may cause stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50) undergoing AVF placement. PREDICTORS: 
      Medial fibrosis, microcalcification, and intimal hyperplasia in arteries and veins 
      obtained during AVF creation. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: AVF nonmaturation. RESULTS: 
      AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38% of patients despite attempted salvage procedures. 
      Preoperative arterial diameter was associated with upper-arm AVF maturation (P = 
      0.007). Medial fibrosis was similar in patients with nonmaturing and mature AVFs 
      (60% ± 14% vs 66% ± 13%; P = 0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not associated with patient 
      age or diabetes, although both variables were associated significantly with severe 
      medial fibrosis. Conversely, AVF nonmaturation was higher in women than men despite 
      similar medial fibrosis in both sexes. Arterial microcalcification (assessed 
      semiquantitatively) tended to be associated with AVF nonmaturation (1.3 ± 0.8 vs 0.9 
      ± 0.8; P = 0.08). None of the arteries or veins obtained at AVF creation had intimal 
      hyperplasia. However, repeated venous samples obtained in 6 patients during surgical 
      revision of an immature AVF showed venous neointimal hyperplasia. LIMITATIONS: 
      Single-center study. CONCLUSION: Medial fibrosis and microcalcification are frequent 
      in arteries used to create AVFs, but do not explain AVF nonmaturation. Unlike 
      previous studies, intimal hyperplasia was not present at baseline, but developed de 
      novo in nonmaturing AVFs.

TI  - Long-Term Angiotensin II Receptor Blockade Limits Hypertension, Aortic Dysfunction, 
      and Structural Remodeling in a Rat Model of Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 216-229
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with large artery 
      remodeling, endothelial dysfunction and calcification, with angiotensin II (Ang II) 
      a known driver of these pathologies. We investigated long-term Ang II type 1 
      receptor inhibition with valsartan on aortic function and structure in the Lewis 
      polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of CKD. METHODS: Mixed sex LPK and Lewis control 
      (total n = 28) treated (valsartan 60 mg/kg/day p.o. from 4 to 18 weeks) and vehicle 
      groups were studied. Functional responses to noradrenaline (NA), potassium chloride 
      and endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations were investigated in vitro 
      using acetylcholine hydrochloride (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 
      respectively. Effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) substrate L-arginine, NOS 
      inhibitor L-NAME and cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on ACh responses were 
      examined. RESULTS: In the LPK, valsartan reduced systolic blood pressure and urinary 
      protein, ameliorated exaggerated sensitivity to NA, and normalized 
      endothelium-dependent (ACh-Rmax; 91 ± 7 vs. 59 ± 6%, p = 0.0001) and independent 
      dysfunction (SNP-Rmax; 99 ± 1 vs. 82 ± 7%, p = 0.040), as well as improving 
      NO-dependent relaxation (Rmax; -51 ± 6 vs. -26 ± 9%, p = 0.008). Valsartan also 
      reduced aortic wall hypertrophy, elastin disruption/fragmentation, calcification, 
      media cystic degeneration, and levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study highlights the role of Ang II in driving vascular manifestations of CKD 
      and indicates that early treatment can significantly limit pathological changes.

TI  - Aortic stiffness and valvular calcifications in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and extent of cardiac calcifications and aortic 
      stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 
      study group consisted of 60 patients with ESRD with a mean age of 51.7 years, 
      treated with peritoneal dialysis. In all patients transthoracic echocardiogram was 
      performed to assess the following parameters: left ventricular end-systolic 
      diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), interventricular septum 
      end-diastolic diameter (IVSDd), posterior wall end-diastolic diameter (PWDd), 
      ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), aortic maximal and minimal 
      diameter, aortic valve area, mitral valve area (MVA), left ventricular ejection time 
      (LVET), maximal aortic velocity. Aortic stiffness index (AS) was calculated. Aortic 
      and mitral valve calcifications were assessed. RESULTS: Patients with ESRD had a 
      larger left ventricle (LVEDd 5.4 cm vs. 4.76 cm) and its wall was thicker (IVSDd 
      1.36 cm vs. 1.02 cm; PWDd 1.31 cm vs. 0.94 cm). Patients had poorer left ventricle 
      contractility (EF 56.1 vs. 61.6%; FS 28.5 vs. 33.2%). Atherosclerotic plaques, 
      calcified plaques and valvular calcifications were more frequently detected in 
      patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD had significantly higher values of the AS 
      index: (5.34 vs. 3.24). Among ESRD subjects with the stiffer aorta, atherosclerotic 
      plaques including calcificones and the aortic valve damage were more frequently 
      detected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESRD are characterized by increased aortic 
      stiffness. Atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta as well as cardiac and large vessels 
      calcifications are more common among patients with ESRD. In patients with ESRD there 
      is a correlation between an increase in aortic stiffness and damage of aortic 
      valvular leaflets as well as calcifications of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta. 
      The degree of aortic stiffness is not related to impairment of mitral valvular 
      leaflets and extravalvular calcifications. A relationship between aortic stiffness 
      and aortic or aortic valve calcifications suggest a different pathogenesis of aorta 
      calcification as compared to that underlying calcifications of other localizations.

TI  - Predictors of atherosclerotic events in patients on haemodialysis: post hoc analyses 
      from the AURORA study.
PG  - 102-112
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on haemodialysis (HD) are at high risk for cardiovascular 
      events, but heart failure and sudden death are more common than atherosclerotic 
      events. The A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatinin in Subjects on Regular 
      Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) trial was 
      designed to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction and death 
      from any cardiac cause in 2773 HD patients. We studied predictors of the 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in AURORA. METHODS: We readjudicated all 
      deaths and presumed myocardial infarctions according to the criteria used in the 
      Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP); these were specifically developed to 
      separate atherosclerotic from non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. The 
      readjudicated atherosclerotic end point included the first event of the following: 
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal and fatal 
      non-haemorrhagic stroke, coronary revascularization procedures and death from 
      ischaemic limb disease. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to identify the 
      predictors of such events. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 506 
      patients experienced the new composite atherosclerotic outcome. Age, male sex, 
      prevalent diabetes, prior cardiovascular disease, weekly dialysis duration, baseline 
      albumin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99 per g/L 
      increase], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04-1.22 per mg/L 
      increase) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HR 1.09; 95% CI 
      1.03-1.17 per 10 U/L increase) were selected as significant predictors in the model. 
      Neither LDL cholesterol nor allocation to placebo/rosuvastatin therapy predicted the 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the use of strict criteria for end point definition, 
      non-traditional risk factors, but not lipid disturbances, predicted atherosclerotic 
      events in HD patients.

TI  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary hypertension in older 
      patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria.
PG  - 353-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-014-0889-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary vascular calcification and 
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a chronic kidney failure dog model, and increased 
      prevalence of PH and a PH-hyperparathyroidism relationship in pre-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis patients are reported. This study investigated 
      the prevalence of PH and relationships between PH and metabolic abnormalities in 
      patients with stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD. METHODS: One-hundred and ninety patients 
      (mean age 61 ± 17.4, 116 males) with proteinuria CKD and no coronary diseases, 
      congestive heart failure, smoking history, and pulmonary diseases were enrolled. 
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate was 39.7 ± 23 ml/min. CKD etiology was diabetes 
      mellitus in 52 (27.3 %), chronic glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis 
      in 56 (29.4 %), hypertension in 36 (19 %), and other etiologies (nephrolithiasis, 
      obstructive nephropathy, and amyloidosis) in 46 (25.3 %) patients. Echocardiography 
      was performed, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left ventricular 
      ejection fraction were determined. Laboratory tests examined lipid parameters, serum 
      albumin, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein, parathyroid 
      hormone, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels. RESULTS: PH (PAP >35 mmHg) was detected in 
      68 patients (35.9 %). Patients with PH were older (68 ± 12.3 vs. 52.1 ± 16.7, p = 
      0.03), had lower ejection fractions (51.3 ± 13.4 vs. 60.8 ± 9.1 %, p = 0.003), lower 
      hemoglobin (11.3 ± 1.5 vs. 12.1 ± 1.9, p = 0.05), and higher parathyroid hormone 
      (218 ± 159.3 vs. 127.7 ± 67.4 pg/ml, p = 0.05) levels. The remaining parameters were 
      similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, lower ejection fraction, and 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to PH in stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD.

TI  - High Serum Sclerostin Levels Are Associated with a Better Outcome in Haemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1159/000443845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis. 
      Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification 
      (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin 
      levels are high. AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, 
      bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum 
      sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and 
      survival rate. RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin 
      level of 1.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum 
      sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were 
      significantly older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male 
      gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 
      ± 9 vs. 20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed 
      lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD 
      scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate 
      compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% 
      CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher 
      BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not associated with increased ambulatory central aortic 
      systolic pressure in prevalent dialysis patients.
PG  - 4-8
LID - 10.5830/CVJA-2013-081 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts 
      cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent 
      dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also determined 
      whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with changes in 
      CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement. METHODS: All 
      patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score, lateral abdominal 
      radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left ventricular mass 
      index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro calibrated to brachial 
      blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard BPro SOFT(®) data into 
      ambulatory CASP. RESULTS: Ambulatory CASP was not different in those without and 
      with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 
      mmHg, respectively, p = 0.2) calcification. Furthermore, when expressed as a 
      percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure to control for peripheral blood 
      pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished: CASP: brachial systolic blood 
      pressure ratio = 0.9 across all categories regardless of the presence of coronary or 
      aortic calcification (p = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Supporting this finding, left 
      ventricular mass index was also not different in those with or without vascular 
      calcification (p = 0.7 and 0.8 for coronary and aortic calcification). 
      Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP correlated excellently with ambulatory 
      measurements (r = 0.9 for both). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcification was not 
      associated with changes in ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure in this 
      cohort of prevalent dialysis patients. Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP 
      correlated very well with ambulatory measurement.

      mass index in dialysis patients.
PG  - 635-9
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2015.1010416 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral cholecalciferol 
      treatment on vascular calcification, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and other 
      cardiac functions in dialysis patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: A six-month course of 
      oral cholecalciferol treatment was recommended to dialysis patients with vitamin D 
      insufficiency. While 26 patients were given cholecalciferol treatment, 17 patients 
      who could not tolerate to therapy received standard therapy. Initial biochemical 
      parameters were measured, and they were measured again after 6 months of treatment. 
      Echocardiographic measurements were also performed, and the vascular calcification 
      score (VCS) was calculated at baseline and at the 6th month. RESULTS: The 
      cholecalciferol replacement group showed no significant change in LVMI and VCS 
      values (p > 0.05). However, while LVMI was similar between groups at initial 
      evaluation, it was lower in the cholecalciferol group at the 6th month when compared 
      to the standard treatment group (141.8 ± 40.2 g/m(2) vs. 166.3 ± 31.4 g/m(2); 
      p = 0.04). Likewise, left ventricular diastolic diameters (48.8 ± 5.1 mm vs. 
      47.5 ± 4.6 mm; p = 0.023) and left atrial diameters (41.2 ± 8.9 mm vs. 
      38.9 ± 8.1 mm; p = 0.006) decreased in the cholecalciferol group. Additionally, 
      significant increases were observed in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 
      albumin levels, with a significant decrease in serum C-reactive protein levels. 
      CONCLUSION: A lesser increase in left ventricular mass and better diastolic 
      functions was observed in dialysis patients after 6 months of cholecalciferol 
      treatment.

TI  - Association studies of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) polymorphisms with serum 
      concentrations of glucose and phosphate, and vascular calcification in renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - e0119459
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119459 [doi]
LID - e0119459
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in renal transplant 
      recipients (RTRs) and linked to arterial calcification. The calcium-sensing receptor 
      (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a pivotal role in extracellular calcium 
      homeostasis and is expressed in the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall. 
      We investigated whether common CASR gene variants are predictors for aortic and 
      coronary artery calcification or influence risk factors such as serum calcium, 
      phosphate and glucose concentrations in RTRs. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty four 
      RTRs were investigated for associations between three CASR promoter region single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs115759455, rs7652589, rs1501899), three 
      non-synonymous CASR coding region SNPs (A986S, R990G, Q1011E), and aortic and 
      coronary artery calcium mass scores, cardiovascular outcomes and calcification risk 
      factors that included serum phosphate, calcium, total cholesterol and glucose 
      concentrations. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that RTRs homozygous for the 
      minor allele (SS) of the A986S SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major 
      allele (AA), had raised serum glucose concentrations (8.7±5.4 vs. 5.7±2.1 mmol/L, 
      P<0.05). In addition, RTRs who were heterozygous (CT) at the rs115759455 SNP, when 
      compared to those homozygous for the major allele (CC), had higher serum phosphate 
      concentrations (1.1±0.3 vs. 1.0±0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05). CASR SNPs were not significant 
      determinants for aortic or coronary artery calcification, and were not associated 
      with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this RTR cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Common 
      CASR SNPs may be independent predictors of serum glucose and phosphate 
      concentrations, but are not determinants of vascular calcification or cardiovascular 
      outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The correction of metabolic acidosis caused by renal failure is 
      achieved by adding bicarbonate during dialysis. In order to avoid the precipitation 
      of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate that takes place in the dialysis fluid 
      (DF) when adding bicarbonate, it is necessary to add an acid, usually acetate, which 
      is not free of side effects. Thus, citrate appears as an advantageous alternative to 
      acetate, despite the fact that its acute effects are not accurately known. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the acute effect of a dialysis fluid containing citrate instead 
      of acetate on acid-base balance and calcium-phosphorus metabolism parameters. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective crossover study was conducted with twenty-four 
      patients (15 male subjects and 9 female subjects). All patients underwent dialysis 
      with AK-200-Ultra-S monitor with SoftPac® dialysis fluid, made with 3 mmol/L of 
      acetate and SelectBag Citrate®, with 1 mmol/L of citrate and free of acetate. The 
      following were measured before and after dialysis: venous blood gas monitoring, 
      calcium (Ca), ionic calcium (Cai), phosphorus (P) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). 
      RESULTS: Differences (p<0.05) were found when using the citrate bath (C) compared to 
      acetate (A) in the postdialysis values of: pH, C: 7.43 (0.04) vs. A: 7.47 (0.05); 
      bicarbonate, C: 24.7 (2.7) vs. A: 27.3 (2.1) mmol/L; base excess (BEecf), C: 0.4 
      (3.1) vs. A: 3.7 (2.4) mmol/L; corrected calcium (Cac), C: 9.8 (0.8) vs. A: 10.1 
      (0.7) mg/dL; and Cai, C: 1.16 (0.05) vs. A: 1.27 (0.06) mmol/L. No differences were 
      found in either of the parameters measured before dialysis. CONCLUSION: Dialysis 
      with citrate provides better control of postdialysis acid-base balance, 
      decreases/avoids postdialysis alkalaemia, and lowers the increase in Cac and Cai. 
      This finding is of special interest in patients with predisposing factors for 
      arrhythmia and patients with respiratory failure, carbon dioxide retention, 
      calcifications and advanced liver disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen on 
      mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary CT as it may 
      serve as a potential marker for increased risk of developing symptomatic coronary 
      artery disease (CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the imaging 
      database at our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent coronary CT 
      within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary calcium score on 
      CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification by weighted value assigned to 
      its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for all lesions and expressed as Agaston 
      score. Calculated scores were risk stratified for developing CAD as follows: 0-no 
      risk; 1-10-minimal; 11-100-mild; 101-400-moderate; >400-high risk. Percentile 
      distribution of calcium score adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based 
      on results of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which excluded 
      patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms were reviewed by 
      MQSA-certified breast radiologists who were blinded to patients' coronary calcium 
      scores. Mammograms were interpreted for presence or absence of BAC. The calcium 
      scores and corresponding percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography. 
      Cardiac risk factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history 
      of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: BAC correlated with 
      coronary calcium score of >11 (p=0.0001), corresponding to mild or greater risk of 
      developing CAD. Specifically, coronary calcium score of >11 was seen in 68% (25/37) 
      of patients with BAC and 31% (34/108) of patients without BAC. Accounting for race, 
      gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically significant correlation with 
      percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4% (19/27) of patients with BAC vs. 44.6% 
      (41/92) of patient without BAC showed percentile score of >25 for developing CAD. 
      Statistically significant association was observed of BAC with diabetes (p=0.01) and 
      chronic renal disease (p=0.005). BAC showed no significant associated with 
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD. CONCLUSION: BAC 
      does predict coronary artery calcium score of >11, which indicates mild or greater 
      risk of developing CAD. In addition, statistically significant correlation exists 
      between BAC and cardiac risk factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our 
      study suggests that BAC on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker for 
      increased risk of developing CAD.

TI  - Plaque surface irregularity and calcification length within carotid plaque predict 
      secondary events in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 29-34
LID - S0021-9150(16)31476-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.11.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although comprehensive risk factor modification is recommended, 
      a uniform management strategy does not necessarily prevent secondary events in 
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, identification of high-risk 
      patients who may benefit from more intensive interventions may improve prognosis. 
      Carotid ultrasound can reliably identify systemic atherosclerosis, and carotid 
      plaque and intima-media thickness (IMT) are known independent risk factors for CAD. 
      However, it is unclear whether findings on carotid ultrasound can improve prediction 
      of secondary CAD events. METHODS: The study population comprised 146 consecutive 
      patients with CAD (mean age, 66 ± 9 years; 126 with angina pectoris, 20 with acute 
      myocardial infarction). IMT, plaque score, plaque area, plaque surface irregularity, 
      and calcification length (calculated by summing the calcified lesions within each 
      plaque accompanied by acoustic shadow) were measured at baseline. Patients were 
      followed for 10 years to ascertain secondary CAD events defined as hard major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction) 
      and as total MACE (hard MACE and angina pectoris with coronary revascularization). 
      RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that calcification length 
      (p < 0.05) and plaque surface irregularity (p < 0.01) remained independently 
      associated with total MACE after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, 
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, smoking, and multivessel CAD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the combination of calcification length and 
      plaque surface irregularity has additional value beyond traditional risk 
      classification. Intensive intervention for these high-risk patients may avoid or 
      delay progression of atherosclerosis towards secondary CAD events.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast 
      activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent data indicate 
      that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet 
      receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was 
      assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to 
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin 
      levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
      determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. 
      Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) 
      (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of 
      AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin 
      levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher 
      body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower 
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In 
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history 
      (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
      determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that 
      patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
      multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
      experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
      protects against progression of vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether newer risk markers for coronary heart disease (CHD) improve CHD 
      risk prediction remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether newer risk markers for 
      CHD risk prediction and stratification improve Framingham risk score (FRS) 
      predictions. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: The Rotterdam 
      Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 5933 asymptomatic, 
      community-dwelling participants (mean age, 69.1 years [SD, 8.5]). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Traditional CHD risk factors used in the FRS (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, 
      treatment of hypertension, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, 
      smoking, and diabetes) and newer CHD risk factors (N-terminal fragment of prohormone 
      B-type natriuretic peptide levels, von Willebrand factor antigen levels, fibrinogen 
      levels, chronic kidney disease, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein levels, 
      homocysteine levels, uric acid levels, coronary artery calcium [CAC] scores, carotid 
      intima-media thickness, peripheral arterial disease, and pulse wave velocity). 
      RESULTS: Adding CAC scores to the FRS improved the accuracy of risk predictions 
      (c-statistic increase, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06]; net reclassification index, 
      19.3% overall [39.3% in those at intermediate risk, by FRS]). Levels of N-terminal 
      fragment of prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide also improved risk predictions but 
      to a lesser extent (c-statistic increase, 0.02 [CI, 0.01 to 0.04]; net 
      reclassification index, 7.6% overall [33.0% in those at intermediate risk, by FRS]). 
      Improvements in predictions with other newer markers were marginal. LIMITATION: The 
      findings may not be generalizable to younger or nonwhite populations. CONCLUSION: 
      Among 12 CHD risk markers, improvements in FRS predictions were most statistically 
      and clinically significant with the addition of CAC scores. Further investigation is 
      needed to assess whether risk refinements using CAC scores lead to a meaningful 
      change in clinical outcome. Whether to use CAC score screening as a more routine 
      test for risk prediction requires full consideration of the financial and clinical 
      costs of performing versus not performing the test for both persons and health 
      systems. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Netherlands Organization for Health Research and

TI  - Mineral metabolism disorders, vertebral fractures and aortic calcifications in

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between mineral metabolism disorders, 
      bone fractures and vascular calcifications in kidney transplant recipients has not 
      been established. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study in 727 stable 
      recipients from 28 Spanish transplant clinics. Mineral metabolism parameters, the 
      semi-quantification of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcifications were 
      determined centrally. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3<15ng/ml) was more common 
      in female recipients at CKD-T stages I-III (29.6% vs 44.4%; p=0.003). The inverse 
      and significant correlation between 25OHD3 and PTH was gender-specific and women 
      exhibited a steeper slope than men (p=0.01). Vertebral fractures (VFx) with 
      deformity grade ≥2 were observed in 15% of recipients. Factors related to VFx 
      differed by gender; in males, age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and CsA treatment (OR: 
      3.2; 95% CI: 1.6-6.3); in females, age (OR 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12) and PTH levels 
      (OR per 100pg/ml increase: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.043-1.542). Abdominal aortic 
      calcifications were common (67.2%) and related to classical risk factors but not to 
      mineral metabolism parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is more common 
      among female kidney transplant recipients at earlier CKD-T stages, and it 
      contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Prevalent vertebral fractures are only 
      related to high serum PTH levels in female recipients.

TI  - Association of bone turnover markers and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis chronic

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased 
      vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation of the 
      calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains unclear. We 
      investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors 
      (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone; 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged 
      (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover markers (bone-specific 
      alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and 
      MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), 
      femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was 
      assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a 
      significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, 
      p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were 
      seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) 
      and SI(DVP) independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant 
      relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A 
      significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SI(DVP) in CKD 
      stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following 
      correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data 
      suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in 
      pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical 
      usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD.

TI  - [Calciphylaxis: fatal complication of cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with end 
      stage kidney disease].
PG  - 32-6
AB  - Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to subcutaneous small 
      arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but usually fatal. Disorders of calcium 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in dialysis patients but 
      calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we 
      proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development. METHODS: We 
      studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis in our service from 
      january 2001 to december 2006. RESULTS: All patients were female with mean age at 
      diagnosis 68.5+/-6.7 years. All patients were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 
      patients had been receiving hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had 
      diabetes mellitus type II and all patients were obese (BMI >25 kg/m2). All patients 
      had metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were 
      receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn t have severe 
      alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus <55. All 
      patients developed low blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment 
      (98.3+/-22.7/60+/-18,29 mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions 
      like abdomen and thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in 
      arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, 
      seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, 
      without specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes 
      mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low 
      blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to develop 
      calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In these 
      patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis, dialysis 
      hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia of 
      subcutaneous adipose tissue.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to low 
      bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the latter 
      are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary artery calcium 
      (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). In 66 ESRD 
      patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 
      DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree of VC score (graded 
      by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx; 
      n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the patients, 26% had osteopenia and 
      7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of 
      those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score (>100 Agatston units). CAC scores 
      correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg and pelvic sub-regions were 
      significantly lower in patients with extensive VC. In multivariate regression 
      analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated 
      with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and patients with extensive VC had 
      significantly higher CAC score. Both high CAC and extensive VC were independently 
      predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD has the potential to identify ESRD patients at 
      risk of vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease--mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are 
      associated with vascular calcification and abnormal electrolytes that lead to 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. CKD-MBD is identified by imbalances in serum 
      calcium (Ca), phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although the relation of 
      phosphate and PTH with the prognosis of HF patients has been reported, the 
      association of Ca with prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and CKD remains 
      unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 191 patients admitted for HF and CKD 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)), and they were 
      divided into 2 groups based on levels of corrected Ca: low Ca (Ca <8.4 mg/dL; n = 
      32) and normal-high Ca (8.4 ≤Ca; n = 159). We compared laboratory and 
      echocardiographic findings, as well as followed cardiac and all-cause mortality. The 
      low-Ca group had 1) higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (308.9 vs. 261.0 U/L; P = 
      .026), 2) lower levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (26.1 vs. 45.0 pg/mL; P = .011) 
      and hydrogen carbonate (22.4 vs. 24.5 mmol/L; P = .031), and 3) a tendency to have a 
      higher PTH level (87.5 vs. 58.6 pg/mL; P = .084). In contrast, left and right 
      ventricular systolic function, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein, 
      phosphate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and zinc did not differ between the 2 
      groups. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, cardiac and all-cause mortality were 
      significantly higher in the low-Ca group than in the normal-high-Ca group (P < .05). 
      In the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, hypocalcemia was an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD patients (P < .05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF 
      and CKD patients.

AB  - AIM: To determine the associations between insulin resistance, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF-23), and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. INTRODUCTION: FGF-23 is associated with atherosclerosis and 
      cardiovascular disease, but its association with insulin resistance in CKD has not 
      been explored. SUBJECTS: Cross sectional study of 72 stage 3-5 CKD patients 
      receiving care in Ontario, Canada. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin resistance was 
      measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), FGF-23 
      was measured by carboxyl terminal enzyme linked immunoassay (ctFGF-23) and CAC was 
      measured by multi-slice computed tomography. RESULTS: Median HOMA-IR was 2.19μU/ml 
      (interquartile range 1.19 to 3.94). Patients with HOMA-IR>2.2 had greater ctFGF-23 
      (179.7 vs 109.6; P=0.03), and 40% higher log CAC scores (2.09±0.87 vs 1.58±1.26; 
      P=0.049). Multivariable linear regression adjusted for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, 
      kidney function, and parathyroid hormone revealed insulin resistance was a risk 
      factor for greater log ctFGF-23 levels (log HOMA IR β=0.37; 95% confidence interval 
      0.14 to 0.59; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistant CKD patients demonstrated 
      higher FGF-23 levels, and increased CAC, while PO4 levels remained normal, 
      suggesting a potential link between insulin resistance and PO4 homeostasis in CKD.

TI  - [Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk factors in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients].
PG  - 313-8
AB  - Cardiovascular (CVS) morbidity and mortality in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy is 10-30 folds higher than in general 
      population. The prevalence of well known traditional risk factors such as age, sex, 
      race, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity 
      is higher in the uraemic patients. Besides these, there are specific, nontraditional 
      risk factors for dialysis patients. Mild inflammation present in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients which can be confirmed by specific inflammatory markers is the cause 
      of CVS morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hypoalbuminaemia, 
      hyperhomocysteinaemia and a higher level of leptin are important predictors of 
      vascular complications as well as CVS events in the PD patients. Plasma 
      norepinephrine, an indicator of sympathetic activity, is high in the ESRD patients 
      and higher in the PD patients than in the patients on haemodialysis (HD). Therefore, 
      norepinephrine may be a stronger risk factor in the PD patients. The same applies to 
      asymmetric dimethylargine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, 
      which is an important risk factor of CVS morbidity and mortality 15 % higher in the 
      PD than the HD patients. Hyperphosphataemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and high 
      calcium x phosphate product have been associated with the progression of the 
      coronary artery calcification and valvular calcifications and predict all-cause CVS 
      mortality in the PD patients. Residual renal function (RRF) declines with time on 
      dialysis but is slower in the PD than the HD patients. RRF decline is associated 
      with the rise of proinflammatory cytokines and the onset of hypervolaemia and 
      hypertension which increase the risk of CVS diseases, mortality in general and CVS 
      mortality. In conclusion, it is very important to establish all CVS risk factors in 
      the PD patients to prevent CVS diseases and CVS mortality in this population.

TI  - Association of serum calcitonin with coronary artery disease in individuals with and

PG  - 1169-75
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0076-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral 
      metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as 
      novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, 
      another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in 
      detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and 
      the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, 
      in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 
      87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the associations 
      between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × phosphate 
      product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, the Gensini CAD 
      severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 
      25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for 
      the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin 
      D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), 
      FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini 
      score. In the second step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, 
      proteinuria, and GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained 
      statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of 
      mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater severity 
      of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and nontraditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger populations including 
      patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

TI  - Capillary rarefaction in advanced chronic kidney disease is associated with high 
      phosphorus and bicarbonate levels.
PG  - 3529-36
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), disorders of mineral 
      metabolism are associated with vascular calcifications and mortality. Microvascular 
      dysfunction, by affecting flow resistance and tissue perfusion, may explain the 
      cardiovascular sequelae of CKD-associated disorders of mineral metabolism. We 
      investigated whether advanced CKD is associated with a decrease in the functional 
      and structural number of capillaries in skin and subsequently whether capillary 
      rarefaction is related to mineral metabolism. METHODS: Capillary density was 
      measured by nailfold microscopy in 19 predialysis and 35 CKD Stage 5 (CKD5) patients 
      and 19 controls. In CKD patients, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 
      25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25vitD3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25vitD3) were analysed 
      as well. RESULTS: Capillary density at baseline was 42 ± 15/mm(2) in predialysis 
      patients, 45 ± 17/mm(2) in CKD5 patients and 56 ± 20/mm(2) in controls (patients 
      versus controls, respectively, P < 0.05 and P = 0.05). Absolute capillary 
      recruitment during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia was 17 ± 7/mm(2), 14 ± 6/mm(2) 
      and 23 ± 8/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and controls). Capillary 
      density during venous occlusion was 59 ± 20/mm(2), 59 ± 21/mm(2) and 77 ± 21/mm(2), 
      respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and controls). In multiple regression 
      analysis, both serum phosphorus and bicarbonate values were independently and 
      inversely associated with capillary density at baseline (r(2) of model = 19%) as 
      well as during venous occlusion (r(2) of model = 28%). Furthermore, both serum 
      phosphorus and bicarbonate were inversely and female gender positively correlated 
      with capillary density during recruitment (r(2) of model = 37%). CONCLUSION: 
      Advanced CKD is characterized by an impaired functional and structural capillary 
      density in skin, which is related to both high phosphorus and bicarbonate values.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy reduces intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients with 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 323-31
LID - 10.1159/000350160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with vascular calcification 
      and arterial stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this 
      study was to analyze the frequency of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and 
      cardiovascular function before and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We compared predialytic and intradialytic blood 
      pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), and 
      cardiothoracic ratio 1 month before PTX, and 6 and 12 months after PTX. IDH was 
      defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in mean 
      arterial pressure ≥ 10 mmHg. RESULTS: At the time of PTX, the mean age of the 
      patients was 57.4 ± 12.0 years, and the mean dialysis vintage was 12.2 ± 5.8 years. 
      At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after PTX, the average numbers of sessions 
      disturbed by IDH during 13 dialysis sessions (1 month) were 6.4, 3.9 (p < 0.016 vs. 
      baseline), and 4.0 sessions (p < 0.037 vs. baseline, p = 0.801 vs. 6 months), 
      respectively. LVEF and RVEF were improved significantly after PTX. Furthermore, 
      volume status was also improved, as evidenced by the significantly greater 
      ultrafiltration volume and reduced cardiothoracic ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis 
      patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism are more likely to achieve 
      normotensive and euvolemic status after PTX, probably through improved heart 
      function and reduced IDH episodes.

TI  - Cardiac vascular calcification and QT interval in ESRD patients: is there a link?
PG  - 451-9
AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
      between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
      studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 +/- 
      27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 
      years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good 
      mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 
      4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 
      mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than 
      CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in 
      both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification 
      than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher 
      or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), 
      frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), 
      parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). 
      The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores 
      (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients 
      with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in 
      both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, 
      age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium 
      x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
      of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac 
      calcification in uraemic patients.

LID - 190
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
      remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also 
      a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to 
      test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. METHODS: we measured 
      serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year 
      period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, 
      patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were 
      included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 
      patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower 
      creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl 
      (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk 
      analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and 
      gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve 
      these patients survival needs to be determined.

      risk factors.
PG  - 94-8
LID - 10.1159/000355548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Compared to all other complications, literature data about vascular 
      access aneurysm (VAA) are the scarcest. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to 
      evaluate the prevalence of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysms and to confirm the 
      risk factors for their appearance. METHODS: The presence, number and morphological 
      characteristics of AVF aneurysms were confirmed, and according to the score of AVF 
      aneurysm (the sum of the length and width in cm), patients were classified into 
      group 1 (score ≤12) and group 2 (score >12). Analysis included the last data from 
      the medical records including vascular calcifications score. RESULTS: Out of 181 
      patients, 150 with native fistula were included in this study. Aneurysmatic changes 
      were detected in 90 (60%) patients, and the majority had two or more aneurysms. VAA 
      were more frequent in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) than in 
      other diagnostic categories. By using forward stepwise logistic regression, we 
      confirmed that patients on high-flux hemodialysis (HD) had 5.3-fold higher risk, and 
      patients with diabetes mellitus had 5.8-fold less risk for developing AVF aneurysm. 
      While vascular calcification score did not influence the incidence of VAA, higher 
      PWV had significant negative influence on formation of AVF aneurysm (OR 1.25, 95% CI 
      1.003-1.56, p = 0.047). By ROC curve analysis, it was determined that patients who 
      were longer than 5.7 years on HD had greater risk for developing VAA (area = 0.741, 
      p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: This single-center study confirmed the very high prevalence 
      of VAA (60%). Aneurysms were more frequent in patients with ADPKD and in those who 
      had longer dialysis vintage on high-flux membranes with higher blood flow rate.

TI  - Transgenic Overexpression of Tissue-Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase (TNAP) in 
      Vascular Endothelium Results in Generalized Arterial Calcification.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002499 [doi]
LID - e002499
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectopic vascular calcification is a common condition associated with 
      aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and/or chronic kidney disease. Smooth muscle cells 
      are the best characterized source of osteogenic progenitors in the vasculature; 
      however, recent studies suggest that cells of endothelial origin can also promote 
      calcification. To test this, we sought to increase the osteogenic potential of 
      endothelial cells by overexpressing tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), 
      a key enzyme that regulates biomineralization, and to determine the 
      pathophysiological effect of endothelial TNAP on vascular calcification and 
      cardiovascular function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated previously that mice 
      transgenic for ALPL (gene encoding human TNAP) develop severe arterial medial 
      calcification and reduced viability when TNAP is overexpressed in smooth muscle 
      cells. In this study, we expressed the ALPL transgene in endothelial cells following 
      endothelial-specific Tie2-Cre recombination. Mice with endothelial TNAP 
      overexpression survived well into adulthood and displayed generalized arterial 
      calcification. Genes associated with osteochondrogenesis (Runx2, Bglap, Spp1, Opg, 
      and Col2a1) were upregulated in the aortas of endothelial TNAP animals compared with 
      controls. Lesions in coronary arteries of endothelial TNAP mice showed 
      immunoreactivity to Runx2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and collagen II as well as 
      increased deposition of sialoproteins revealed by lectin staining. By 23 weeks of 
      age, endothelial TNAP mice developed elevated blood pressure and compensatory left 
      ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      presented a novel genetic model demonstrating the osteogenic potential of 
      TNAP-positive endothelial cells in promoting pathophysiological vascular 
      calcification.

TI  - Serum phosphorus is related to left ventricular remodeling independent of renal 
      function in hospitalized patients with chronic kidney disease.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicated that phosphorus emerged as an important 
      cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The fact 
      that serum phosphorus was closely linked to vascular and valvar calcification may 
      account for one important reason. However, left ventricular remodeling may also 
      serve as another potential mechanism of the cardiac toxicity of phosphorus. In the 
      present study, we evaluated the association of serum phosphorus with left 
      ventricular remodeling. METHODS: We investigated consecutive hospitalized patients 
      with pre-dialysis CKD, who did not have symptomatic heart failure or take any 
      phosphorus binder or calcitriol medications. Transthoracic echocardiography was 
      applied to assess their left ventricular remodeling indices, both structural and 
      functional. RESULTS: The 296 study subjects (mean age 56.4years) included 169 
      (57.1%) men, 203 (68.6%) hypertensive patients. In addition to gender, systolic 
      blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum phosphorus was an 
      independent determinant of left ventricular mass index (LVMI, P=0.001). Similarly, 
      serum phosphorus was also a determinant of left ventricular end diastolic dimension 
      (P=0.0003), but not of relative wall thickness. In multivariate logistic analyses, 
      serum phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with the prevalence 
      of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, odds ratio [OR] 2.38 for each 1mmol/L 
      increase, 95% CI 1.20-4.75, P=0.01). Moreover, the association was only confirmatory 
      in eccentric LVH (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.43-6.32, P=0.003) but not in concentric LVH 
      (1.38, 95% CI, 0.54-3.49, P=0.50). CONCLUSION: Serum phosphorus was significantly 
      and independently associated with LVMI and the prevalence of eccentric LVH in 
      hospitalized patients with CKD.

TI  - Fetuin-A and arterial stiffness in patients with normal kidney function.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.12.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between fetuin-A level (AHSG), its encoding gene 
      (Thr256Ser) and arterial function in subjects with normal kidney function. 
      INTRODUCTION: The aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a predictor for 
      cardiovascular mortality. Fetuin-A is a calcification inhibitor and correlates 
      negatively with increased vascular stiffness in dialysis patients. The fetuin-A 
      polymorphism (Thr256Ser) is associated with reduced fetuin levels and accelerated 
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Little is known about the role of 
      fetuin-A as an independent predictor for the development of arterial stiffness in 
      healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 116 subjects with normal kidney 
      function (age 47+/-12 years, 50 females and 66 males) of the FLEMENGHO study. 
      Calcium measurements, plasma fetuin-A, its encoding gene (Thr256Ser) and indexes of 
      arterial stiffness, such as aPWV and arterial distensibility, were determined. 
      RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aPWV (r=-0.21, p=0.029). 
      After an adjustment for multiple covariables, fetuin-A levels were independently 
      associated with aPWV (r=-0.30, p=0.022) in males but not in females. Male fetuin-A 
      SerSer carrier had lower fetuin-A levels and higher aPWV (fetuin-A: 61.9+/-29.0 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 14.3+/-0.9 m/s) as compared to ThrThr (fetuin-A: 109.9+/-54.9 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.4+/-1.3 m/s) and ThrSer carrier (fetuin-A: 100.8+/-52.5 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.6+/-1.3 m/s). Other calcium variables were not significantly 
      associated with arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: With respect to common calcium 
      variables, only fetuin-A level showed an inverse relation with aPWV in men with 
      normal renal function. Male fetuin-A SerSer carriers demonstrate particularly high 
      aortic stiffness, possibly implying a status of increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Subclinical peripheral arterial disease in patients with chronic kidney disease: 
      prevalence and related risk factors.
PG  - S44-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic artery disease is a common condition in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, there are few published data on the 
      prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in nondialyzed patients with renal 
      insufficiency. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, noninvasive, and reliable 
      method to assess PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevalence of PAD using ABI was 
      investigated in 102 patients referred for the first time to a nephrology clinic with 
      CKD in stages 3 to 5 of the K/DOQI classification, and with no previous diagnosis of 
      PAD. Patients with ABI <0.9 were considered positive for PAD. A total of 64% of the 
      patients were male. The mean age was 70 +/- 11 (range 58-84) years, and the 
      estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 35 +/- 12 (range 6-59) mL/min(-1). Of the 
      total sample, 26% were diabetics, 10% active smokers, 48% ex-smokers, and 29% had a 
      diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD), 15% had been previously diagnosed of 
      stroke, and 17% had signs and symptoms compatible with intermittent claudication, 
      which had passed unnoticed. Thirty-two percent of patients had an ABI <0.9 (mean 
      0.64 +/- 0.25). Of these patients with PAD, 84% were men (P < 0.005), and only 30% 
      presented a clinical picture compatible with intermittent claudication. Absolute 
      risk of CHD according to the Framingham 1998 score was higher in the PAD group 
      (19.3% +/- 6 vs. 13.1% +/- 8; P= 0.01). Patients with PAD were older (75 +/- 6 vs. 
      66 +/- 11 years, P= 0.000), and had worse renal function (CrCl 30.8 +/- 12 vs. 37 
      +/- 10.7 mL.min(-1), P= 0.016) compared to patients without PAD, but no differences 
      were found in cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL), calcium, phosphorus, or PTH. In 
      the logistic regression analysis, independent indicators of PAD risk were male sex, 
      age, and lower CrCl. Twelve percent of patients had an ABI > or =1.3, suggestive of 
      parietal arterial calcifications. In these patients, systolic blood pressure and 
      pulse pressure were lower (126 +/- 18 vs. 150 +/- 27, P= 0.005, and 52 +/- 13 vs. 68 
      +/- 25 mm Hg, P= 0.044), i-PTH levels were higher (228 +/- 267 vs. 117 +/- 63 pg/mL, 
      P= 0.01), and a larger proportion of this group was treated with calcitriol (34% vs. 
      13%) compared to patients with a normal ABI. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of PAD, 
      considered as an ABI <0.9, was demonstrated in nondialyzed patients with CKD. This 
      was related with age, male sex, and higher degree of renal insufficiency, while the 
      presence of ABI > or =1.3 was associated with a greater degree of 
      hyperparathyroidism. These data show the need to carry out routine ABI 
      determinations in patients with CKD for early detection of peripheral arterial 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and cardiovascular events are common in 
      hemodialysis patients. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) 
      plays an important role in vascular calcification and bone remodeling. This study 
      investigates the effects of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) on cardiovascular events in 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Serum sRANKL levels of 47 patients were tested by 
      ELISA. Vascular calcification was radiographically measured and patients were 
      followed up for 2 years. RESULTS: After 2 years, 10 (36.6%) patients had experienced 
      cardiovascular events. Seventy-five percent (6/9) of mortality was due to 
      cardiovascular disease. Patients experiencing cardiovascular events showed 
      significantly higher vascular calcification scores (VCS) (3.20 +/- 2.74 vs. 1.19 +/- 
      1.60; t = 2.999; p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum 
      sRANKL levels, vascular calcification scores and phosphorus were independent 
      determinants of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Serum sRANKL levels and VCS are 
      independent risk factors, and hemodialysis patients with low serum sRANKL levels 
      have a risk of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Vitamin K status and mortality after kidney transplantation: a cohort study.
PG  - 474-83

LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2014.09.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors 
      such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K 
      insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) 
      years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation. FACTOR: 
      Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K 
      status. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant failure. RESULTS: At inclusion, 
      median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients 
      having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median 
      follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) 
      developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at 
      considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile 
      (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). 
      After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion 
      of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained 
      significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing 
      transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs 
      Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney 
      function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7). 
      LIMITATIONS: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No 
      data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, 
      is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated 
      independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address 
      whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Circulating sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) in predialysis chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD): relationship with bone density and arterial stiffness.
PG  - 473-80
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9595-4 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. The 
      Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in 
      CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible association of circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signaling 
      inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in predialysis CKD. 
      Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B 
      (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were 
      analyzed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip 
      (TH), and forearm (FARM). Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour 
      analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between 
      sclerostin and age (r = 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p 
      = 0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association 
      between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between 
      sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In 
      contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative 
      association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the 
      Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to 
      establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in 
      CKD.

TI  - Relationship of estimated GFR and coronary artery calcification in the CRIC (Chronic 
      Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.
PG  - 519-26
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased 
      mortality risk in the general population. Although individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) are at markedly increased mortality risk, the incidence, prevalence, 
      and prognosis of CAC in CKD are not well understood. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 1,908 participants who 
      underwent coronary calcium scanning as part of the multiethnic CRIC (Chronic Renal 
      Insufficiency Cohort) Study. PREDICTOR: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      computed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, 
      stratified by race, sex, and diabetic status. eGFR was treated as a continuous and a 
      categorical variable compared with the reference value of >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). 
      MEASUREMENTS: CAC detected using computed tomography (CT) using either an Imatron 
      C-300 electron beam computed tomography (CT) scanner or multidetector CT scanner. 
      CAC was computed using Agatston score as a categorical variable. Analyses were 
      performed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We found a strong and graded 
      relationship between lower eGFR and increasing CAC. In unadjusted models, ORs 
      increased from 1.68 (95% CI, 1.23-2.31) for eGFR of 50-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 2.82 
      (95% CI, 2.06-3.85) for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable adjustment only 
      partially attenuated the results (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.20) for eGFR <30 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2). LIMITATIONS: Use of eGFR rather than measured GFR. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      showed a graded relationship between severity of CKD and CAC independent of 
      traditional risk factors. These findings support recent guidelines that state that 
      if vascular calcification is present, it should be considered as a complementary 
      component to be included in the decision making required for individualizing CKD 
      treatment.

LID - 10.1159/000355859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and vascular calcifications (VC) in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 55 PD patients who 
      underwent pelvic X-ray to assess for VC. Patients with and without linear 
      calcifications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (27.3%) had linear 
      calcifications on pelvic X-ray. FGF-23 levels were higher in patients with VC (299.5 
      (30.4-2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8-1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic patients had lower 
      FGF-23 values (43.2 (14.9-134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8-2,410) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Patients 
      with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF-23 levels (70.6 (14.8-513) vs. 
      179.5 (30.4-2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not reach statistical 
      significance. FGF-23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis duration and HbA1c were 
      positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and ALP were negatively 
      associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF-23 levels, age, dialysis 
      duration and RRF to be associated with VC. CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 levels are associated 
      with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed to clarify whether it is simply a 
      marker or a potential factor. It may prove to be an important therapeutic target for 
      VC management.

TI  - Risk factors for progression of aortic arch calcification in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 460-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2011.00571.x [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an 
      important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using plain 
      chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC 
      progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 
      59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography 
      before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then divided 
      the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of AoAC progression. 
      We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical profiles in the two groups. 
      Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age, 58.6 ± 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients 
      (41.3%) had AoAC before initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 ± 20.4%. The 
      mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 ± 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had 
      progressive AoAC. Age >65 years (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes 
      (p = 0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC 
      progression. No significant association was found between AoAC progression and the 
      baseline clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis 
      modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the presence 
      of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC progression 
      in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the presence of AoAC 
      before initial dialysis were significantly related to the progression of AoAC in 
      these patients. The results suggest that patients should be carefully managed from 
      the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular 
      morbidity.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and matrix-metalloproteinases in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease: are they associated with cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 276-83
LID - 10.1159/000243050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      may be related to mineral disorder and microinflammation. Fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF-23) is a phosphatonin and inhibitor of calcitriol synthesis, which is 
      associated with poor prognosis in CKD patients starting dialysis. 
      Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) contribute to myocardial remodeling and 
      arterial calcification. FGF-23 and MMPs levels are altered in CKD, however, little 
      is known about their association and relation to cardiovascular (CV) disease. 
      METHODS: Standard laboratory parameters, plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, FGF-23, 
      PAPP-A and CV disease history were assessed in 80 patients with CKD 1-5 and 44 
      healthy control subjects. RESULTS: FGF-23 and MMP-2 (assessed by ELISA) were higher 
      in CKD patients compared to controls. FGF-23 increased from CKD 3, whereas MMP-2 
      increased only in CKD 5. FGF-23 was positively associated with MMP-2, adjusted to 
      age, eGFR, phosphatemia, calcitriol and parathormone. FGF-23 independently 
      correlated with parathormone and inversely with calcitriol, whereas MMP-2 was 
      related to phosphatemia. FGF-23 was higher in subjects with a history of CV disease 
      compared to those free of such history (559.0 vs.184.0 RU/ml), adjusted to age and 
      eGFR. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a possible relationship between FGF-23, MMP-2 and 
      CV disease in CKD. Potential causality of this association remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are independent predictors of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy in chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 760-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in HD patients and 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification measured by electron beam computed 
      tomography (EBCT). METHODS: In a cohort of 118 HD patients (52 male, 66 female, mean 
      age: 46+/-13 years), we measured biochemical parameters, including BUN, creatinine, 
      albumin, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, and performed 
      echocardiography, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography and EBCT in 85 of 
      them. The degree of stenosis was measured at four different sites (communis, bulbus, 
      interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. Carotid plaque scores were calculated 
      by summing the degrees of stenosis measured at all locations. RESULTS: LVH was 
      detected in 89 of the patients (75%). Plaque-positive patients had higher left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) than plaque-negative patients (175+/-59 vs 143+/-46 
      g/m2, P = 0.003). LVMI was correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, 
      P<0.001), pulse pressure (r = 0.58, P<0.001), haemoglobin levels (r = - 0.25, P = 
      0.008), carotid plaque score (r = 0.32, P = 0.001) and coronary (CACS) and aortic 
      wall calcification score (AWCS) (r = 0.34, P = 0.002 and r = 0.43, P<0.001, 
      respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis (model r = 0.76) showed the 
      independent factors related to LVMI to be systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, 
      CACS and presence of carotid plaques. CONCLUSION: Extra-coronary atherosclerosis and 
      vascular calcification are associated with LVH in HD patients. Whether the treatment 
      of atherosclerosis or vascular calcification may cause regression of or even prevent 
      LVH in HD patients remains to be seen.

AB  - We previously demonstrated a strong relation between carotid atherosclerosis 
      (defined as carotid artery stenosis > or =50%) and intracranial artery calcification 
      (IAC) in ischemic stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      relation between aortic atherosclerosis and IAC. Four hundred fifty-four patients 
      with ischemic stroke were included. Complex aortic plaques (CAP) were assessed by 
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and defined as plaques > or =4 mm thick or 
      with mobile components in the proximal aorta. IAC were assessed in the seven major 
      cerebral arteries and a semiquantitative score system was applied, ranging from 0 
      (no calcification) to 7. Forty-two patients (9.3%) had CAP. Patients with CAP were 
      older compared with patients without CAP (73.6 vs. 63.6 years, p < 0.001), had more 
      vascular risk factors, more significant carotid artery atherosclerosis (p < 0.001), 
      more chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001), and a higher IAC score (3.0 vs. 1.8; p < 
      0.001). Stepwise logistic regression selected the following independent factors for 
      CAP: previous stroke or TIA (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.0; p = 0.002), carotid artery 
      stenosis > or =50% (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.7-8.0; p = 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR 
      3.8; 95%CI 1.9-7.8; p < 0.001), and IAC score (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-1.9; p = 0.002). 
      IAC was present in 100% of patients with CAP. Moreover, IAC had a high sensitivity 
      (100%) and negative predictive value (100%) for the presence of CAP. In ischemic 
      stroke patients, the absence of IAC strongly points to the lack of CAP. However, 
      these results warrant confirmation in prospective studies before concluding the 
      non-utility of the use of TEE to exclude CAP as a potential source of cerebral 
      embolism in patients without IAC.

TI  - Does hemodiafiltration reduce vascular stiffness measured by aortic pulse wave 
      velocity compared with high-flux hemodialysis?
PG  - 391-5
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12119 [doi]
AB  - Hemodialfiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce the frequency of intradialytic 
      hypotension compared with hemodialysis (HD). We wished to determine whether HDF 
      resulted in improvement of arterial stiffness compared with HD. We reviewed 
      peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements in a cross-sectional 
      analysis of stable HDF and HD outpatients. One hundred forty-one HDF patients were 
      matched to 148 HD patients in terms of age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, peripheral 
      blood pressure, and body mass. Pulse wave velocity was not different between the HD 
      and HDF cohorts (median 9.1 [8.0-10.7] m/s vs. 9.7 [8.5-11.6] m/s). Similarly, there 
      were no differences in central aortic pressure (149.2 ± 30.9 mmHg vs. 151.9 ± 35.2 
      mmHg), or aortic (39 [25.1-51.2]% vs. 38.6 [25.8-51.4]%) and brachial (3.8 [-24.3 to 
      26.9]% vs. 3 [-22.4 to 27.1]%) augmentation indices, respectively. Pulse wave 
      velocity did not differ between adult patients treated by HD and HDF, and similarly, 
      there were no differences in central aortic pressure, aortic or brachial 
      augmentation indices, and cardiac diastolic perfusion. Our study suggests that HDF 
      does not appear to offer any benefit over HD in terms of vascular stiffness.

TI  - Superficial temporal artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: 
      Association with vascular risk factors and ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
PG  - 215-20
LID - 10.4103/0971-3026.85371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA) calcification 
      is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and has unknown 
      ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We sought to determine 
      the association between the risk factors for vascular calcification and this rare 
      phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure, and to assess the coexistence of 
      cerebral ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records and laboratory data on 
      risk factors for vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 
      patients with a discharge diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head 
      examinations were reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk 
      factors for the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) 
      cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes). RESULTS: STA 
      calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of 
      cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% 
      (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208; 
      P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The risk 
      of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to STA calcification (P=0.221). 
      CONCLUSION: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the risk of 
      STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, hypertension, serum 
      calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are not. The risk of cerebral 
      ischemia is not related to STA calcification but has the strongest association with 
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Electron-beam computerized tomography correlates with coronary angiogram in chronic 
      kidney disease patients.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Electron-beam computerized tomography (EBCT) is able to 
      noninvasively quantify coronary artery calcification (CAC). Chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients frequently have CAC, and clinicians are puzzled regarding the 
      clinical significance of this finding and the diagnostic accuracy of coronary EBCT 
      in CKD. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation in CKD patients 
      between CAC measured by EBCT and 50% stenosis determined by coronary angiography 
      (CA), the gold standard to identify atherosclerotic lesions. METHOD: We recruited 37 
      patients with CKD from a single institution and compared their coronary EBCT and CA 
      results using standard statistical analysis. RESULTS: Patients with at least one 
      vessel with > or = 50% stenosis by CA had higher mean CAC scores [2,407.9 +/- (SD) 
      3,165.3 vs. 227 +/- 443.4; p < 0.001] and higher median CAC scores (1,052 vs. 25.8; 
      p < 0.001) as compared with those having no stenosis > or = 50%. The sensitivity was 
      85.7%, and the specificity 82.6% using 50% stenosis as the definition for coronary 
      artery disease and using a CAC score of 400 as a cutoff value for the EBCT results. 
      The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84. The diagnostic 
      accuracy (proportion of correct results) was 83.8%. The negative predictive value 
      was 90.5%. The receiver operating characteristic curve suggests that the optimal 
      cutoff value for CAC scores in our cohort is 315.9, increasing the area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve to 0.91. The total coronary artery stenosis 
      was significantly associated with the CAC score (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EBCT has a 
      very good predictive value for obstructive coronary artery disease. EBCT could be 
      used as a screening tool in CKD patients with a low-to-intermediate risk for 
      coronary artery disease.

TI  - Vitamin k intake and plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein levels in 
      kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - e47991
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047991 [doi]
LID - e47991
AB  - Vitamin K is essential for activation of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins including 
      the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla-protein (MGP). Insufficient vitamin 
      K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly inactive proteins and 
      contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney transplant recipients, 
      cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K intake and status have not been defined. 
      We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular vitamin K status and its 
      determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We estimated vitamin K intake in a 
      cohort of kidney transplant recipients (n = 60) with stable renal function 
      (creatinine clearance 61 [42-77] (median [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 
      [35-188] months after transplantation, using three-day food records and food 
      frequency questionnaires. Vascular vitamin K status was assessed by measuring plasma 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below the 
      recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with 
      less consumption of green vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased dp-ucMGP 
      levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p<0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP levels were elevated (>500 
      pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified creatinine clearance, 
      coumarin use, body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and sodium excretion as 
      independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a considerable part of the kidney 
      transplant population, vitamin K intake is too low for maximal carboxylation of 
      vascular MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may result in an increased risk for arterial 
      calcification. Whether increasing vitamin K intake may have health benefits for 
      kidney transplant recipients should be addressed by future studies.

TI  - Fetuin-A serum levels are not correlated to kidney function in long-lived subjects.
PG  - 637-40
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.02.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Serum Fetuin A has been identified as an inhibitor of ectopic 
      calcification. It is reduced in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it 
      has been proposed as a potential link between CKD and the higher prevalence of 
      arterial calcification observed in these patients. During aging both the stiffening 
      of arterial wall due to calcification and a decline in kidney function are frequent. 
      The aim of the study is to investigate if Fetuin A serum levels are associated with 
      aging and with AHSG T256S polymorphism. Moreover, we aim at investigate whether 
      serum Fetuin A is correlated to kidney function in this setting of senescence. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: 256 health long-lived subjects (age 92 [81-100]) were recruited 
      for the study. Serum Fetuin A was evaluated by ELISA, Cystatin C by 
      immune-nephelometry. AHSG T256S was determinated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Serum Fetuin 
      A shows a significant correlation with age (r=0.20; P=0.0048). AHSG TS and SS 
      genotypes are associated to lower levels of serum protein (0.27 [0.19-0.29] g/L vs 
      0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; P<0.027 and 0.34 [0.25-0.41] g/L vs 0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; 
      P<0.001, respectively). No significant correlation between Fetuin A and Cystatin C 
      was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Serum Fetuin A increases with age in elder individuals 
      and subjects with the TS or SS AHSG polymorphism have lower levels of the 
      circulating protein. No correlation with kidney function decline was observed. Other 
      mechanisms should be investigated to explain the increase of Fetuin A with age.

TI  - Interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are associated with risk of vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification is a common complication among dialysis patients and 
      its pathogenesis involves a variety of factors. The roles of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines and residual kidney function (RKF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients 
      with vascular calcification have not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 
      stable PD patients were enrolled. All patients had plain X-ray film examination 
      including chest (posterior-anterior view, CXR) and pelvis. Vascular calcification 
      was interpreted as calcified deposit over aortic arch and linear calcification of 
      pelvic arteries. Relevant biochemical data, pro-inflammatory markers, and PD-related 
      factors were measured and collected. RESULTS: Vascular calcification prevalence in 
      CXRs was higher than that in pelvis films (38.2% vs. 22.3%, p < 0.05). Patients with 
      vascular calcification in CXR had higher incidence of calcification in pelvis films 
      (p < 0.05). Only a minor portion (14.6%) had two calcification sites. Regression 
      analysis revealed that age, PD duration, body mass index, and RKF were independent 
      factors associated with vascular calcification in CXR. Age, diabetes, IL-10 and RKF 
      were factors associated in pelvis films. Factors independently related to vascular 
      calcification in both films were age, duration, diabetes, IL-10, and RKF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Besides traditional risk factors, IL-10 and RKF were important factors 
      associated with vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and mortality in diabetic patients with proteinuria.
PG  - 1107-14
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.70 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk 
      associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and 
      often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the 
      prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 
      diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric 
      diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). 
      Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was 
      diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, 
      male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an 
      average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the 
      severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on 
      both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of 
      calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the 
      severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney 
      disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need 
      to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification 
      in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

TI  - Evolution of coronary artery calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      Stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 2582-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq751 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to report the evolution of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 comparing 
      those with and without diabetes. We previously reported prevalence in the same 
      population. METHODS: CAC was measured using multi-slice computer tomography. We 
      prospectively followed up 103 patients for 2 years, 49 with diabetes and 54 without 
      diabetes. Demographic, routine biochemistry, calcification inhibitors and bone 
      mineral density data were collected and analysed. Evolution of CAC was defined as 
      those with a difference of ≥ 2.5 U between baseline and final square root CAC 
      scores. RESULTS: There were more progressors in the group with diabetes, 24 compared 
      to 12 in the group without diabetes (P= 0.004). When diabetes was present, CAC 
      progressed equally in men and women. Risk factors for evolution of CAC included age, 
      baseline CAC score and serum phosphate levels. Baseline CAC score, phosphate and 
      body mass index were independent predictors for the increase of CAC score during the 
      study period. Severity of CAC was greater in the diabetes group (median CAC score at 
      baseline in the group with diabetes 154 increased to 258 2 years later, P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evolution of CAC is greater in older patients and those with diabetes, 
      where the gender advantage of being female is lost. Serum phosphate level, despite 
      being within the normal range and virtually no use of phosphate binders, was also a 
      risk factor. Further studies are required to determine the levels of serum phosphate 
      required to minimize cardiovascular risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic 
      kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests 
      correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D) levels<30ng/mL in patients treated with 
      maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a specific treatment protocol. STUDY 
      DESIGN: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial followed by a 
      26-week open-label study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 55 adult maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients with 25(OH)D levels<30ng/mL were recruited from June 2008 through 
      October 2009. INTERVENTION: Cholecalciferol, 25,000IU, per week orally versus 
      placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of individualized cholecalciferol prescription 
      based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality 
      Initiative) guidelines. OUTCOMES: Primary end point was the percentage of patients 
      with 25(OH)D levels≥30ng/mL at 13 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the percentage 
      of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 
      blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and 
      hypervitaminosis D. MEASUREMENTS: Blood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; 
      iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, 
      trimonthly; fetuin A and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and 
      aortic calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39. RESULTS: The primary 
      end point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo 
      group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P<0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 
      11 [IQR, 10-15]pg/mL; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target 
      calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P=0.03). Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphate and 
      iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26-week study phase did not 
      significantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level≥30ng/mL in patients issued from 
      the placebo group. LIMITATIONS: Small size of the study population. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Oral weekly administration of 25,000IU of cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an 
      effective, safe, inexpensive, and manageable way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D 
      levels in hemodialysis patients. Further evaluation of clinical end points is 
      suggested.

TI  - Serum S100A12 and Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification Over 4 Years in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 4-13
LID - 10.1159/000438869 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is common and contributes to increased 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this prospective study, 
      we aimed to investigate the associations of serum S100A12 in the presence of severe 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) and the progression of CAC in HD patients. 
      METHODS: Sixty maintenance HD patients and 30 controls were enrolled. Serum S100A12 
      levels were measured using ELISA. CAC scores (CACs) were measured twice at a 4-year 
      interval using multislice spiral CT. The HD patients were classified as rapid 
      progressors or slow progressors according to the change in the CACs across these 2 
      measurements (x0394;CACs). RESULTS: The incidences of rapid progression of CAC in 
      patients with baseline CACs ≤10, CACs >10 and CACs >400 were 12.5, 40.0 and 64.3%, 
      respectively. Both baseline and 4-year serum S100A12 levels were significantly 
      higher in the rapid progressors than in the slow progressors (medians of 45.6 vs. 
      30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001 and 62.3 vs. 39.4 ng/ml, p = 0.002, respectively). The serum 
      S100A12 levels were significantly correlated with baseline CACs (r = 0.466, p < 
      0.001), 4-year CACs (r = 0.440, p < 0.001) and x0394;CACs (r = 0.392, p < 0.001). 
      Importantly, the x0394;CACs were significantly correlated with x0394;S100A12 levels 
      (r = 0.396, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the serum S100A12 
      level was as an independent determinant of the presence of severe CAC and that the 
      increment in the serum S100A12 level was a factor that was significantly 
      independently associated with the progression of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S100A12 
      levels were significantly associated with the presence of severe CAC, and the 
      increment in serum S100A12 levels was an independent determinant of the progression 
      of CAC.

TI  - FGF-23 and osteoprotegerin are independently associated with myocardial damage in 
      chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Another link between chronic kidney 
      disease-mineral bone disorder and the heart.
PG  - 727-33

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-skeletal calcification and disordered phosphate metabolism are 
      hallmarks of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are increased in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and have been associated with arterial and cardiac dysfunction and 
      reduced survival. Troponin T (cTnT) is released from cardiac myocytes under 
      conditions of stress and is predictive of mortality across a range of renal 
      functions. However, the utility of this biomarker was formerly limited by the lower 
      limit of assay detection. The introduction of a high-sensitivity assay has enabled 
      more detailed study of myocyte stress below the previous limit of detection. We 
      studied the association of mediators of CKD-MBD with arterial stiffness and also of 
      these mediators and arterial stiffness with myocardial damage in patients with CKD 
      stages 3-4. METHODS: OPG and FGF-23 were measured in 200 CKD stages 3-4 patients. 
      cTnT was measured using a high-sensitivity assay. Aortic stiffness was assessed 
      using aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV). RESULTS: Mean age was 69 ± 11 years, mean 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 151 ± 22/81 ± 11 mmHg and renal function 
      was 33 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m(2). OPG, FGF-23, high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) and 
      APWV all correlated with renal function. After multivariate analysis, OPG and age 
      remained independently associated with aortic stiffness. OPG and FGF-23 were 
      independently associated with hs-cTnT in addition to other non-traditional risk 
      factors (Model R(2) = 0.596). CONCLUSION: We have shown that changes in bone 
      mediators and phosphate metabolism induced by CKD are independently associated with 
      vascular and cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Our findings suggest that cardiac 
      dysfunction may be specifically associated with such abnormalities in addition to 
      recognized increases in vascular stiffness.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in 
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly 
      recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels 
      of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study 
      investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with 
      all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc 
      survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 
      2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters 
      of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum 
      sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: 
      Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] 
      pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older 
      age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a 
      median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels 
      were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum 
      sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When 
      bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the 
      causal pathway.

AB  - Patients surviving more than 10 years on hemodialysis (HD) are at risk of developing 
      serious morbidity from unrelated conditions and from the many complications of 
      long-term dialysis, such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
      malignant tumors ectopic vascular calcification, diabetes mellitus, and disuse 
      atrophy of the bladder. Long-term dialysis affects transplant patient outcomes and 
      long-term graft survival. We analyzed 436 patients who underwent kidney 
      transplantations between January 1987 and December 2007 to determine the impact of 
      long-term dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes. The 39 patients who had been 
      treated pretransplantation with dialysis for more than 10 years had an average 
      length of dialysis treatment of 15.8 years (range, 10.0-32.5 years); they were 
      denoted as the long-term hemodialysis group. The remaining 397 recipients showed an 
      average of 3.7 years period of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (range, 0-9.8, years; 
      short-term hemodialysis group). There were significant differences in patient 
      survival rates between the 2 groups: 93.2% vs 98.6%, at 1 year; 79.3% vs 95.4% at 5 
      years; and 58.4% vs 93.1% at 10 years (P = .0034). Also, graft survival was 
      significantly different between the 2 groups: 89.2% vs 95.8% at 1 year; 60.4% vs 
      88.5% at 5 years; and 33.4% vs 80.4% at 10 years (P = .0026). Our results suggest 
      that dialysis treatment for more than 10 years produces negative effects on 
      post-transplantation patient and graft survival.

      subclinical atheromatosis in a Spanish chronic kidney disease cohort: baseline data 
      from the NEFRONA study.
PG  - 168

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events (CVE) are more prevalent in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of morbimortality. Specific 
      risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional factors do not 
      fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of 
      atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The potential use 
      of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis has to be determined. 
      METHODS: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were 
      enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. 
      Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no 
      previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were also recruited. Demographical, clinical and 
      analytical data were collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a 
      single trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect 
      atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured. RESULTS: Differences 
      in age, sex and prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found 
      between controls and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described 
      in epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls 
      and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted); 
      earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of atheromatous 
      plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted analysis. A group of 
      patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, 
      and would have gone underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of 
      pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages, 
      and a higher rate of ABI >1.4 than <0.9, suggesting more vascular calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual prevalence of 
      subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of 
      atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important 
      information to the pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to 
      non-CKD subjects.

TI  - Coronary artery, aortic wall, and valvular calcification in nondialyzed individuals 
      with type 2 diabetes and renal disease.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly prevalent 
      and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook this study to test the 
      hypothesis that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often severe long 
      before diabetic renal disease progresses to ESRD. METHODS: A total of 32 nondialyzed 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic renal disease (albumin 
      excretion rate>30 microg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49.8 +/- 6.1 
      mL/min/1.73 m2] were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric 
      diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls without renal 
      disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the presence/absence of 
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: Using 
      electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification was significantly greater among diabetic renal disease individuals 
      (prevalence, 94% vs. 59%, P < 0.001; median score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0.001) than the 
      nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification scores were significantly 
      more severe among diabetic renal disease individuals than either the diabetic or 
      nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic renal disease, the coronary 
      artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were several-fold greater 
      among those with known CAD than among those without. There was also a significantly 
      greater prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification among diabetic renal 
      disease individuals than nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23% vs. 6%, P = 0.03; mitral, 
      25% vs. 2%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced 
      these findings and also consistently identified age and diabetic renal disease as 
      additional predictors for the presence or severity of coronary artery and aortic 
      wall calcification. CONCLUSION: In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed 
      individuals with diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that vascular and 
      valvular calcification is present and often severe long before the disease 
      progresses to ESRD. The data also suggest that the coronary artery and aortic wall 
      calcification may represent atherosclerosis.

TI  - Relationship between sclerostin and cardiovascular calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 219
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-219 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity 
      and bone turnover. Here, we assessed the potential association of sclerostin with 
      the development of coronary artery (CAC) and aortic valve calcifications (AVC) in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-slice 
      computed tomography (MS-CT) scanning study in 67 chronic HD patients (59.4 ± 14.8 
      yrs) for measurement of CAC and AVC. We tested established biomarkers as well as 
      serum sclerostin (ELISA) regarding their association to the presence of 
      calcification. Fifty-four adults without relevant renal disease served as controls 
      for serum sclerostin levels. Additionally, sclerostin expression in explanted aortic 
      valves from 15 dialysis patients was analysed ex vivo by immunohistochemistry and 
      mRNA quantification (Qt-RT-PCR). RESULTS: CAC (Agatston score > 100) and any AVC 
      were present in 65% and in 40% of the MS-CT patient group, respectively. Serum 
      sclerostin levels (1.53 ± 0.81 vs 0.76 ± 0.31 ng/mL, p < 0.001) were significantly 
      elevated in HD compared to controls and more so in HD patients with AVC versus those 
      without AVC (1.78 ± 0.84 vs 1.35 ± 0.73 ng/mL, p = 0.02). Multivariable regression 
      analysis for AVC revealed significant associations with higher serum sclerostin. Ex 
      vivo analysis of uraemic calcified aortic valves (n = 10) revealed a strong 
      sclerostin expression very close to calcified regions (no sclerostin staining in 
      non-calcified valves). Correspondingly, we observed a highly significant 
      upregulation of sclerostin mRNA in calcified valves compared to non-calcified 
      control valves. CONCLUSION: We found a strong association of sclerostin with 
      calcifying aortic heart valve disease in haemodialysis patients. Sclerostin is 
      locally produced in aortic valve tissue adjacent to areas of calcification.

LID - 10.1159/000366449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of bone formation, but the meaning of 
      its serum levels remains undetermined. We evaluated the association between 
      sclerostin levels and clinical or biological data in hemodialyzed patients (HD), 
      notably parathormone (PTH), biomarkers of bone turnover, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality after 2 years. METHODS: 164 HD patients were included in this 
      observational study. The calcification score was assessed with the Kauppila method. 
      Patients were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: Median sclerostin levels were 
      significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in HD versus healthy subjects (n = 94) (1,375 vs. 
      565 pg/ml, respectively). In univariate analysis a significant association (p < 
      0.05) was found between sclerostin and age, height, dialysis vintage, albumin, 
      troponin, homocysteine, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I, 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteoprotegerin, but not with the 
      calcification score. In a multivariate model, the association remained with age, 
      height, dialysis vintage, troponin, homocysteine, phosphate, PTH, but also with 
      vascular calcifications. Association was positive for all variables, except PTH and 
      vascular calcifications. The baseline sclerostin concentration was not different in 
      survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a higher concentration of 
      sclerostin in HD patients, a positive association with age and a negative 
      association with PTH. A positive association with phosphate, homocysteine and 
      troponin calls for additional research. The clinical interest of sclerostin to 
      assess vascular calcifications in HD is limited and no association was found between 
      sclerostin and mortality.

TI  - Relation of aortic valve and coronary artery calcium in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease to the stage and etiology of the renal disease.
PG  - 1473-7
LID - 10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.01.396 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic renal failure have increased cardiac calcium loads. Previous 
      studies have investigated the prevalence and quantitative extent of aortic valve 
      calcium (AVC) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with various stages of 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the impact of preexisting atherosclerosis on 
      the calcification burden has not been clarified. Therefore, this study was conducted 
      to examine the effect of CKD stage as well as the primary cause of renal failure 
      (atherosclerotic vs nonatherosclerotic) on AVC and CAC. Twenty-two, 13, and 28 
      patients with stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD, respectively, were included, of whom 24 had 
      atherosclerotic CKD. Patients underwent electron-beam computed tomography to assess 
      AVC and CAC. AVC was present in 27% of patients with stage 3 CKD, in 38% of patients 
      with stage 4 CKD, and in 43% of patients with stage 5 CKD. CAC was present in 77% of 
      patients with stage 3 CKD, in 54% of patients with stage 4 CKD, and in 64% of 
      patients with stage 5 CKD. There was no correlation between CKD stage and the 
      quantitative extent of AVC and CAC. AVC was more frequent (58% vs 23%, p <0.01) and 
      more extensive (median score 43 [range 0 to 494] vs 0 [range 0 to 8], p <0.01) in 
      patients with CKD caused by atherosclerotic renal disease than in patients with 
      nonatherosclerotic causes of CKD. CAC was more frequent (83% vs 56%, p <0.05) and 
      more extensive (median score 437 [range 61 to 1,565] vs 31 [range 0 to 155], p 
      <0.001) in patients with atherosclerotic causes of CKD than in patients with CKD 
      caused by nonatherosclerotic renal disease. In conclusion, the prevalence as well as 
      the severity of AVC and CAC did not vary between patients with stage 3, 4, and 5 
      CKD. Cardiac calcification, both AVC and CAC, were more frequent and more severe in 
      patients with atherosclerotic causes of renal failure. These results suggest that 
      cardiac calcium is related to atherosclerotic burden rather than to the severity of 
      CKD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was 
      to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous fistula 
      AVF (feeding artery and/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral 
      computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). PATIENTS 
      AND METHOD: Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%, mean duration 
      65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were evaluated by CT 
      in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F: 28.9%; mean time on HD 
      53.1 +/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF explorations were 
      performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual machine, GE 
      Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was quantified by CT using the 
      following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications, grade II isolated 
      calcifications (<10 groups of calcification), grade III moderate calcifications 
      (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (>20 groups of 
      calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid 
      hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The same week of CT scanning, 
      we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA 
      (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using 
      the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the 
      same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine, 
      Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded 
      simultaneous with QA. RESULTS: Most pts not showed AVF calcification by CT scan 
      (grade I: 27/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts (18/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF 
      calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III 8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial 
      AVF showed higher mean QA compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus 
      1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +/- 16.2 mmHg) 
      and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between 
      both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any 
      calcification on CT scanning (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 
      63.1 versus 24.6 +/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 
      +/- 61.2 months) and similar QA (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9 ml/min) 
      compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, 
      respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), 
      prevalence of brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were 
      found when comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were 
      obtained when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II: 
      73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and 
      without (grade I) AVF calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The prevalence of AVF 
      calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time on 
      HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis and 
      suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and low vitamin D levels are associated with severe vascular 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 419-426

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major complications 
      of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, which should be 
      prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased risk of VCs and 
      fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and 
      without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the 
      associated risk factors. METHODS: A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were 
      recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney 
      disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected. 
      Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of 
      fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by ≥20 %. In the same radiograph, the 
      length of aortic calcification was also measured. Logistic regression models were 
      applied for evaluating the independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral 
      fractures. RESULTS: In our population VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs 
      (>10 cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 %) than in patients without 
      (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis 
      showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI 2.30-12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 
      2.05, 95 % CI 1.10-3.83) were independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % 
      CI 1.01-1.07) and male gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07-2.90) predicted vertebral 
      fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe 
      VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated 
      with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and 
      associated with older age and male gender.

TI  - Is low magnesium a clue to arteriovenous fistula complications in hemodialysis?
PG  - 773-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1207-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnesium insufficiency is a pro-atherogenic factor involved in endothelial 
      dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and vascular calcification. Our aim was to examine the 
      role of magnesium in the development of arteriovenous fistula complications in 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical investigation of data from 
      88 patients who were divided into two groups: those with and without arteriovenous 
      fistula complications. We examined the influence of sex, demographics, and clinical 
      and laboratory parameters. The existence of fistula stenosis was determined by 
      measuring Doppler flow, while B-mode ultrasound was used to detect plaques and 
      evaluate the carotid artery intima-media thickness. RESULTS: Patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications had significantly higher leukocyte counts (p = 
      0.03), platelet counts (p = 0.03), phosphate concentrations (p = 0.044), and 
      alkaline phosphatase concentrations (p = 0.04). Patients without complications had 
      significantly greater blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula (p < 0.0005), 
      higher magnesium concentrations (p = 0.004), and a lower carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (p = 0.037). The magnesium level was inversely correlated with leukocyte 
      (p = 0.028) and platelet (p = 0.016) counts. The magnesium concentration was 
      significantly lower in patients with carotid artery plaques (p = 0.03). Multiple 
      linear regression, using magnesium as the dependent variable in patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications, indicated statistically significant 
      correlations with platelet (p = 0.005) and leukocyte (p = 0.027) counts and carotid 
      plaques (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Hypomagnesemia is a significant pro-atherogenic 
      factor and an important predictor of arteriovenous fistula complications.

TI  - Serum magnesium is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in the 
      Genetics of Atherosclerotic Disease (GEA) study.
PG  - 22

LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum magnesium is inversely associated to coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney disease. There is little information on this 
      association in a general healthy population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      examine the cross-sectional association of serum magnesium levels with CAC. METHODS: 
      We included 1276 Mexican-mestizo subjects (50 % women), aged 30-75 years, free of 
      symptomatic cardiovascular disease. CAC was quantified by multidetector computed 
      tomography using the method described by Agatston. Cross-sectional associations of 
      serum magnesium with cardiometabolic factors and subclinical atherosclerosis defined 
      as a CAC score > 0, were examined in logistic regression models adjusted for age, 
      sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, physical 
      activity, elevated abdominal visceral tissue, fasting insulin and glucose, alcohol 
      consumption, menopausal status (women only), low (LDL-C) and high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, diuretic use, type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (DM2), and family history of DM2. RESULTS: After full adjustment, subjects 
      in the highest quartile of serum magnesium had 48 % lower odds of hypertension (p = 
      0.028), 69 % lower odds of DM2 (p = 0.003), and 42 % lower odds of CAC score > 0 (p 
      = 0.016) compared to those with the lowest serum magnesium. The analyses also showed 
      that a 0.17 mg/dL (1SD) increment in serum magnesium was independently associated 
      with 16 % lower CAC (OR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.724-0.986). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 
      Mexican-mestizo subjects, low serum magnesium was independently associated to higher 
      prevalence not only of hypertension and DM2, but also to coronary artery 
      calcification, which is a marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Carotid intima media thickness and aortic calcification index closely relate to 
      cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 48-51; discussion 51-2
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2007.01925.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Atherosclerosis can be evaluated by carotid intima media thickness (IMT), the 
      aortic calcification index (ACI), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). We investigated 
      which test was most closely related to cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders (CCVD) 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Maximum IMT (max-IMT), ACI, and PWV were examined 
      in 110 hemodialysis patients, using carotid ultrasonography, abdominal CT and a 
      blood pressure pulse wave instrument, respectively. Blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
      serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, total 
      protein, albumin, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha were measured. The patients were divided into two groups; with and 
      without CCVD and the degree of atherosclerosis was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: 
      Compared to the CCVD (-) group, the CCVD (+) group showed significantly higher 
      percentages of males and diabetic patients, higher levels of HbA1c (5.14 vs 4.83%) 
      and hs-CRP (0.320 vs 0.167 mg/dL), an older age group (64.5 vs 57.5 years), a 
      greater max-IMT (2.05 vs 1.19 mm), and a higher ACI (71.8 vs 41.0%); and 
      significantly lower diastolic blood pressure (82.8 vs 89.2 mmHg). Multiple logistic 
      regression analysis showed that the factors influencing the development of CCVD were 
      age (odds ratio: 1.092), ACI (odds ratio: 1.025), and max-IMT (odds ratio: 2.006). 
      However, PWV did not significantly relate to CCVD. CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis 
      patients, the ACI and max-IMT were significantly associated with CCVD, but the 
      association of PWV was weak. A prospective cohort study is warranted to determine 
      the risk factors for CCVD in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
      with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-41
LID - 10.5414/CN108716 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role 
      of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess 
      the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular 
      calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients. METHODS: Left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D echocardiography. Intact FGF23 
      blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, 
      USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial 
      stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). 
      Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragão score. RESULTS: In 
      unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 
      0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), 
      dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was 
      negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = 
      -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted 
      analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (β = 
      0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, 
      gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic 
      blood pressure. There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in 
      multivariable- adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is 
      associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or 
      vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Elevated osteoprotegerin levels predict cardiovascular events in new hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 257-63
LID - 10.1159/000157629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular 
      events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement of 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the incidence of 
      cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients. METHODS: We conducted a 
      prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with morbidity and 
      mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 and May 2006. 
      RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 34 female) were 
      prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this period, 27 patients 
      developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related to cardiovascular 
      disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the high OPG group 
      showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with 
      the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis associated the new onset of 
      cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 
      0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start of HD was significantly 
      associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic calcification index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients may predict subsequent 
      cardiovascular events.

LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9655-9 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 
      contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor 
      activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic 
      mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using the 
      SM22α promoter (SM22α-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old male 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium levels but 
      lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and gender-matched 
      wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent of weight) of the 
      leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not significantly different. No 
      significant differences in these parameters were observed in female mice. 
      Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits in the aortic roots of 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic differentiation and 
      mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were 
      isolated and cultured. Results showed that SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs had higher 
      baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but not baseline matrix calcification. 
      When induced by the PKA agonist forskolin, ALP activity was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( 
      tg ) than in WT SMCs. Real-time RT-qPCR revealed higher baseline expression of ALP 
      and ankylosis genes but lower osteoprotegerin gene in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. 
      Matrix mineralization induced by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP inhibitor 
      levamisole abolished forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not inorganic 
      phosphate-induced matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that RANKL 
      overexpression in the vasculature may promote mineralization potential.

TI  - Matrix GLA protein gene polymorphisms: clinical correlates and cardiovascular 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased vascular calcification plays an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It 
      is the result of an active ossification process counteracted by 'protective' 
      proteins, such as matrix GLA protein (MGP). Polymorphisms of MGP have been 
      identified. METHODS: The aim of this study was to define the distribution of two MGP 
      polymorphisms (-7, -138) in 99 hemodialysis (HD) patients, in 26 patients with CKD 
      stage 3 and in 135 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were followed up 
      for 12 months to record any cardiovascular deaths. The cause of death was determined 
      by medical doctors, considering the medical history of each patient. The primers 
      were designed with Primer Express software. RESULTS: MGP -138TT homozygotes were 
      more frequent in the HD group versus controls (p = 0.0004). Additionally, the 
      frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in the HD group (p = 0.0006). The 
      frequency of the A allele of MGP-7 was significantly higher both in the HD group (p 
      = 0.033) and in the CKD group (p = 0.0017) versus controls. MGP-7 GG homozygotes 
      were significantly less common in the CKD group than in controls (p = 0.037). 
      Combination -138TT -7AA was significantly more frequent in both CKD patients (p = 
      0.001) and in HD patients (p = 0.029) than in controls. Seventeen out of 99 HD 
      patients experienced fatal cardiovascular events. Sixteen (94.1%) were -138TT 
      homozygotes and either -7AA homozygotes or -7GA heterozygotes. CONCLUSION: This 
      study suggests that CKD and HD patients have a different distribution of MGP gene 
      polymorphism as compared with the normal population. Altered MGP gene polymorphism 
      may be a negative prognostic factor for the progression to end-stage renal disease 
      and for cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor limits pulse-wave velocity and aortic 
      calcification in a rat model of cystic renal disease.
PG  - F959-66

AB  - The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on function and structure of 
      the aorta was studied in the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of cystic renal 
      disease and Lewis controls. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was recorded under urethane 
      anesthesia (1.3 g/kg ip) in mixed-sex animals aged 6 and 12 wk and in 12-wk-old 
      animals treated with perindopril (3 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) po) from age 6-12 wk. 
      Tail-cuff systolic pressures were recorded over the treatment period. After PWV 
      measurements, animals were euthanized and the aorta was removed for 
      histomorphological and calcium analysis. Hypertension in LPK at 6 and 12 wk was 
      associated with a shift of the PWV curve upward and to the right, indicating a 
      decrease in aortic compliance, which was significantly reduced by perindopril. LPK 
      demonstrated greater aortic calcification (6 wk: 123 ± 19 vs. 65 ± 7 and 12 wk: 406 
      ± 6 vs. 67 ± 6 μmol/g, P < 0.001, LPK vs. Lewis, respectively). This was reduced by 
      treatment with perindopril (172 ± 48 μmol/g, 12 wk LPK P < 0.001). Medial 
      cross-sectional area and elastic modulus/wall stress of the aorta were greater in 
      LPK vs. Lewis control animals at 6 and 12 wk of age and showed an age-related 
      increase that was prevented by treatment with perindopril (P < 0.001). Perindopril 
      also ameliorated the degradation of elastin, increase in collagen content, and 
      medial elastocalcinosis seen in 12-wk LPK. Overall, perindopril improved the 
      structural and functional indices of aortic stiffness in the LPK rats, demonstrating 
      a capacity for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to limit vascular remodeling 
      in chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Aortic and large artery compliance in end-stage renal failure.
PG  - 137-42
AB  - Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the aorta, right leg and arm of 90 control 
      subjects (CS) and 92 hemodialysis patients (HD) of the same age and mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP). Blood chemistry, including blood lipids, and echographic dimensions 
      of the aorta, were measured in all subjects. Presence of aortic calcification was 
      evaluated by abdominal X-ray and echography. Whereas femoral and brachial PWV were 
      only slightly increased in HD (P less than 0.05), the aortic PWV was significantly 
      elevated (1113 +/- 319 cm/sec) in comparison with CS (965 +/- 216 cm/sec; P = 
      0.0016). Aortic diameters were larger in HD, both at the root of aorta (32.7 +/- 4 
      vs. 28.2 +/- 2.8 mm; P less than 0.0001) and aortic bifurcation (16.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 
      14.6 +/- 2.2 mm; P less than 0.0001). Although the MAP was similar in HD (109.9 +/- 
      19.3 mm Hg) and CS (110.2 +/- 17.2 mm Hg), the pulse pressure was significantly 
      increased in HD patients (76.6 +/- 23.7 vs. 63.9 +/- 22 mm Hg; P = 0.007). In the 
      two populations, aortic PWV was found to increase with age (P less than 0.0001) and 
      MAP (P less than 0.0001). The presence of aortic calcification showed only a 
      borderline relationship with the increase in aortic PWV (P = 0.050 in CS and P = 
      0.069 in HD). As change in PWV is directly related to change in distensibility, and 
      the aortic diameters were increased in HD, these results indicate that aortic wall 
      compliance is decreased in HD, resulting in an increase in the pulsatile component 
      of arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PG  - 256-63

AB  - Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is associated with ischemic stroke in the 
      general population but this relationship has not been examined in hemodialysis 
      patients. We examined the factors associated with IAC and its relationship with 
      acute ischemic stroke in this population. We retrospectively studied 490 head 
      computed tomographic scans from 2225 hemodialysis patients presenting with 
      neurological symptoms at our center (October 2005-May 2009). Intracranial arterial 
      calcification was graded using a validated scoring system. Multivariate regression 
      was used to examine the factors associated with the presence of IAC, its severity, 
      and its ability to predict acute ischemic stroke. Weibull's survival models analyzed 
      the relationship between IAC severity and survival. Ninety-five percent of patients 
      with ischemic stroke had IAC vs. 83% in the nonstroke group (P=0.02). Intracranial 
      arterial calcification severity increased with age (P<0.001), hemodialysis vintage 
      (P<0.001), serum phosphate (P<0.05), and major comorbidities. In patients with 
      multiple computed tomographic scans during the study period, increased IAC severity 
      at baseline was predictive of acute ischemic stroke (P=0.05) on logistic regression 
      analysis. High-grade and not low-grade IAC was associated with worse survival 
      (P=0.008). Intracranial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis 
      patients, especially in those with acute ischemic stroke. Its severity is 
      prognostically significant and associated with risk factors for vascular 
      calcification and may confer a greater risk of acute ischemic stroke. The mechanisms 
      underlying the high incidence of ischemic stroke in this patient group require 
      further comprehensive study.

TI  - Safety of warfarin therapy in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort 
      study.
PG  - 787-794
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study to assess the safety 
      of warfarin therapy in Japanese hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Chronic HD 
      patients on warfarin therapy (warfarin users) were recruited from 111 HD centers in 
      Japan. Two dialysis-vintage-matched warfarin non-users (non-users) were selected 
      from the same HD center as each warfarin user. Clinical data were collected upon 
      registration and every 12 months thereafter for up to 36 months. RESULTS: The final 
      cohort consisted of 365 warfarin users and 692 non-users and was followed for an 
      average of 27.7 months. The mean age of warfarin users (68.8 ± 10.6 years) was 
      significantly higher than that of non-users (66.9 ± 11.0 years, p < 0.001). The 
      analyses by multivariate Cox proportional-hazard models showed that the age [hazard 
      ratio (HR) = 1.07 for each 1-year increase, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.08, 
      p < 0.001] was significantly associated with the death from any cause, but warfarin 
      use (1.08, CI 0.75-1.57, p = 0.68) was not when being adjusted for sex, diabetes 
      mellitus, antiplatelet use, and atrial fibrillation. The risk of composite events, 
      which included death from any cause, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral 
      arterial disease, was also associated with age but was not associated with warfarin 
      use. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that warfarin use by HD 
      patients might not be harmful in chronic state, while the safety for the initiation 
      of warfarin therapy in HD patients remained to be determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have been 
      associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there is no accepted 
      standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications, and most existing methods 
      are simplistic. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a 
      semiquantitative score, one that accounts for all visible calcium on 
      echocardiography, could predict all-cause mortality and stroke in a graded fashion. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects derived from a 
      general echocardiography database. A global cardiac calcium score (GCCS) was applied 
      that assigned points for calcification in the aortic root and valve, mitral annulus 
      and valve, and submitral apparatus, and points for restricted leaflet mobility. The 
      primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was stroke. 
      RESULTS: Over a mean 3.8 ± 1.7 years of follow-up, there were 116 deaths and 34 
      strokes. Crude mortality increased in a graded fashion with increasing GCCS. In 
      unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, the GCCS was significantly associated with 
      total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.35; P < .0001) and stroke 
      (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = .003). After adjusting for demographic 
      and clinical factors (age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, 
      dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, 
      history of atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke), these associations remained 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: The GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired 
      echocardiograms and has clinically significant associations with total mortality and 
      stroke.

TI  - Is coronary artery calcification associated with vertebral bone density in 
      nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients?
PG  - 1456-62
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10061110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are highly prevalent among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients, and both conditions are strongly associated with higher mortality. The 
      study presented here aimed to investigate whether reduced vertebral bone density 
      (VBD) was associated with the presence of CAC in the earlier stages of CKD. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Seventy-two nondialyzed CKD patients (age 52 
      ± 11.7 years, 70% male, 42% diabetics, creatinine clearance 40.4 ± 18.2 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2)) were studied. VBD and CAC were quantified by computed tomography. 
      RESULTS: CAC > 10 Agatston units (AU) was observed in 50% of the patients (median 
      120 AU [interquartile range 32 to 584 AU]), and a calcification score ≥ 400 AU was 
      found in 19% (736 [527 to 1012] AU). VBD (190 ± 52 Hounsfield units) correlated 
      inversely with age (r = -0.41, P < 0.001) and calcium score (r = -0.31, P = 0.01), 
      and no correlation was found with gender, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, lipid 
      profile, mineral parameters, body mass index, and diabetes. Patients in the lowest 
      tertile of VBD had expressively increased calcium score in comparison to the middle 
      and highest tertile groups. In the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting 
      for confounding variables, low VBD was independently associated with the presence of 
      CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Low VBD was associated with CAC in nondialyzed CKD patients. The 
      authors suggest that low VBD might constitute another nontraditional risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease in CKD.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification on multislice detector-row computed tomography.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the underlying conditions that affect the degree of 
      calcification of carotid arterial plaques, measured quantitatively using 
      multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), and to study the association of 
      carotid calcification with clinical symptomatology. METHODS: We measured the 
      calcification volume of stenotic lesions at the carotid bifurcation using MDCT in 84 
      consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo carotid revascularization. These 
      results were compared with the clinical and radiological characteristics of the 
      patients. RESULTS: On MDCT, calcification in the carotid plaques was present in 78 
      patients (93%). Compared to the other patients, patients in the highest quartile of 
      calcification volume (quartile 4) had higher serum creatinine levels (p < 0.001) and 
      tended to have fewer symptomatic ischemic events in the territory of the affected 
      carotid artery in the preceding 6 months (29 vs. 49%, p = 0.099); in particular, 
      there were fewer transient symptoms (5 vs. 27%, p = 0.032) and symptoms possibly 
      occurring due to local embolism (14 vs. 37%, p = 0.045). On ultrasound, plaque 
      ulceration was less prevalent in patients in quartile 4 than in the remaining 
      patients (5 vs. 29%, p = 0.026), although the severity of carotid stenosis was 
      similar among all the quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: Renal dysfunction was associated with 
      enhanced carotid plaque calcification. Patients with severe carotid calcification 
      were found to have a low risk of recent ischemic stroke, presumably due, in part, to 
      a lower prevalence of emboligenic carotid ulceration. MDCT was valuable for the 
      quantitative evaluation of carotid calcification.

TI  - Adiponectin is associated with early diabetic kidney disease in adults with type 1 
      diabetes: A Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) Study.
PG  - 369-374
LID - S1056-8727(16)30213-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2016.06.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations between elevated adiponectin and end-stage renal disease 
      are well recognized and thought to be at least partially explained by reduced renal 
      clearance. Conversely, the relationship between adiponectin and early diabetic 
      kidney disease (DKD) with preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR), including 
      rapid GFR decline and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. We 
      hypothesized that elevated adiponectin would be associated with early DKD in adults 
      with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Adults with type 1 diabetes (n=646 at baseline, n=525 
      at 6years) had adiponectin and renal function by estimated GFR (eGFR) by CKD-EPI 
      creatinine and albumin-excretion rate (AER) evaluated at baseline and 6years. Linear 
      and logistic models evaluated the associations of baseline adiponectin with AER, 
      macroalbuminuria (AER ≥200μg/min), eGFR, CKD (<60mL/min/1.73m(2)) and rapid GFR 
      decline (>3mL/min/1.73m(2)/year). Models adjusted for age, sex, duration, HbA1c, 
      SBP, LDL-C and current smoking. RESULTS: Compared to non-diabetics, adults with type 
      1 diabetes had significantly higher adiponectin, and the difference remained 
      significant after adjusting for AER and/or eGFR (p<0.0001). Adiponectin at baseline 
      was positively associated with rapid GFR decline (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.53), 
      incident CKD (OR: 1.75, 1.14-2.70), and persistent macroalbuminuria and CKD (OR: 
      1.61, 1.10-2.36) over 6years in adjusted models. The associations also remained 
      significant after further adjustments for CRP, estimated insulin sensitivity and 
      ACEi/ARB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 1 diabetes have higher adiponectin 
      than their non-diabetic peers, and elevated adiponectin at baseline is independently 
      associated with greater odds of developing early DKD over 6years.

TI  - Development of a cardiovascular calcification index using simple imaging tools in 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 508-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in haemodialysis 
      patients and is associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Though cardiac computed 
      tomography (CCT) is accurate, it is not widely available. METHODS: We developed a 
      cardiovascular calcification index (CCI) to predict the presence of CAC for 
      haemodialysis patients using simple in-office techniques. Prevalent haemodialysis 
      patients (n = 140) underwent CCT imaging for CAC, a lateral abdominal X-ray for 
      calcification of the abdominal aorta, an echocardiogram for valvular calcification, 
      and pulse pressure measurement. A CCI was derived by weighting the prevalence rate 
      ratios of CAC > or =1000. Using bootstrap techniques, validation was performed using 
      receiver operator characteristic curves and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Points were 
      assigned for patients' age (60-69 and > or =70 years, 1 and 2 points, respectively), 
      dialysis vintage > or =2 years (1 point), aortic and mitral valve calcification (3 
      and 1 points, respectively), and abdominal aorta X-ray scores of 1-6 and > or =7 (2 
      and 4 points, respectively). Race, sex and pulse pressure did not contribute to the 
      CCI. The CCI ranged from 0 to 11 points. The likelihood ratio of CAC > or =1000 
      associated with CCI scores of 2-4, 5, 6-8 and 9-11 were 1.28, 2.03, 2.94 and 3.83, 
      respectively. Given the prevalence of CAC > or =1000 of 21% in the current study, 
      the probability of having CAC > or =1000 was 26%, 38%, 43% and 50% for participants 
      with CCI scores of 2-4, 5, 6-8, and > or =9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      refinement is needed, the CCI developed in the current study provides an alternative 
      for predicting CAC when CCT is not available.

TI  - Impact of phosphate binder type on coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - AIMS: In individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those undergoing 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common. We 
      hypothesized that, in MHD patients, intake of the calcium-free phosphate binder 
      sevelamer is associated with lower CAC compared to calcium-based phosphate binders 
      (CBPB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of MHD patients, who 
      underwent computerized tomography to assess coronary artery calcium scores (CACS). 
      Patients were stratified into two mutually exclusive groups based on taking only a 
      CBPB vs. sevelamer. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratio 
      (OR) of CACS > or = 400, CACS 100 < or =; CACS < 400, 10 < or =; CACS < 100 vs. CACS 
      < 10. RESULTS: 117 MHD patients were either on a CBPB alone (n = 60) or sevelamer 
      alone (n = 57). Despite increased prevalence of DM in the sevelamer group (58%) as 
      compared to the CBPB group (35%), CACS was significantly lower with sevelamer use 
      (283 + or - 83 vs. 494 + or - 94, p = 0.02). The OR of significant CACS > or =; 400 
      vs. CAC < 10 was 4.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.5 - 9.9, p = 0.008) for CBPB 
      compared with sevelamer, after controlling for case-mix, cholesterol-lowering 
      medication, DM, and inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, significant CAC 
      was significantly more prevalent among MHD patients taking CBPB as compared to 
      sevelamer monotherapy.

TI  - Elevated osteoprotegerin is associated with all-cause mortality in CKD stage 4 and 5 
      patients in addition to vascular calcification.
PG  - 3157-62
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
      understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
      importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular 
      calcification (VC), on survival. METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis 
      (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors 
      completed 40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the 
      superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard 
      clinical biochemical analysis. RESULTS: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had 
      died (27 men and 4 women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The 
      majority of deaths were in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD 
      subjects. The outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate 
      logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 
      0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 0.26 
      (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSION: We 
      have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in CKD stages 4 and 5 
      over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, independent of CRP, is 
      also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated; 
      however, it is likely that they are associated with vascular damage through 
      mechanisms in addition to VC.

      Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 616-22
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.08.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores predict coronary heart disease 
      (CHD) risk. Little is known, however, about the distinctive risk among asymptomatic 
      individuals with very high CAC (≥ 1000) compared to high CAC (400-999). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We compared CHD risk factors and event rates between participants with very 
      high CAC (n = 257) and high CAC (n = 420) among adults free of clinical CHD in the 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC was measured at baseline, and 
      participants were followed for a median of 68 months. Very high CAC (≥ 1000), 
      compared to high CAC (400-999), was associated with male gender (OR 3.10, p < 0.001) 
      and older age (OR 1.42 per 10 year increase, p < 0.001). Chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) was associated with very high CAC (OR 1.66, p = 0.009) with a greater 
      prevalence of moderate CKD (GFR 30-59) in the ≥ 1000 group (25% vs. 18%). Those with 
      very high CAC were more likely to develop angina (adjusted HR 1.72 [95% CI 
      1.03-2.90], p = 0.04), but not more likely to experience myocardial infarction, 
      resuscitated cardiac arrest, or CHD death (adjusted HR 1.17, [95% CI 0.64-2.12] p = 
      0.61) compared to high CAC. Total CHD event rates were greater for very high CAC 
      (3.7 per 100 person-years) compared to high CAC (2.6 per 100 person-years). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both high and very high CAC are associated with an elevated risk of CHD 
      events in those without symptomatic CHD at baseline; however, very high CAC is 
      associated with an increased risk of angina, but not CHD death or MI, compared to 
      high CAC.

TI  - Effect of the duration of dialysis on survival in a cohort of chronic haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 782-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in chronic 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients, and usually progress with time. Whether the length of 
      dialysis treatment in chronic HD patients is a significant independent risk factor 
      of death is not clear. METHODS: A cohort of chronic HD patients from the Okinawa 
      Dialysis Study, n=1243 (720 men, 523 women), was followed from January 1991 to 
      December 2000, and their survival rates were compared against the duration of HD, 
      which was calculated in months from the start of dialysis therapy to January 1991. A 
      Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to examine the influence of 
      the duration of dialysis on survival, after adjusting for other factors such as age, 
      sex, serum albumin concentration and diastolic blood pressure. The hazards ratio and 
      95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in both diabetic and non-diabetic 
      patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of dialysis was 61.9 months and ranged from 1 
      to 233 months. The numbers of patients who died, underwent renal transplantation or 
      were transferred outside Okinawa were 568 (45.7%), 61 (4.9%) and 14 (1.1%), 
      respectively, during the study. The hazards ratio (95% CI) was 1.002 (1.000-1.004, 
      P=0.0245) for non-diabetic patients and 1.006 (1.001-1.011, P=0.0214) for diabetic 
      patients, suggesting that the longer the duration of dialysis, the greater the risk 
      of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that prolonged dialysis is a significant 
      predictor of death in chronic HD patients, in particular diabetic patients. Whether 
      this is related to the progression of the atherosclerotic process or to uraemic 
      conditions remains to be shown.

TI  - Coronary plaque composition, morphology, and outcomes in patients with and without 
      chronic kidney disease presenting with acute coronary syndromes.
PG  - S53-61
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2011.12.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      on coronary atherosclerotic plaque composition, morphology, and outcomes in patients 
      with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). BACKGROUND: CKD patients presenting with ACS 
      are at increased risk for adverse events. Whether or not this increased risk 
      reflects differences in coronary plaque composition remains unknown. METHODS: In the 
      PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the 
      Coronary Tree) study, patients presenting with ACS in whom percutaneous coronary 
      intervention was successful underwent 3-vessel grayscale and radiofrequency 
      intravascular ultrasound imaging. Lesions were prospectively characterized, and 
      patients were followed for a median of 3.4 years. We conducted a patient-level and 
      lesion-level analysis of study participants by comparing intravascular ultrasound 
      parameters of untreated nonculprit lesions in patients with and without CKD. 
      RESULTS: Patients with CKD (n = 73, 11.3%) were older, more often female and 
      diabetic compared to those without CKD (n = 573). Nonculprit lesions in patients 
      with (n = 280) versus without (n = 2,390) CKD were more likely to have plaque burden 
      ≥ 70% (11.8% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.05) and minimal luminal area ≤ 4.0 mm(2) (25.9% vs. 
      19.2%, p = 0.005). The percentage of plaque comprised of necrotic core (15.0% vs. 
      13.0%, p = 0.0001) and dense calcium (8.2% vs. 6.4%, p < 0.0001) was higher while 
      fibrous tissue (57.7% vs. 59.8%, p < 0.0001) was lower in CKD versus non-CKD 
      lesions. The 3-year composite rate of cardiac death, cardiac arrest, or myocardial 
      infarction (15.1% vs. 3.3%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher in patients with 
      than in those without CKD, although there were no differences in the rates of events 
      adjudicated to nonculprit lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Following percutaneous coronary 
      intervention of all culprit lesions in ACS, patients with versus without CKD have 
      more extensive and severe atherosclerosis remaining in their coronary tree with 
      plaque composed of greater necrotic core and less fibrous tissue. These influences 
      resulted in nonsignificantly different rates of non-culprit lesion-related adverse 
      events, although cardiac death, arrest, or myocardial infarction were more common in 
      patients with CKD.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and associated factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 395-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and 
      is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular 
      calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, 
      and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in 
      a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the 
      recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative 
      guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a 
      sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level 
      (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' 
      characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 
      and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; 
      and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% 
      and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, 
      and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 
      6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant 
      treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as 
      a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 
      66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 
      21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a 
      higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < 
      .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage 
      levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, 
      normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip 
      bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were 
      significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol 
      deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated 
      factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher 
      intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy 
      of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D 
      supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need 
      for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and 
      the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

TI  - Rapid GFR decline is associated with renal hyperfiltration and impaired GFR in 
      adults with Type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 1706-11
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) is 
      an increasingly recognized high-risk diabetic nephropathy (DN) phenotype in Type 1 
      diabetes. Rapid GFR decline is a recognized predictor of impaired GFR (<60 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2)). However, the association between rapid GFR decline and renal 
      hyperfiltration is not well described in Type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that renal 
      hyperfiltration (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) 
      would predict rapid GFR decline over 6 years and that rapid GFR decline would 
      predict impaired GFR at 6 years in adults with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: GFR was 
      calculated by chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) creatinine in 646 adults 
      with Type 1 diabetes in the coronary artery calcification in Type 1 diabetes study. 
      Logistic multivariable models were employed to investigate the relationships between 
      renal hyperfiltration and rapid GFR decline, and rapid GFR decline and incident 
      impaired GFR over 6 years. RESULTS: Renal hyperfiltration predicted greater odds of 
      rapid GFR decline over 6 years [odds ratio (OR): 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      3.03-8.25, P < 0.0001] adjusting for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), sex, duration, log of 
      albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, rapid GFR 
      decline predicted greater odds of incident impaired eGFR (OR: 15.99, 95% CI 
      2.34-114.37, P = 0.006) in a similarly adjusted model. Sensitivity analyses with GFR 
      calculated by CKD-EPI combined creatinine and cystatin C, and renal hyperfiltration 
      defined as ≥135 mL/min/1.73 m(2) yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In adults 
      with Type 1 diabetes, rapid GFR decline over 6 years was associated with baseline 
      renal hyperfiltration and incident GFR impairment. These observations may suggest an 
      intermediate and predictive role of rapid GFR decline in the progression of DN.

TI  - Incidental renal artery calcifications: a study of 350 consecutive abdominal 
      computed tomography scans.
PG  - 2170-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcifications in arteries are thought to represent atherosclerosis. 
      METHODS: Consecutive abdominal tomographic scans performed during a 4-month period 
      were evaluated and assessed for renal artery calcifications (RAC). Scans that showed 
      calcifications were evaluated for renal artery narrowing and for various 
      characteristics of the atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Of 350 consecutive 
      examinees, 43% were men, 40% had hypertension and 38% had hypercholesterolaemia. The 
      age was 61 +/- 13 years. Aortic calcifications were found in 54% and RAC in 102 
      (29%), of whom 53 had bilateral calcifications. Subjects with RAC were older, 72 +/- 
      6 versus 55 +/- 12 years. Adjusted odds ratios of RAC were 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.6) for 
      male gender, 2.4 (1.2-4.8) for hypertension and 2.9 (1.4-5.8) for 
      hypercholesterolaemia, whereas family history of hypertension was protective with 
      0.5 (0.3-0.9). All patients with calcified renal arteries had aortic calcifications, 
      versus 35% of those without RAC. A significant correlation was found between the 
      severity of calcifications and the degree of renal artery narrowing (r = 0.7), and 
      also between the presence of bilateral calcifications and a high-grade narrowing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RAC strongly relates to atherosclerosis. Calcifications and artery 
      narrowing may have a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Bilateral 
      calcifications suggest atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

TI  - Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study 
      evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.
PG  - 263
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved 
      knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We 
      assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size 
      (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification 
      (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a 
      prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-four 
      dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included 
      in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC 
      score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels 
      (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the 
      multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. 
      RESULTS: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification 
      scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) 
      died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart 
      failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were 
      included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), 
      area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], 
      AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) 
      were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant 
      after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not 
      increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not 
      improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on 
      multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges 
      were based on 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on 
      chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis 
      patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac 
      size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve 
      prognostication in this population.

TI  - Human uraemic serum displays calcific potential in vitro that increases with 
      advancing chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 237-45
LID - 10.1042/CS20120638 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) strongly correlates with declining renal function and 
      contributes to the high morbidity and mortality of patients with CKD (chronic kidney 
      disease). It is closely regulated by circulating factors but little is known about 
      the capacity of serum from patients to induce calcification outside the disease 
      setting, which we now define as the calcific potential of serum. We have therefore 
      examined the ability of serum from age- and sex-matched subjects with and without 
      advancing CKD to induce calcification of cultured SMCs (smooth muscle cells). 
      Samples from patients with CKD induced significant calcification compared with 
      controls. More importantly, samples from patients on haemodialysis induced 
      significantly higher calcification than those with moderate or advanced CKD. The 
      calcification induced by the latter two but not those on haemodialysis could be 
      enhanced with calcium chloride and β-GP (β-glycerophosphate). A positive correlation 
      was evident between measured serum creatinine, phosphate, PTH (parathyroid hormone), 
      OPG (osteoprotegerin) and the degree of calcification in vitro. eGFR (estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), haemoglobin and serum 
      albumin correlated negatively. Stepwise multivariate analysis of log-transformed 
      calcific potential data highlighted serum creatinine, albumin and OPG as significant 
      predictors, explaining approximately 50% of the variation. Thus, other regulators, 
      either not investigated or as yet unidentified, may contribute to the calcification 
      potential of serum in vitro. Furthermore, uraemic serum can induce graded 
      calcification outside of the disease milieu that reflects the degree of kidney 
      impairment in vivo. These findings could have important clinical relevance in terms 
      of developing novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for subjects with CKD.

TI  - The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium concentration 
      among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0139-9 [doi]
LID - 136
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is 
      inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case 
      reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the 
      hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We 
      hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently 
      reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum 
      Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study 
      the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels. METHODS: Using a single-center 
      cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum 
      Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive 
      serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests 
      was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined 
      in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of 
      ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration. RESULTS: 55 % of patients 
      were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a 
      dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 
      0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 
      vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate 
      Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more 
      PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 
      0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time 
      on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067). CONCLUSION: Among HD 
      patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further 
      research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among 
      PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

TI  - Association of serum alkaline phosphatase and bone mineral density in maintenance

PG  - 182-92

AB  - Recent studies indicate that serum alkaline phosphatase (AlkPhos), a surrogate of 
      high turnover bone disease, is associated with coronary artery calcification and 
      death risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The association between 
      AlkPhos and bone mineral density (BMD) is not well studied. We studied the 
      association between AlkPhos and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed BMD in a 
      group of MHD patients in Southern California. In 154 MHD patients, aged 55.3 +/- 
      13.6 years, including 42% women, 38% Hispanics, 42% African Americans, and 55% 
      diabetics, the mean serum AlkPhos was 121 +/- 63 U/L (median: 101, Q(25-75): 
      81-141); 36% had AlkPhos>/=120 U/L and 50% had a total T-score< or =-1. Whereas the 
      total BMD did not correlate with age (r=0.01, P=0.99) or body mass index (r=0.10, 
      P=0.22), it correlated negatively with AlkPhos (r=-0.25, P=0.002), including after 
      multivariate adjustment (r=-0.24, P=0.003). The proportion of patients with a high 
      coronary artery calcification score>400 was incrementally higher across worsening 
      BMD tertiles (P trend=0.04). The BMD was significantly worse in MHD patients with 
      serum AlkPhos> or =120 U/L compared with <120 U/L (1.01 +/- 0.016 vs. 1.08 +/- 0.013 
      g/cm(2), respectively, P<0.001). The multivariate adjusted odds ratio of AlkPhos> or 
      =120 U/L for having a total T-score<-1.0 was 2.3 (1.1-4.8, P=0.037). Among routine 
      clinical and biochemical markers, serum AlkPhos> or =120 U/L was a better predictor 
      of total T-score< or =-1 in MHD patients. An association exists between higher serum 
      AlkPhos and worse dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-assessed BMD in MHD patients. 
      Given these findings, studies are indicated to examine whether interventions that 
      lower serum AlkPhos improve BMD in MHD patients.

TI  - Impact of Lesion Morphology on Durability After Angioplasty of Failed Arteriovenous 
      Fistulas in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 649-654
LID - 10.1177/1526602817748316 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate if morphological patterns of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) 
      venous lesions affect primary patency after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
      (PTA). METHODS: From July 2014 to June 2015, 262 patients underwent PTA for failed 
      AVFs. A total of 104 patients were excluded owing to (1) calcification or AVF 
      occlusion precluding ultrasound examination, (2) central venous or arterial lesions, 
      and (3) no follow-up, leaving 158 patients (mean age 71±12; 96 men) for analysis. 
      More than half of the patients had one or more previous PTAs for the failed AVF. 
      Prior to PTA the stenotic lesions were assessed using ultrasonography to determine 
      stenotic patterns at the minimum lumen area site and to evaluate the flow volume in 
      the brachial artery. Three stenotic patterns were identified: intimal hyperplasia 
      (IH) stenosis (n=110), shrinking lumen stenosis (n=32), and venous valve-related 
      stenosis (n=16). The main outcome measure was primary patency after PTA estimated 
      using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors for loss of primary patency were determined 
      using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model; the results are presented as 
      the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Median 
      follow-up after PTA was 6.3 months (interquartile range 3.3, 10.5). The 6-month 
      primary patency estimates were 56%±5% in the IH group, 40±9% in the shrinking lumen 
      group, and 100% in the valve stenosis group (IH vs shrinking, p=0.013; IH vs valve, 
      p=0.003). In multivariate analysis, shrinking lumen morphology had a negative impact 
      on primary patency (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.36, p=0.005), while venous 
      valve-related stenosis had a positive impact (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79, 
      p=0.023). Flow volume (10-mL/min increments; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, p=0.004) 
      and history of PTA (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.60, p=0.029) were also independently 
      associated with primary patency after PTA. CONCLUSION: The patterns of AVF stenosis 
      as determined by ultrasound can affect the outcome of treatment with balloon 
      dilation.

TI  - Coronary plaque characteristics in patients with mild chronic kidney disease. 
      Analysis by 320-row area detector computed tomography.
PG  - 1436-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The differences in the coronary plaque characteristics between patients 
      with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 
      30-59 ml·min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2)) and those without CKD (eGFR ≥60) by 320-row area 
      detector computed tomography (CT) have not been studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 487 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography with suspected stable 
      coronary artery disease (mean age: 66.6±10.8 years, 131 with mild CKD) and analyzed 
      6,352 segments. All coronary plaques were characterized for the presence of vessel 
      remodeling, plaque consistency and the disposition of coronary calcification, and a 
      plaque with positive vessel remodeling and/or low-attenuation was defined as high 
      risk. The number of diseased segments per patient was higher in mild CKD patients 
      than in those without CKD (4.61±3.83 vs. 2.95±3.11, P<0.0001). The prevalence of 
      severe stenosis (≥70% luminal diameter) was significantly higher in cases of mild 
      CKD than in no CKD (35.1% vs. 19.4%, P=0.0003), but there was no significant 
      difference in the prevalence of high-risk plaque (13.0% vs. 9.8%, P=0.3189). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The severity of coronary artery stenosis was higher in the patients 
      with mild CKD, though there was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
      high-risk plaque. We suggest that the high risk of coronary events in patients with 
      CKD is related to the severity of stenosis rather than to the characteristics of 
      plaque.

TI  - Association of dialysate calcium concentration with fetuin A level and carotid 
      intima-media thickness in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 65-8
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2013.832309 [doi]
AB  - Serum fetuin A has been shown to be associated with the risk of vascular 
      calcification and atherosclerosis, and it can predict the onset of cardiovascular 
      mortality in dialysis patients. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an 
      accessible and reliable method to identify the subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the relationships between dialysate calcium 
      concentrations and fetuin A or cIMT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
      Forty patients, newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing 
      peritoneal dialysis, were enrolled in the study, with a calcium content of the 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution of 1.25 mmol/L in 20 patients (low-Ca group) and 
      1.75 mmol/L in 20 patients (standard-Ca group). The patients were followed up for 12 
      months after the PD conducted. Serum fetuin A was determined using a human fetuin A 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and cIMT was detected using ultrasonic wave. 
      We observed no difference between two groups with regard to the baseline data of 
      fetuin A, cIMT, calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, high sensitivity 
      CRP (hsCRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), or lipid parameters. After 12 months 
      follow-up, fetuin A (263.92 ± 16.1 vs. 282.76 ± 21.0, p = 0.017) and 
      calcium-phosphorus product (39.85 ± 7.76 vs. 47.50 ± 6.65, p = 0.009) were obviously 
      lower in the low-Ca group than standard-Ca group, the other serum parameters were 
      not different between these two groups. Compared with baseline data, serum fetuin A 
      concentration significantly reduced in low-Ca group ( p < 0.05). The number of 
      patients with increased cIMT and newly occurring cardiovascular events in the low-Ca 
      group were significantly reduced than standard-Ca group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, 
      our data suggest that low calcium dialysate treatment is associated with the 
      decreased serum fetuin A concentration and serum calcium-phosphorus product, and it 
      is associated with the reduced number of PD patients with increased cIMT or with 
      newly occurring cardiovascular events. However, more studies with lager sample size 
      should be performed in the future.

TI  - Serum Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase-5b Levels are Associated with the Severity 
      and Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.
PG  - 1058-1068
LID - 10.5551/jat.39339 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are 
      specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated 
      with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the severity 
      of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in 
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on 
      coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 71 CAD 
      patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) and 28 age- and gender- 
      matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker 
      of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the 
      extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were 
      measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were classified into quartiles. 
      RESULTS: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in 
      healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and 
      Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were 
      associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear 
      regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or 
      the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b 
      level. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly 
      associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary 
      atherosclerosis in CAD patients.

TI  - Chondrocyte rather than osteoblast conversion of vascular cells underlies medial 
      calcification in uremic rats.
PG  - 1741-50
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.204834 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate cell biological changes in calcified aortas of rats that 
      experienced chronic renal failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vascular smooth muscle cells 
      have the potential to transdifferentiate to either chondrocytes or osteoblasts, 
      depending on the molecular pathways that are stimulated. Uremia-related medial 
      calcification was induced by feeding rats an adenine low-protein diet for 4 weeks. 
      Aortic calcification was evaluated biochemically and histochemically and with in 
      vivo micro-computed tomographic scanning. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were 
      applied to analyze the time-dependent aortic expression of molecules involved in the 
      segregation between the chondrocyte versus osteoblast differentiation pathway. After 
      4 weeks, 85% of the uremic rats had developed distinct aortic medial calcification, 
      which increased to severely calcified lesions during further follow-up. The 
      calcification process was accompanied by a significant time-dependent increase in 
      the expression of the chondrocyte-specific markers sex determining region Y-box 9 
      (sox9), collagen II, and aggrecan and a nonsignificant trend toward enhanced core 
      binding factor alpha 1 (cbfa1), and collagen I. The expression of the osteoblast 
      marker osterix and both lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 and beta-catenin, 
      molecules of the wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 
      (Wnt)/beta-catenin pathway induced during osteoblast differentiation, was 
      suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: In the aorta of uremic rats, medial smooth muscle cells 
      acquire a chondrocyte rather than osteoblast phenotype during the calcification 
      process.

TI  - Carotid atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure-the central role of increased 
      plaque burden.
PG  - 295-302
AB  - Studies on carotid artery atherosclerosis have been performed in order to understand 
      the high risk for cardiovascular disease in chronic renal failure (CRF). The purpose 
      of this study was to evaluate the extent and nature of carotid artery 
      atherosclerosis in patients with CRF. Of the 135 patients with CRF (52 +/- 11 
      years), 58 had moderate to severe predialysis CRF (PR), 36 were on dialysis 
      treatment (DI), and 41 were renal transplant recipients (TR). In addition, 58 
      control subjects (CO) were examined. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness 
      (IMT), plaque prevalence, plaque score, and stiffness index beta were determined. 
      Furthermore, plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were 
      classified. Plaque prevalence (PR 64%, DI 61%, TR 51%, CO 28%; P < 0.001) and plaque 
      score (PR 3.3 +/- 4.3, DI 3.0 +/- 3.4, TR 2.5 +/- 3.2, CO 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm; P < 0.001) 
      were significantly greater in the CRF patient groups compared to the controls, 
      whereas no difference in IMT was noted between the study groups. The prevalences of 
      plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were higher among the CRF 
      patient groups. In addition, the stiffness index beta was higher in the CRF patient 
      groups. The present study shows that the characteristic alterations of the carotid 
      arteries in CRF include increased plaque burden, calcification and increased 
      arterial stiffness.

TI  - Estimated kidney function based on serum cystatin C and risk of subsequent coronary 
      artery calcium in young and middle-aged adults with preserved kidney function: 
      results from the CARDIA study.
PG  - 410-7
LID - 10.1093/aje/kws581 [doi]
AB  - Whether kidney dysfunction is associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) in young 
      and middle-aged adults who have a cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate (eGFRcys) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is unknown. In the Coronary Artery 
      Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (recruited in 1985 and 1986 in 
      Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, 
      California), we examined 1) the association of eGFRcys at years 10 and 15 and 
      detectable CAC over the subsequent 5 years and 2) the association of change in 
      eGFRcys and subsequent CAC, comparing those with stable eGFRcys to those whose 
      eGFRcys increased (>3% annually over 5 years), declined moderately (3%-5%), or 
      declined rapidly (>5%). Generalized estimating equation Poisson models were used, 
      with adjustment for age, sex, race, educational level, income, family history of 
      coronary artery disease, diabetes, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tobacco use. Among 3,070 
      participants (mean age 35.6 (standard deviation, 4.1) years and mean eGFRcys 106.7 
      (standard deviation, 18.5) mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 529 had detectable CAC. Baseline 
      eGFRcys was not associated with CAC. Moderate eGFRcys decline was associated with a 
      33% greater relative risk of subsequent CAC (95% confidence interval: 5, 68; P = 
      0.02), whereas rapid decline was associated with a 51% higher relative risk (95% 
      confidence interval: 10, 208; P = 0.01) in adjusted models. In conclusion, among 
      young and middle-aged adults with eGFRcys greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), annual 
      decline in eGFRcys is an independent risk factor for subsequent CAC.

TI  - [Prevalence of vertebral fractures and aortic calcifications in hemodialysis 
      patients: comparison with a population of the same age and sex].
PG  - 106-11
AB  - Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence of 
      fractures, principally peripheral fractures. However, there are few studies focusing 
      on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover, aortic calcifications are very 
      common and are an independent predictive factor of vascular morbidity and mortality. 
      The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and 
      vascular calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison with 
      a random sample of general population of similar age and from the same geographical 
      area (n = 624) and study their relationship with clinical, biochemical and 
      therapeutical data. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in HD patients and general 
      population was 19.1% and 24.1% respectively (non-significant statistical 
      differences). In both, sexes, the presence of vertebral fractures was positively 
      associated with age, mean maximum Ca, mean maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was 
      positively associated as well. On the other hand, the prevalence of aortic 
      calcifications was much higher in HD patients (77.9% vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). HD was a 
      risk factor for aortic calcification in women [OR = 7.7 (IC 95% = 2.6-22.9)] as in 
      men [OR = 5 (IC 95% = 1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular calcifications were more frequent 
      in HD patients, it reached 57.4% compared with 17% of general population (p < 
      0.001). Both, in women (64.5% vs 13.3% p < 0.001) and in men (51.4% vs 20.9%), 
      respectively (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was 
      similar in HD patients and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and 
      severity of aortic calcifications was higher in HD patients.

TI  - Potential Correlation Between Circulating Fetuin-A and Pentraxin-3 With Biochemical 
      Parameters of Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 752-755
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular 
      risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been 
      well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 
      3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the 
      correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective 
      upon vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: We included 84 HD patients and 
      84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this 
      study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of 
      creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods. RESULTS: We found that the 
      serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P 
      in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum 
      levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, 
      fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as 
      duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 
      and PTH was significant only in the patient group. CONCLUSION: In this study, 
      increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. 
      According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable 
      markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening syndrome marked by vascular 
      calcification and cutaneous necrosis. The role of radiographic imaging in assisting 
      in diagnosis has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role 
      of plain radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of calciphylaxis. METHODS: We 
      searched for cases of patients at our tertiary referral center with a diagnosis of 
      calciphylaxis between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2010. Two control patients receiving 
      dialysis but without calciphylaxis were age- and sex-matched to each study patient. 
      Plain radiographs were obtained from the date closest to diagnosis in patients with 
      calciphylaxis and from matched controls at approximately the same dates. Two 
      radiologists, masked as to cases and controls, read each image together. Size of 
      calcified vessels, pattern and extent of calcifications, presence of net-like or 
      other calcifications, and bone density/mineralization were recorded and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with calciphylaxis (mean age, 57 years; 21 [72%] 
      women) were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 36-75 years). 
      Compared with those of controls, plain radiographs of patients with calciphylaxis 
      had more vascular calcifications, more small-vessel calcifications, and a netlike 
      pattern of calcifications. A netlike pattern of calcifications had considerable 
      strength of association with calciphylaxis (odds ratio, 9.4) and a specificity of 
      nearly 90%. These findings were preserved even if only one image was used per 
      patient. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study. CONCLUSION: A netlike pattern 
      of calcifications on plain radiographs was more common in patients with 
      calciphylaxis and may aid in diagnosis.

TI  - Serum level of soluble Hsp70 is associated with vascular calcification.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.1007/s12192-010-0237-3 [doi]
AB  - It has been previously reported that serum levels of 70-kDa heat shock protein 
      (Hsp70) are elevated in peripheral artery disease. The aim of the present study was 
      to examine whether increased serum Hsp70 levels are related to the extent of 
      arterial calcification and standard laboratory parameters of patients with 
      peripheral artery disease, as well as to markers of inflammation (C-reactive 
      protein), atherosclerosis (homocysteine), and calcification (fetuin-a). One hundred 
      eighty chronic atherosclerotic patients with significant carotid stenosis and/or 
      lower extremity vascular disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. 
      Systemic atherosclerosis and calcification was assessed by ultrasound (carotid 
      intima-media thickness (IMT), presence of calcification at the abdominal aorta, 
      carotid and femoral bifurcations, and aortic and mitral cardiac valves). Standard 
      serum markers of inflammation, diabetes, renal function, ankle-brachial indexes, and 
      traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted. Serum Hsp70 levels were 
      measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Standard laboratory parameters 
      (clinical chemistry), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine levels were 
      determined by an autoanalyzer using the manufacturer's kits. Fetuin-a levels were 
      measured by radial immunodiffusion. Patients' median age was 64 (57-71) years, 69% 
      were men, and 34.5% had diabetes. Serum heat shock protein 70 levels were 
      significantly higher in patients with more severe arterial calcification (p < 0.02) 
      and showed significant positive correlations with serum bilirubin (r = 0.23, 
      p = 0.002) and homocysteine levels (r = 0.18, p = 0.02). Serum Hsp70 did not 
      correlate with body mass index, IMT, CRP, or fetuin-a levels in this cohort. 
      Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between sHsp70 and 
      calcification score (OR, 2.189; CI, 1.156-4.144, p = 0.016) and this correlation 
      remained significant (OR, 2.264; CI, 1.021-5.020, p = 0.044) after the adjustment 
      for age, sex, eGFR, smoking, CRP, and homocysteine levels. Our data show that serum 
      Hsp70 levels correlate with the severity of atherosclerosis in patients with carotid 
      artery disease and chronic lower limb ischemia. These data support a putative role 
      for plasma Hsp70 in the development of arterial calcification. Nevertheless, further 
      studies are required to investigate the usefulness of circulating Hsp70 level as a 
      marker of atherosclerotic calcification.

TI  - Aortic calcification in haemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 2472-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain metabolic disorders, such as hyperphosphatemia induce vascular 
      calcification in haemodialysis patients; it is unclear, however, whether these 
      disorders contribute to aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients. 
      This study examined the risk factors of aortic calcification in a large number of 
      haemodialysis patients, and compared risk factors between diabetic and non-diabetic 
      patients. METHODS: The subjects were 667 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 184 
      with type 2 diabetes and 483 without. Aortic calcification was measured 
      semi-quantitatively using a plain computed tomography image of the abdominal aorta, 
      and an aortic calcification index (ACI) was calculated. RESULTS: The ACI of the 
      diabetic subjects was significantly higher than that of those without diabetes 
      (57.3+/-22.1 vs 44.8+/-28.3%, P < 0.0001), although the dialysis vintage of the 
      former was significantly shorter (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed 
      that diabetes was a significant independent risk factor for increased ACI. Multiple 
      regression analyses, performed separately in diabetics and non-diabetics, revealed 
      that advanced age, higher systolic blood pressure, smoking and longer haemodialysis 
      vintage were common independent risk factors significantly associated with increased 
      ACI in both patient groups (R2 = 0.296, P < 0.0001 for non-diabetics; R2 = 0.193, P 
      < 0.0001 for diabetics). Higher serum phosphate concentration was not significantly 
      associated with increased ACI in diabetic patients (P = 0.429), although it was a 
      significant independent factor in non-diabetic patients (beta = 0.150, P < 0.0005). 
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients is more 
      advanced, compared with non-diabetic patients, even with short haemodialysis 
      vintage. Since disorders of mineral metabolism are not significantly associated with 
      aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients, aortic calcification in 
      these patients could be affected by metabolic abnormalities associated with the 
      diabetic state per se, independent of other confounding factors; and aortic 
      calcification may be advanced even before haemodialysis induction.

TI  - Relationship between Calcium-Phosphorus Product and Severity of Valvular Heart 
      Insufficiency in Patients Undergoing Chronic Hemodialysis.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent interests have mainly focused on the roles of serum calcium and 
      phosphorus and their product (Ca-P product) in the development of valvular heart 
      disease. The present study assessed the relationship between the Ca-P product and 
      the severity of valvular heart disease in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
      undergoing chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study reviewed the 
      clinical course of 72 consecutive patients with the final diagnosis of ESRD 
      candidated for chronic hemodialysis. The severity of valvular heart disease was 
      determined using M-mode two-dimensional echocardiography. The serum calcium and 
      phosphate values adopted were those values measured on the day between the two 
      consecutive dialyses, and the Ca-P product was calculated. RESULTS: The most common 
      causes of ESRD were diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, and chronic 
      glomerulonephritis. The mean Ca-P product level in the dialysis patients was 50.44 ± 
      17.78 mg(2)/dL(2). The receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve illustrated that 
      a Ca-P product level > 42 mg(2)/dL(2) was the optimal value in terms of sensitivity 
      and specificity for predicting the presence of valvular insufficiency. Aortic 
      insufficiency was directly associated with a high Ca-P product value after 
      adjustment for age, gender, serum albumin, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
      coronary artery disease, and serum creatinine (β = 0.412, SE = 158, p value= 0.011). 
      CONCLUSION: A positive relationship between the Ca-P product value and the severity 
      of aortic insufficiency is expected. Achieving an appropriate control of the Ca-P 
      product level may decrease aortic valve calcification and improve the survival of 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis.

TI  - Correlation between plasma osteopontin levels and aortic valve calcification: 
      potential insights into the pathogenesis of aortic valve calcification and stenosis.
PG  - 196-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.10.045 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The inflammatory process of aortic stenosis involves the differentiation 
      of aortic valve myofibroblasts into osteoblasts. Osteopontin, a proinflammatory 
      glycoprotein, both stimulates differentiation of myofibroblasts and regulates the 
      deposition of calcium by osteoblasts. Osteopontin levels are increased in patients 
      with such conditions as end-stage renal disease, ectopic calcification, and 
      autoimmune disease. We hypothesized that increased plasma osteopontin levels might 
      be associated with the presence of aortic valve calcification and stenosis. METHODS: 
      Venous blood from volunteers older than 65 years undergoing routine 
      echocardiographic analysis or aortic valve surgery for aortic stenosis was 
      collected. Plasma osteopontin levels were measured by means of enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. The presence of aortic stenosis was defined as an aortic valve 
      area of less than 2.0 cm(2). Aortic valve calcification was assessed by using a 
      validated echocardiographic grading system (1, none; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, 
      severe). Comparisons were performed with nonpaired t tests. RESULTS: Aortic stenosis 
      was present in 23 patients (mean age, 78 years) and was absent in 7 patients (mean 
      age, 72 years). Aortic valve calcification scores were 3.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 
      in patients with and without aortic stenosis, respectively (P < .001). Patients with 
      no or mild aortic valve calcification had lower osteopontin levels compared with 
      patients with moderate or severe aortic valve calcification (406.1 +/- 165.8 vs 
      629.5 +/- 227.5 ng/mL, P = .01). Similarly, patients with aortic stenosis had higher 
      osteopontin levels compared with patients without aortic stenosis (652.2 +/- 218.7 
      vs 379.7 +/- 159.9 ng/mL, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Increased levels of plasma 
      osteopontin are associated with the presence of aortic valve calcification and 
      stenosis. These findings suggest that osteopontin might play a functional role in 
      the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis.

TI  - The role of fetuin-A in cardiac functions and metabolism in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 375-82
AB  - AIM: Fetuin-A is a member of protease inhibitors that act as an inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification. In our study, the relationship of fetuin-A with metabolic 
      and echocardiographic parameters in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been 
      investigated. METHODS: Besides demographic, clinical and laboratory data, fetuin-A 
      level was recorded. Echocardiographic examinations were performed by the same 
      operator. RESULTS: Fifty-two chronic PD patients (mean age: 52.7 ± 15.4 years) and 
      31 healthy volunteers (mean age: 41.3 ± 10.7 years) were included. Fetuin-A levels 
      were significantly lower in the patient group (57.5 ± 31.5 ng/mL vs. 72.5 ± 34.0 
      ng/mL, P = 0.002). There was a significant relation between age and fetuin-A levels 
      (P = 0.025). Four patients with chronic heart failure had significantly lower 
      fetuin-A levels compared with those without. There was no relation between fetuin-A 
      levels and the presence of diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy and 
      ischemic heart disease. No relationship was detected between fetuin-A level and any 
      echocardiographic parameter. Age and hematocrite were correlated negatively, and 
      serum albumin positively with fetuin-A levels. On linear regression analysis, 
      fetuin-A level was related with age, hematocrite and presence of heart failure. 
      CONCLUSION: PD patients with heart failure have significantly lower fetuin-A levels. 
      Age is a main determinant of fetuin-A level and fetuin-A may act as a negative acute 
      phase reactant in PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein 
      (MDA-LDL) and MDA-LDL/LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) ratio are risk factors for 
      arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no information is 
      available on these parameters or their associations with coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-seven 
      HD patients and 26 control subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. 
      Serum MDA-LDL concentrations and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios were examined. HD patients had 
      significantly higher MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios than the controls (105.1 ± 27.5 vs. 81.4 ± 
      18.9 mU/mg, P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in serum 
      MDA-LDL levels between the 2 groups. CAC scores were examined only in HD patients 
      and their possible associations with the clinical/laboratory data were analysed. 
      Analysis of HD patients showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio has an association with 
      presence of CVD, CAC score, HD duration, MDA-LDL, or haemoglobin A1C. In addition, 
      the CAC score was positively correlated with serum MDA-LDL level (P = 0.048) and 
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (P = 0.006). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (β = 0.04, P = 0.003) and HD duration (β = 
      0.16, P = 0.007) were independently associated with CAC score. CONCLUSION: The 
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio of HD patients was significantly higher than that of non-HD 
      subjects and was independently associated with the CAC score. Therefore, this ratio 
      could be an important risk factor for CAC in HD patients.

TI  - Active vitamin D and accelerated progression of aortic stiffness in hemodialysis 
      patients: a longitudinal observational study.
PG  - 1346-54
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpu057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that high-dose active vitamin D therapy in the form of 
      alphacalcidol (α-calcidol), used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic 
      kidney disease, could lead to vascular calcification and accelerated progression of 
      aortic stiffness. METHODS: We conducted an observational study in 85 patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis, among which 70 were taking a weekly dose of α-calcidol of <2 
      µg and 15 were taking a weekly dose of ≥2 µg (pharmacological dose). Parathyroid 
      hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23, and α-klotho were 
      determined. Aortic stiffness was assessed by determination of carotid-femoral pulse 
      wave velocity (cf-PWV) at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. A 
      multivariable regression model was used to evaluate the impact of pharmacological 
      dose of α-calcidol on the progression of aortic stiffness. RESULTS: At baseline, 
      clinical, biological, and hemodynamic parameters were similar. At follow-up, cf-PWV 
      increased more in patients with pharmacological dose of α-calcidol (0.583±2.291 m/s 
      vs. 1.948±1.475 m/s; P = 0.04). After adjustment for changes in mean blood pressure 
      and duration of follow-up, pharmacological dose of α-calcidol was associated with a 
      higher rate of progression of cf-PWV (0.969 m/s; 95% confidence interval = 
      0.111-1.827; P = 0.03), and this association persisted after further adjustments for 
      parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, pharmacological dose 
      of α-calcidol was associated with accelerated progression of aortic stiffness. This 
      study suggest that the vascular safety of active vitamin D posology may need to be 
      specifically addressed in the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related bone 
      mineral disorder.

AB  - Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased mortality in 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), but the pathogenesis of this condition 
      is not well understood. We evaluated the relationship of CAC score (CACs) and 
      variability in serum phosphorus in MHD patients. Seventy-seven adults on MHD at 
      Huashan Hospital (Shanghai) were enrolled in July, 2010. CAC of all the patients 
      were measured by computed tomography and CACs was calculated by the Agatston method 
      at the entry of enrollment. Patients were divided into three categories according to 
      their CACs (0∼10, 11∼400, and >400). Blood chemistry was recorded every 3 months 
      from January 2008 to July 2010. Phosphorus variation was defined by the standard 
      deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation (CV) and it was calculated from the past 
      records. The ordinal multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze 
      the predictors of CAC. The mean patient age (± SD) was 61.7 years (±11.3) and 51% of 
      patients were men. The mean CACs was 609.6 (±1062.9), the median CACs was 168.5, and 
      78% of patients had CACs more than 0. Multivariate analysis indicated that female 
      gender (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07-0.55), age (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.32-4.04), serum 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.31-3.85), SD-phosphorus 
      calculated from the most recent 6 measurements (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.23-3.63), and 
      CV-phosphorus calculated from the most recent 6 measurements (OR = 1.90, 95% 
      CI = 1.16-3.11) were significantly and independently associated with CACs. These 
      associations persisted for phosphorus variation calculated from past 7, 8, 9, 10, 
      and 11 follow-up values. Variability of serum phosphorus may contribute 
      significantly to CAC and keeping serum phosphorus stable may decrease coronary 
      calcification and associated morbidity and mortality in MHD patients.

TI  - C-reactive protein is a significant predictor of vascular calcification of both 
      aorta and hand arteries.
PG  - 408-12
AB  - Although evidence has accumulated indicating a close relationship between 
      inflammation and atherosclerosis, the relationship between inflammation and vascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure is unclear. In the present 
      study, the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and vascular calcification 
      in dialysis patients was examined. Vascular calcification of the aorta and hand 
      arteries of 512 hemodialysis patients without significant infection (age 58.8 +/- 
      10.1 y; 305 men, 207 women) were examined by roentgenography of the lateral abdomen 
      and hands, respectively. Patients with a mean CRP level greater than 1.0 mg/L (n = 
      254) were older than those with a CRP level less than or equal to 1.0 mg/L (n = 258) 
      and had a longer duration of dialysis, lower serum albumin level, and higher 
      phosphate level ( P < .01, P < .05, P < .001, and P < .01, respectively). Prevalence 
      of vascular calcification of aorta and hand arteries in the former group was 
      significantly higher than in the latter (65.0% versus 43.8% for aorta, P < .0001; 
      and 25.0% versus 14.7% for hand arteries, P < .01). In a multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis adjusted for age, hemodialysis duration, sex, levels of calcium 
      and phosphate, and presence of diabetes, CRP level was a significant predictor for 
      the presence of aortic calcification (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quartile, 
      2.669; 95% confidence interval, 1.539-5.421, P = .0010) and of calcification of hand 
      arteries (odds ratio, 2.243; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-4.841; P = .0395). In 
      conclusion, the present study shows that increased levels of CRP are significantly 
      associated with the presence of vascular calcification in both aorta and hand 
      arteries (ie, with both atheromatous and medial forms of calcification), indicating 
      evidence for a relationship between inflammation and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Calcimimetic and vitamin D analog use in hemodialyzed patients is associated with 
      increased levels of vitamin K dependent proteins.
PG  - 333-41
LID - 10.1007/s12020-015-0673-z [doi]
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) are two vitamin K-dependent 
      proteins (VKDPs) involved in the regulation of vascular calcification (VC). We 
      carried out a secondary analysis of the VIKI study to evaluate associations between 
      drug consumption and VKDP levels in 387 hemodialyzed patients. The VIKI study 
      assessed the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in hemodialysis patients. We 
      evaluated drug consumption, determined BGP and MGP levels, and verified the presence 
      of any vertebral fractures (VF) and VC by spine radiographs. Total BGP levels were 
      twice as high with calcimimetics versus no calcimimetics (290 vs. 158.5 mcg/L, p < 
      0.0001) and 69 % higher with vitamin D analogs (268 vs. 159 mcg/L, p < 0.0001). 
      Total MGP was 19 % higher with calcimimetics (21.5 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.04) and 54 
      % higher with calcium acetate (27.9 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.003); no difference was 
      found with vitamin D analogs (21.1 vs. 18.3 mcg/L, p = 0.43). Median Total BGP level 
      was 29 % lower in patients with ≥1 VF (151 vs. 213 mcg/L, p = 0.0091) and 36 % lower 
      in patients with VC (164 vs. 262.1 mcg/L, p = 0.0003). In non-survivors, median BGP 
      and MGP were lower, but only for MGP this difference reached the statistical 
      significance (152 vs. 191 mcg/L, p = 0.20 and 15.0 vs. 19.7 mcg/L, p = 0.02, 
      respectively). Pending studies on vitamin K supplementation, calcimimetics, and 
      vitamin D analogs may play a role in preserving vitamin K-dependent protein 
      activity, thus contributing to bone and vascular health in CKD patients.

TI  - Lack of association of Klotho gene variants with valvular and vascular calcification 
      in Caucasians: a candidate gene study of the Framingham Offspring Cohort.
PG  - 3998-4002
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Valvular and vascular calcification are important early aging phenotypes 
      and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Klotho is a 
      gene primarily expressed in the kidney that has an important role in 
      calcium-phosphate homeostasis. The functional KL-VS variant of Klotho has been 
      associated with aging and cardiovascular disease in human studies, but its role in 
      valvular and vascular calcification remains unknown. We performed a candidate gene 
      study in the Framingham Offspring Cohort to evaluate the effect of KL-VS variant of 
      the Klotho gene on valvular calcification. METHODS: We analyzed the Klotho KL-VS 
      genotype (rs9536314) from the Affymetrix 550K genome-wide dataset, distributed by 
      dbGAP, on 1389 cases and 2139 controls from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring 
      Cohort. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. 
      Valvular calcification was defined as presence of calcification on the mitral 
      annulus or the aortic valve as determined by echocardiography. A sensitivity 
      analysis of coronary artery calcification by electron beam computed tomography was 
      performed on 1363 patients. RESULTS: The frequency of the TT versus the TG allele 
      was not different between the cases and the controls (39 versus 41%). The KL-VS 
      variant of Klotho was not associated with valvular or vascular calcification, 
      despite adequate power to detect association (86% for odds ratios ≥1.2). In 
      sensitivity analyses, no association (P > 0.001) between other common variants of 
      Klotho, β-Klotho or fibroblast growth factor-23 and the end points of valvular or 
      vascular calcification was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our adequately powered 
      candidate gene study, we did not observe an association with the functional KL-VS 
      variant of Klotho and presence of valvular or vascular calcification. Future studies 
      aimed at combining cohorts with echocardiographic phenotypes need to be conducted to 
      identify genetic variants associated with valvular calcification.

TI  - Undercarboxylated matrix GLA protein levels are decreased in dialysis patients and 
      related to parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism and aortic augmentation index.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are related to cardiovascular mortality and 
      morbidity in dialysis patients. Limited data exist on the role of calcification 
      inhibitors, such as matrix-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP) in dialysis patients. 
      METHODS: In 120 dialysis patients and 41 age-matched healthy controls, circulating 
      undercarboxylated (uc) MGP levels were measured with a novel ELISA-based competitive 
      assay. The association between ucMGP levels and determinants of bone mineral 
      metabolism, including the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, was studied. Moreover, 
      the relation between ucMGP levels and arterial stiffness was investigated. RESULTS: 
      The ucMGP level was significantly lower in dialysis patients compared to controls 
      (173 +/- 70 vs. 424 +/- 126 nmol/l; p < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex and 
      duration of dialysis an independent negative association between time-averaged 
      phosphate levels [regression coefficient beta with 95% confidence interval = -64 
      (-107 to -21)] and a positive association between serum ucMGP and fetuin-A [131 
      (55-208)] was observed. Duration of dialysis was inversely correlated with ucMGP (r 
      = -0.24, p = 0.007). ucMGP levels were not related to high-sensitivity C-reactive 
      protein or time-averaged calcium levels. After adjustment for age, sex, 
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, height and mean arterial pressure, ucMGP level was 
      negatively associated with the aortic augmentation index [-0.036 (-0.061 to -0.010)] 
      but not with pulse wave velocity or pulse pressure. CONCLUSION: Significantly lower 
      serum ucMGP levels were observed in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls. 
      ucMGP levels were inversely associated with phosphate and positively associated with 
      serum fetuin-A levels. Furthermore, ucMGP levels were inversely associated with the 
      aortic augmentation index. These data suggest that low ucMGP levels may be a marker 
      of active calcification.

TI  - Cardiac calcifications: Fetuin-A and other risk factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - Cardiac calcifications are a frequent finding in hemodialysis for chronic renal 
      failure. Several factors may play a role in the intimal and medial calcification of 
      coronary arteries such as age and some known atherogenetic factors. In addition, 
      Fetuin-A has been proposed as a protective agent through solubilization of calcium 
      phosphate salt. Fetuin-A is also a marker of inflammatory-nutritional state, and its 
      changes could be an expression of this condition. The aim of this cross-sectional 
      study is to evaluate the relative importance of risk factors of calcifications with 
      special regard to Fetuin-A. The study was conducted with 132 hemodialysis patients. 
      They were subjected to multislice computed tomography for evaluation of calcium 
      deposits in the heart. In addition, the patients were sampled for evaluation of 
      calcium-phosphate parameters, lipid profile, nutritional and inflammatory markers, 
      and also Fetuin-A. There was a wide variability of the extent of calcium deposits 
      expressed as Agatston score, with only 9.3% of patients without calcifications. Age, 
      hemodialysis age, sex, calcium-phosphate parameters, and lipid profile were 
      important risk factors, together with nutritional and inflammatory status of the 
      patients. An inverse correlation between coronary calcium score and Fetuin-A emerged 
      from a multiple regression analysis. However, there was no significant difference in 
      serum Fetuin-A among different grades of calcium score. By dividing the patients in 
      tertiles of serum Fetuin-A, an association between low levels of Fetuin-A and high 
      calcification score was found. Fetuin-A as dependent variable was strictly linked to 
      prealbumin serum levels. In addition, there was a clear link between cardiac 
      calcification scores and inflammatory-nutritional markers. Serum calcium and 
      treatment with calcitriol emerged as predictive variables of coronary score.Fetuin-A 
      could be involved in the process of calcification both in the case of markedly low 
      serum levels, due to decreased prevention of calcium phosphate precipitation, and 
      also as a marker of inflammation, a well-known risk factor of atherogenesis. 
      Treatment with intravenous calcitriol could marginally enhance cardiac 
      calcifications, probably through its hypercalcemic effect.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification in haemodialysis patients: role of calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.
PG  - 2037-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
      frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
      potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD 
      patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control 
      subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was 
      determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of 
      haemodialysis. RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients 
      than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% 
      vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older 
      than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, 
      had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
      highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and 
      the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also found a 
      positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was 
      found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple 
      stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters 
      for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more 
      frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and 
      with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age 
      (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and 
      calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support 
      careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage 
      renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

TI  - Survival following parathyroidectomy among United States dialysis patients.
PG  - 2010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among persons 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone disease, 
      vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can 
      dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the 
      relationship between PTX and survival is not known. METHODS: We conducted an 
      observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United States Renal 
      Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first PTX while on 
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, 
      cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis 
      modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed 
      from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The 30-day 
      postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. Long-term relative risks of 
      death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those 
      of matched control patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 
      groups crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 
      51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, 
      mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to 
      attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients with 
      end-stage renal disease.

TI  - The impact of antihypertensive drug therapy on endotoxemia in elderly patients with 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2389-94
LID - 10.2215/CJN.11211210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endotoxin (ET) is recognized to cause adverse effects on 
      cardiovascular (CV) structure. Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET is 
      described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people 
      and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore studied ET 
      after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of optimized 
      antihypertensive therapy (AHT). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We 
      recruited 40 hypertensive nondiabetic patients (≥70 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 
      and hypertensive non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was performed after complete 
      AHT washout and repeated after AHT reintroduction to target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by applanation tonometry, central 
      hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave analysis, vascular calcification (VC) 
      by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay. RESULTS: 
      Mean age was 76 ± 5 years, estimated GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 ± 14 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was 128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 ± 0.011 EU/ml and 
      was independent of renal function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial stiffness, and 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased with AHT (to 0.020 ± 
      0.028 EU/ml; P < 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = -0.38; P = 0.02), arterial 
      wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 0.01), and degree of tonic 
      vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = -0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC, PWV, 
      gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly 
      patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. Improvement of their CV status 
      with optimized AHT is associated with a significant reduction in endotoxemia. 
      Further investigation of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking CV 
      disease and CKD with this previously unappreciated effect of AHT appears warranted.

TI  - Determinants of coronary artery calcification in diabetics with and without 
      nephropathy.
PG  - 2022-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the general population, including those with diabetes mellitus, 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) correlates with atherosclerotic plaque burden. 
      On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that disordered mineral metabolism 
      significantly contributes to the vascular calcification in individuals with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: In order to determine the relative 
      contribution of accelerated atherosclerosis and disordered mineral metabolism to CAC 
      in chronic kidney disease, a pilot study of 90 patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus was done [age, 40-65 years; normoalbuminuria, N= 30; diabetic nephropathy 
      (DN), N= 60]. RESULTS: CAC was more prevalent and severe among individuals with DN 
      compared to diabetic controls (odds ratio for prevalence 8.1, 95% CI 2.3-28.5; 
      median scores, 66 vs. 4, P < 0.001). None of the 4 measures of disordered mineral 
      metabolism evaluated in this study (serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 
      and 1,25 di-hydroxy vitamin D levels) correlated with the prevalence or severity of 
      CAC, or accounted for the differences seen between DN and diabetic controls. On the 
      other hand, the difference in the severity of hypertension (number of 
      antihypertensive medications) appeared to account for the differences in CAC burden 
      seen between DN and diabetic controls. CONCLUSION: This first such study of 
      nondialyzed individuals with DN suggests that, unlike ESRD patients, the high CAC 
      burden seen at earlier stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease is probably 
      unrelated to disordered mineral metabolism. The relationship between the severity of 
      hypertension and CAC burden provides a probable target for intervention in the 
      predialysis phase of DN.

TI  - Low fetuin-A levels are associated with cardiovascular death: Impact of variations 
      in the gene encoding fetuin.
PG  - 2383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
      observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory 
      glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation 
      and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association 
      between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin 
      gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome. METHODS: In a cohort 
      of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement therapy [glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years the following 
      parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), 
      comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], 
      carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid 
      positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser (C-->G), Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys 
      (C-->T). RESULTS: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) 
      mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking, 
      diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 
      0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had 
      significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD 
      patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N= 101), fetuin-A was 
      significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques 
      independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and inflammation. 
      Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both S-albumin (Rho = 
      0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser 
      allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortality rate if they were inflamed. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that a low 
      fetuin-A level is associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis 
      (carotid plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
      Because the present study demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on 
      both circulating fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with 
      the AHSG 256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.

PG  - 458-67
LID - 10.3969/j.issn.1672-7347.2013.05.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), 
      tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the 
      atherosclerosis progress in the maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 19 patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and 11 healthy people as 
      control. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their age above or below 
      40 years old (11 and 8 in each, respectively), whereas the subjects in control group 
      were below 40 years old. All the clinical information of the research subjects was 
      collected: including age, gender, time of hemodialysis, blood pressure, blood urea 
      nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr). Immunohistochemistry and pathological 
      image analysis were used to investigate the pathological changes, calcification and 
      the expression of PAI-1, t-PA, and ET-1 on the blood vessel. RESULTS: Compared with 
      the age-matched healthy control group, there were higher blood vascular media 
      thickness, blood vascular media thickness/diagmeter ratio, blood vascular media 
      thickness area/vascular inter-wall area ratio (P<0.05) and more calcification 
      (P<0.05) in the the internal iliac artery in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. 
      All the results were similar when compared the above 40 years old group with the 
      below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. There were 
      positive correlation of blood vascular media thickness with age and blood pressure 
      (P<0.05). Expression of PAI-1, ET-1, t-PA on the internal iliac artery vessel was 
      elevated in the chronic renal failure MHD patients compared with the health control 
      (P<0.05). The level of PAI-1 or ET-1 was much higher in the above 40 years old group 
      than the below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas 
      there was no significant difference in the t-PA expression between the 2 groups 
      (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression with age and 
      blood pressure (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression 
      with blood vascular media thickness and calcification (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was 
      no correlation of hemodialysis time with blood vascular media thickness, 
      calcification, PAI-1, t-PA, or ET-1 expressions. CONCLUSION: MHD patients accompany 
      with atherosclerosis which is severer in the patients above 40 years old than the 
      patients below 40 years old. The higher of the blood pressure, the severer of the 
      atherosclerosis. Abnormal expression of PAI-1 plays an important role in the 
      progress of the atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas 
      t-PA has no function in this process. The level of PAI-1 and ET-1 would be helpful 
      to evaluating the degree of atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD 
      patients. Hemodialysis time may not be a potential accelerator for atherosclerosis 
      progression.

TI  - Effect of simvastatin in apolipoprotein E deficient mice with surgically induced 
      chronic renal failure.
PG  - 1631-6
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2007.11.042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with a surgically reduced renal mass are at increased risk for 
      progressive renal failure, which often requires renal replacement therapy or kidney 
      transplantation. We investigated the effects of simvastatin supplementation on 
      uremia enhanced atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in apoE(-/-) 
      (apolipoprotein E deficient) mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, 
      Massachusetts) with or without superimposed chronic kidney disease. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups, including 2 groups with normal 
      renal function (simvastatin vs control in 13 mice) and the other 2 with surgically 
      created chronic kidney disease (simvastatin vs control in 18). Simvastatin (100 
      mg/kg) was administered by daily oral gavage for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Simvastatin 
      treatment did not prevent uremia accelerated atherosclerosis in chronic kidney 
      disease apoE(-/-) mice, nor did it retard atherosclerosis progression in control 
      nonchronic kidney disease mice. However, aortic plaques in simvastatin treated 
      chronic kidney disease mice showed significantly less calcification than those in 
      controls with chronic kidney disease (p <0.03). In addition, the increase of aortic 
      nitrotyrosine staining in mice with chronic kidney disease was prevented by 
      simvastatin treatment (p <0.02). Serum total cholesterol was increased to a similar 
      extent in the 2 chronic kidney disease groups compared with that in the nonchronic 
      kidney disease groups. The beneficial effect of simvastatin on uremia enhanced 
      vascular calcification in apoE(-/-) mice with chronic kidney disease was observed 
      despite the absence of changes in uremia accelerated atherosclerosis progression, 
      serum total cholesterol levels or osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our observation opens the possibility of a cholesterol independent 
      action of statins on vascular calcification via a decrease in oxidative stress.

TI  - Impact of calcification on the long-term outcomes of sirolimus-eluting stent 
      implantation: subanalysis of the Cypher Post-Marketing Surveillance Registry.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term outcome of 
      sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in lesions with severe calcification that 
      may disturb adequate stent expansion and increase the risk of restenosis and target 
      lesion revascularization (TLR). METHODS AND RESULTS: The Cypher Post-Marketing 
      Surveillance Registry study has been conducted since August 2004 in Japan to 
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SES in a real-world setting. Data on 2,458 
      lesions in 2,050 patients were reviewed, and the angiographical outcomes at 240 days 
      and clinical outcomes at 1,080 days after implantation compared between calcified 
      lesions and non-calcified lesions in dialysis patients and non-dialysis patients. In 
      non-dialysis patients, the rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; 16.0% vs. 
      12.8%; P=0.144) including TLR (4.9% vs. 6.0%; P=0.457), and restenosis (10.1% vs. 
      7.8%; P=0.207) were similar in calcified lesions and non-calcified lesions. In 
      dialysis patients, the rate of MACE was similar in calcified lesions and 
      non-calcified lesions (51.1% vs. 43.1%; P=0.544), but the rates of TLR (29.8% vs. 
      9.8%; P=0.020), and restenosis (39.5% vs. 17.0%; P=0.029) were significantly higher 
      in calcified lesions than in non-calcified lesions. CONCLUSIONS: There is a 
      differential impact of calcification on the long-term outcome of SES implantation in 
      dialysis and non-dialysis patients.

TI  - Patency and limb salvage rates after distal revascularization to unclampable 
      calcified outflow arteries.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe circumferential calcification of the outflow artery during 
      lower-extremity distal revascularization is considered a poor prognostic factor for 
      bypass graft patency. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 
      circumferential infrapopliteal arterial calcification on bypass graft patency and 
      limb salvage rates, comparing patency and limb salvage rates in unclampable 
      calcified distal outflow arteries with those observed in uncalcified distal outflow 
      arteries. METHODS: From July 1990 to July 1997, of 441 distal bypass graft 
      procedures performed by the same surgeon, 69 (16%, group I) involved unclampable 
      calcified outflow vessels, whereas 83 (19%, group II) outflow vessels were 
      uncalcified; the other 289 (65%) had varying intermediate degrees of calcification 
      and were not included in this analysis. All procedures were performed for 
      limb-threatening ischemia and involved standard vein patch angioplasty of the distal 
      anastomotic site, irrespective of the conduit used. Primary and secondary patency, 
      limb salvage, and survival rates were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. 
      RESULTS: Groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and atherosclerotic risk 
      factors except for a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (88% vs 65%, P =.001) and 
      renal failure (17% vs 5%, P =.01), including dialysis dependency (P =.01) in group 
      I. Gangrene as an indication for surgery was statistically more frequent in group I 
      (49% vs 29%, P =.01). The distal anastomotic locations and types of conduit involved 
      were similar in the two groups. The femoral inflow level was used more often in 
      group II (63% vs 38%, P =.003), the popliteal in group I (32% vs 17%, P =.03). 
      Follow-up ranged from 30 days to 144 months, with a mean of 69 months. None of the 
      patients were lost during the follow-up period. None of the patients died during the 
      perioperative (30-day) period. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84%, 
      65%, and 52% for group I and 89%, 76%, and 69% for group II (P =.07.). Secondary 
      patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96%, 82%, and 78% for group I and 96%, 85%, 
      and 82% for group II (P =.58). Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93%, 
      83%, and 81% for group I and 97%, 90%, and 86% for group II (P =.39). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Distal revascularization to unclampable, severely calcified outflow arteries can 
      achieve much the same results to those obtained in uncalcified outflow arteries. A 
      circumferentially calcified distal recipient artery should not be considered a major 
      obstacle to an attempt at limb salvage bypass graft surgery.

TI  - Doppler echocardiograph evaluation of pulmonary hypertension in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 356-9
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been reported in hemodialysis (HD) patients, but 
      data regarding its incidence and mechanisms are scarce. The aims of this study was 
      to evaluate the prevalence of unexplained PH in long-term HD patients, and to 
      examine some possible etiologic factors for its occurrence. The prevalence of PH was 
      estimated by Doppler echocardiography in a cohort of 86 stable patients on HD via 
      arteriovenous access for more than 12 months. All the patients underwent full 
      clinical evaluation, chest radiography, and a standard 12-lead echocardiograph. 
      Laboratory investigation included a mean of 12 months (serum calcium, phosphorus, 
      parathormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, lipids, and hemoglobin). Pulmonary 
      hypertension was defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure >35 mmHg as 
      determined by Doppler echocardiography using the modified Bernoulli equation. 
      Pulmonary hypertension was detected in 23 patients (26.74%). Of those with PH, left 
      ventricular hypertrophy was seen in 13 patients (56.52%), and valvular 
      calcifications in 6 patients (26.08%). There were no significant differences between 
      both groups with regard to age, sex, duration of dialysis, shunt location, and all 
      the biological parameters of the study. The presence of PH was not related to the 
      level of PTH, or the severity of other metabolic abnormalities. This study 
      demonstrates a high prevalence of PH among patients with ESRD receiving long-term HD 
      via surgical arteriovenous access. The role of the vascular access, anemia, or 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism as the etiology of PH in HD patients did not hold in 
      this study.

TI  - CT coronary angiography is feasible for the assessment of coronary artery disease in 
      chronic dialysis patients, despite high average calcium scores.
PG  - e67936
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067936 [doi]
LID - e67936
AB  - PURPOSE: Significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in 
      asymptomatic dialysis patients. Identifying these high risk patients is warranted 
      and may improve the prognosis of this vulnerable patient group. Routine 
      catheterization of incident dialysis patients has been proposed, but is considered 
      too invasive. CT-angiography may therefore be more appropriate. However, extensive 
      coronary calcification, often present in this patient group, might hamper adequate 
      lumen evaluation. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of 
      CT-angiography in this patient group. METHODS: For this analysis all patients 
      currently participating in the ICD2 trial (ISRCTN20479861), with no history of PCI 
      or CABG were included. The major epicardial vessels were evaluated on a segment 
      basis (segment 1-3, 5-8, 11 and 13) by a team consisting of an interventional and an 
      imaging specialist. Segments were scored as not significant, significant and not 
      interpretable. RESULTS: A total of 70 dialysis patients, with a mean age of 66±8 yrs 
      and predominantly male (70%) were included. The median calcium score was 623 [79, 
      1619]. Over 90% of the analyzed segments were considered interpretable. The 
      incidence of significant CAD on CT was 43% and was associated with cardiovascular 
      events during follow-up. The incidence of cardiovascular events after 2-years 
      follow-up: 36% vs. 0% in patients with no significant CAD (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: 
      Despite the high calcium scores CT-angiography is feasible for the evaluation of the 
      extent of CAD in dialysis patients. Moreover the presence of significant CAD on CT 
      was associated with events during follow-up.

TI  - The prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 617-23
LID - 10.7150/ijms.5773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prognostic value of the aortic calcification 
      index (ACI), an estimate of abdominal aortic calcification by plain abdominal 
      computed tomography (CT), in terms of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, 
      mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. METHOD: PD patients who received both abdominal CT and echocardiography 
      were divided into a low-ACI group (n=46) and a high-ACI group (n=46). RESULTS: 
      During follow-up (median, 35.2 months; range, 3.6-111.3), 30 patients (32.6%) died 
      and 10 patients (10.9%) developed nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events. The 5-year 
      event-free survival rates for mortality and nonfatal CV events were significantly 
      lower in the high-ACI group compared with those in the low-ACI group (35.7% vs. 
      64.1%, P = 0.01). The ACI was positively correlated with left atrial diameter and 
      ratio of peak early transmitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular 
      velocity (E/E' ratio; a marker of left ventricular diastolic function). Using 
      multivariate analyses, the high-ACI group (vs. low-ACI group, HR 5.25, 95% CI 
      1.77-15.58, P = 0.003) and increased E/E' ratio (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31, P = 
      0.013) were independent predictors for mortality and CV events. The ACI provided a 
      higher predictive value for adverse outcomes (AUC = 0.755, P = 0.002) than the E/E' 
      ratio (AUC = 0.543, P = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The ACI was significantly associated with 
      left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and predicted all-cause mortality and 
      nonfatal CV events in PD patients.

TI  - The relationship between the Spine Deformity Index, biochemical parameters of bone 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications: results from the Epidemiological VERtebral 
      FRACtures iTalian Study (EVERFRACT) in dialysis patients.
PG  - 1595-603
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2014-0194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures 
      (VFs), providing information on both their number and severity. METHODS: We 
      evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical and arterial 
      calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, assessed by 
      quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were identified in 
      the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of fracture severity, we 
      created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the number of VFs. We assessed 
      routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), undercaboxylated BGP (ucBGP), and 
      matrix-Gla-protein (MGP). RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD patients with a SDI 
      >1 were more frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP (p<0.01). Patients with a 
      c-SDI >1 had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP 
      (p<0.05). Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC) were more frequent in 
      patients with SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic 
      regression showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91), age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) 
      and albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 
      1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI 1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, CI 
      0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity 
      of VFs was associated with age, atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

AB  - To analyze predictive factors for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) 
      mortality, nonfatal CV events (CVE) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and 
      to compare the effects of standard hemodialysis (HD) and online hemodiafiltration 
      (HDF) on these factors and outcomes. A total of 333 MHD patients were prospectively 
      followed up for 50 ± 15 months and all-cause death, CV death and CVE were 
      registered. At the baseline, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the whole 
      population were recorded. Then, patients were stratified into two groups according 
      to the dialysis modalities, HD (n = 268) and HDF (n = 65). At the end of 6th month, 
      clinical and laboratory data were recorded again. The predictive factors at baseline 
      for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE were analyzed by Cox regression. The 
      effects of HD and HDF on these factors at the 6th month and long-term outcomes were 
      compared by t-test and Kaplan-Meier method, respectively. Age, gender, left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI), aortic arch calcification score (AoACS), hemoglobin 
      (Hb) <10 g/dL, and ferritin >500 ng/mL maintained independent associations with 
      all-cause mortality. C-reactive protein (CRP), LVMI, AoACS, and Hb <10 g/dL were 
      associated with CV mortality. Prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), AoACS and LVMI 
      were independent predictors of nonfatal CVE. Higher body mass index (BMI), body 
      weight, total serum cholesterol, Hb concentration, and lower CRP level, LVMI, and 
      AoACS were found in patients on HDF at the end of the 6th month. Improved outcomes 
      with longer survival time for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE were found 
      in HDF group. Age, gender, LVMI, AoACS, Hb, and ferritin were predictors of 
      all-cause mortality in MHD patients. CRP, LVMI, AoACS, and Hb were associated with 
      CV mortality. Prior CVD, AoACS, and LVMI were independent predictors of nonfatal 
      CVE. HDF could improve BMI, body weight, total serum cholesterol, Hb, CRP, LVMI, 
      AoACS, and long-term outcomes, including all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE.

TI  - Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla protein concentration is predictive of 
      vitamin K status and is correlated with vascular calcification in a cohort of 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 145

AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is known to act as a potent local inhibitor of 
      vascular calcifications. However, in order to be active, MGP must be phosphorylated 
      and carboxylated, with this last process being dependent on vitamin K. The present 
      study focused on the inactive form of MGP (dephosphorylated and uncarboxylated: 
      dp-ucMGP) in a population of hemodialyzed (HD) patients. Results found in subjects 
      being treated or not with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) were compared and the 
      relationship between dp-ucMGP levels and the vascular calcification score were 
      assessed. METHODS: One hundred sixty prevalent HD patients were enrolled into this 
      observational cohort study, including 23 who were receiving VKA treatment. The 
      calcification score was determined (using the Kauppila method) and dp-ucMGP levels 
      were measured using the automated iSYS method. RESULTS: dp-ucMGP levels were much 
      higher in patients being treated with VKA and little overlap was found with those 
      not being treated (5604 [3758; 7836] vs. 1939 [1419; 2841] pmol/L, p < 0.0001). In 
      multivariate analysis, treatment with VKA was the most important variable explaining 
      variation in dp-ucMGP levels even when adjusting for all other significant 
      variables. In the 137 untreated patients, dp-ucMGP levels were significantly (p < 
      0.05) associated both in the uni- and multivariate analysis with age, body mass 
      index, plasma levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, and FGF-23, and the vascular 
      calcification score. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the concentration of dp-ucMGP was 
      higher in HD patients being treated with VKA. We observed a significant correlation 
      between dp-ucMGP concentration and the calcification score. Our data support the 
      theoretical role of MGP in the development of vascular calcifications. We confirmed 
      the potential role of the inactive form of MGP in assessing the vitamin K status of 
      the HD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: B707201215885.

TI  - The effects of sevelamer and calcium acetate on proxies of atherosclerotic and 
      arteriosclerotic vascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently determined that in hemodialysis patients, the use of calcium 
      salts to correct hyperphosphatemia led to progressive coronary artery and aortic 
      calcification as determined by sequential electron beam tomography (EBT) while the 
      use of the non-calcium-containing binder sevelamer did not. Whether the specific 
      calcium preparation (acetate vs. carbonate) might influence the likelihood of 
      progressive calcification was debated. METHODS: To determine whether treatment with 
      calcium acetate was specifically associated with hypercalcemia and progressive 
      vascular calcification, we conducted an analysis restricted to 108 hemodialysis 
      patients randomized to calcium acetate or sevelamer and followed for one year. 
      RESULTS: The reduction in serum phosphorus was roughly equivalent with both agents 
      (calcium acetate -2.5 +/- 1.8 mg/dl vs. sevelamer -2.8 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.53). 
      Subjects given calcium acetate were more likely to develop hypercalcemia (defined as 
      an albumin-corrected serum calcium > or =10.5 mg/dl) (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.015). 
      Treatment with calcium acetate (mean 4.6 +/- 2.1 g/day - equivalent to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g 
      of elemental calcium) led to a significant increase in EBT-determined calcification 
      of the coronary arteries (mean change 182 +/- 350, median change +20, p = 0.002) and 
      aorta (mean change 181 +/- 855, median change +73, p < 0.0001). These changes were 
      similar in magnitude to those seen with calcium carbonate. There were no significant 
      changes in calcification among sevelamer-treated subjects. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      purported differences in safety and efficacy relative to calcium carbonate, calcium 
      acetate led to hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Biopsy is contraindicated in the management of penile calciphylaxis.
PG  - 2611-7
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12390 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis, a rare obliterative small vessel vasculopathy 
      associated with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), portends a 
      poor prognosis. Because penile involvement is rare, agreement on appropriate 
      diagnosis and management is unclear. AIM: To determine the role and effect of penile 
      biopsy for diagnosis and management of penile calciphylaxis. METHODS: Medical 
      records of three penile calciphylaxis patients from our institution were evaluated. 
      Data collected included age, history of DM, ESRD, and hemodialysis (HD) status, 
      serum calcium (Ca), Ca × phosphorous product (C × P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
      performance of biopsy, presence of non-penile cutaneous lesions, intervention, 
      survival, and time from diagnosis to death. PubMed Search for relevant publications 
      from 1995 to 2012 was performed to identify case reports of penile calciphylaxis 
      that provided the same clinical data obtained from the 3 patients from our 
      institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical evidence for outcomes in patients with 
      penile calciphylaxis after biopsy of penile lesion compared to those without biopsy. 
      RESULTS: A total of sixteen patients were identified in the literature and in our 
      institution with clinical data of interest. Overall, 10/16 (62.5%) patients 
      identified with penile calciphylaxis had a penile biopsy, and 7/10 (70%) experienced 
      disease progression, while only 3/10 (30%) stabilized. Mean time to death in this 
      patient population was short, approximately 6.5 months, regardless of type of 
      intervention. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of our study, we argue that 
      conservative measures should be employed as first line therapy for penile 
      calciphylaxis. More importantly, secondary to likely resultant progression of 
      necrosis, penile biopsy is not only unnecessary for diagnosis of penile 
      calciphylaxis, but is also harmful and contraindicated.

TI  - A cut-off value of plasma osteoprotegerin level may predict the presence of coronary 
      artery calcifications in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 3389-97
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of 
      vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular calcifications 
      are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key role in 
      bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular 
      calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors and 
      OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate cut-off value to 
      predict CAC. METHODS: A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of 
      kidney disease [75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)] were enrolled, 
      excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest multidetector 
      computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected for measurement of 
      vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation, nutrition, calcium phosphate 
      and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and these biological markers was 
      investigated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed 
      thereafter to identify a cut-off value of involved markers that best predicted the 
      presence of CAC. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, 
      among biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using 
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high FEPO(4) [OR = 
      3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high OPG levels [OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11)] were associated with 
      the presence of CAC. A protective effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D [OR = 0.20 
      (0.05-0.79)] and LDL cholesterol [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also observed. 
      ROC curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was 757.7 
      pg/mL. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated 
      with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pg/mL allow us 
      to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.

TI  - Clinical outcome following second-generation drug-eluting stent use for off-label 
      versus on-label indications: insights from the two-year outcome of the TWENTE trial.

AB  - Drug-eluting stents (DES) were first used on-label - in simple patients with low 
      clinical risk and easily accessible lesions. Currently, DES are increasingly used 
      off-label - in complex patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) 
      with historically higher event risk. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether 
      patients with off-label indications for DES use had similar outcomes compared to 
      patients who were treated for on-label indications only. We analysed two-year 
      follow-up data of 1,387 TWENTE trial patients, treated with second-generation 
      everolimus-eluting XIENCE V or zotarolimus-eluting Resolute stents, and compared 
      off-label vs. on-label DES use with regard to the following clinical endpoints: 
      cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), periprocedural MI (≤48 hrs), and target 
      vessel revascularisation (TVR). Patients with off-label DES use (n=1,033; 74.5%) had 
      more diabetes (22.9% vs. 17.5%; p=0.032), previous MI (35.9% vs. 22.3%; p<0.001), 
      type B2/C lesions (84.7% vs. 62.7%; p<0.001), and acute coronary syndromes (57.8% 
      vs. 33.3%; p<0.001). Nevertheless, cardiac death and TVR rates were similar to those 
      of patients with on-label DES use (p>0.8). Following off-label DES use, there was a 
      higher incidence of PMI (5.0% vs. 1.4%; p=0.003), of which only 1.1% reached 
      creatine kinase levels >5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Despite differences in 
      risk profile, patients with off-label DES use did not differ from patients with 
      on-label DES use in clinical endpoints other than periprocedural MI. These largely 
      positive findings underline the favourable safety profile of second-generation DES.

TI  - Association of calcium channel blockers and mortality in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 511-5
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease show disturbances of calcium metabolism, 
      including calcification of arterial walls. Such patients show increased mortality, 
      in particular due to increased cardiovascular-associated deaths. The association of 
      calcium channel blockers and mortality in patients undergoing haemodialysis was 
      investigated. A total of 188 patients who were receiving haemodialysis as of July 
      1998 were followed up for 30 months. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, 
      laboratory and clinical data, medication and dialysis prescription, were obtained. 
      As of December 2000, 51 of the patients (27%) had died. In the deceased group, age 
      was significantly higher, body mass index was significantly lower, and smoking was 
      significantly more frequent compared with the survival group (each P <0.001). The 
      percentage of patients taking calcium channel blockers was significantly higher in 
      the survival group. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that 
      haemodialysis patients assigned calcium channel blocker therapy had a significantly 
      lower risk of mortality [relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67); P 
      <0.001]. Thus, in haemodialysis patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular 
      events, administration of calcium channel blockers was associated with lower 
      mortality.

TI  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients show high prevalence of carotid 
      artery calcification which is associated with a higher left ventricular mass index.
PG  - 848-52
AB  - This study examined intima-media thickness and arterial plaque occurrence in the 
      carotid and brachial arteries in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) 
      patients. The study compared 25 CAPD patients with 25 normotensive age- and 
      sex-matched controls. Intima-media thickness and presence of plaque in carotid and 
      brachial artery were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode 
      echocardiography. Left ventricular mass was calculated using the Penn Convection 
      equation. Blood samples were obtained to assess levels of phosphorus, total calcium, 
      serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and lipid profiles. Compared to the control 
      group, CAPD patients had greater mean carotid and brachial intima-media thickness, 
      and a higher proportion of subjects with calcified plaques. The left ventricular 
      mass index was higher in CAPD patients with carotid artery calcified plaques 
      compared to CAPD patients without carotid artery calcified plaques. CAPD patients 
      with such plaque were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus, higher 
      C-reactive protein levels and a lower 2-yr survival rate. The present study showed 
      an high prevalence of carotid calcification in CAPD patients and those with such 
      calcification had a greater incidence of diabetes mellitus, higher C-reactive 
      protein levels and left ventricular mass index, and a lower survival rate.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease and other complications of atherosclerosis are 
      the most common cause of death in patients with chronic renal failure in maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD). Carotid ultrasonography is a simple non-invasive tool to 
      investigate the vascular system, by means of intima media thickness (IMT) 
      measurement and carotid wall calcifications. OBJECTIVE: To determine IMT and the 
      presence of plaques, and their possible clinical relationships; finally we tried to 
      investigate whether they would predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 
      patients in MHD. METHODS: We studied 60 MHD patients (age 68 +/- 13 years, 48% male, 
      50% diabetics, time on MHD 32 +/- 11 months) and a control group of 274 people 
      matched for age and sex. Follow-up period was 66 +/- 13 months. MEASUREMENTS: 
      Demographic and clinical data, serum levels of homocysteine (tHcy), folic acid (FA) 
      and B6 and B12 vitamins. IMT was measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. 
      RESULTS: IMT was higher in MHD patients than in those in the control group (0.947 
      +/- 0.308 vs 0.619 +/- 0.176 mm; P < 0.001). IMT was related with age (r = 0.268; P 
      = 0.038), diabetic (r = 0.650; P < 0.001) and hypertensive condition (r = 0.333; P = 
      0.012), but not wih lipids, tHcy or FA. Patients who suffered from coronary artery 
      disease, peripheral artery disease or stroke had higher IMT than those without those 
      events (1.156 +/- 0.371 vs 0.875 +/- 0.285 mm; P < 0.001; 1.205 +/- 0.374 vs 0.911 
      +/- 0.231 mm; P = 0.007; 1.195 +/- 0.264 vs 0.844 +/- 0.251; P < 0.001 
      respectively). Something similar occurred with the presence of plaques. During the 
      follow-up period 36 patients died (60%), 67% of them due to cardiovascular causes. 
      IMT was higher in patients who died than those who survived (1.020 +/- 0.264 vs 
      0.858 +/- 0.334 mm; P = 0.044). The survival rate during the observation period was 
      significantly lower in the final IMT fourth (20%) than in the first (72%) (P = 
      0.014). The presence of carotid plaques was an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggests that measurement of 
      carotid IMT and the presence of wall plaques are useful tools to predict 
      cardiovascular events and mortality in patients in MHD.

TI  - Role of coronary artery calcification score on the decrease in GFR among subjects 
      with CT coronary angiography.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.3109/10641963.2011.628725 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Higher levels of coronary artery calcification score (CACS) are 
      associated not only with an increased risk for cardiovascular death, but also with 
      lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs). However, its role in renal disease 
      progression in patients has not been elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 
      the change of estimated GFR in 279 nondialytic outpatients, who had undergone 
      computed tomographic coronary angiography and follow-up over a period of 3 months. 
      RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 57.7 ± 10.5 years, and the mean GFR 
      was 88.2 ± 15.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Although there was no difference in baseline GFR 
      between the CACS ≤ 200 AU group (n = 240) and the CACS > 200 AU group (n = 39), the 
      latter group had a lower level of final GFR and higher annual reduction rate of GFR 
      than the former group after an observation period of 13.1 ± 5.97 months. After 
      adjusting for confounding variables, including age, gender, baseline GFR, albumin, 
      and proteinuria, high levels of CACS showed an independent association with an 
      annual reduction rate of GFR (r = -0.142, P = .048). CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      suggest that CACS was related to an annual decrease in GFR and may predict the 
      faster decline in GFR in patients with symptoms requiring computed tomographic 
      coronary angiography.

TI  - The influence of atherosclerosis and plasma D-dimer concentration in patients with a 
      functioning arteriovenous fistula for maintenance hemodialysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to deduce the influence of atherosclerosis and 
      plasma D-dimer concentration on the functioning of arteriovenous fistulae for 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: The study was organized as a prospective and non-randomized 
      investigation in the "Kragujevac" Clinical Center. The 81 examined patients, 49 
      (60.5%) males and 32 (39.5%) females, were divided into a group (n = 36) requiring 
      several attempts to create arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis and a group (n = 
      45) with no complications of arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis. The 
      demographic structure, etiology of renal disease, biochemical parameters and 
      concentration of D-dimer were analyzed at the beginning of the study and 1 year 
      later, as well as the existence of tissue calcification and Duplex ultrasound 
      parameters of the carotid artery. RESULTS: The patients with arteriovenous fistulae 
      complications were significantly older (58.4 +/- 12.9 vs. 52.3 +/- 11.6 years; P = 
      0.026). High venous pressure (98.6 +/- 29.98 vs. 80 +/- 33.57 mmHg; P = 0.005) and 
      soft-tissue calcification (P = 0.03) were correlated with the occurrence of 
      arteriovenous fistula complications. The greatest risk for failure of fistula was 
      within the first month after creation of the anastomosis (failure rate was 0.235). 
      The hemoglobin concentration (89 +/- 14.0 vs. 96.6 +/- 17.7 g/l; P = 0.048) was 
      lower, and concentration of D-dimer at the end of the study was higher (219.56 +/- 
      193.05 vs. 332.03 +/- 149.48; P = 0.012) in patients with vascular access 
      complications. By Cox regression analysis, the concentration of fibrin D-dimer at 
      the end of the study was shown to be a significant predictor of fistula survival 
      (beta = 0.002; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Complications of arteriovenous fistulae were 
      more often recorded in older patients. The greatest risk for fistula functioning was 
      within the first month after creation of the anastomosis. Vein pressure and anemia 
      were important indicators of arteriovenous fistula complications. D-dimer was a 
      significant marker of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis.

TI  - Usefulness of rotational atherectomy for the implantation of drug-eluting stents in 
      the calcified lesions of hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 232-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jjcc.2009.11.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents (DES) have significantly reduced in-stent 
      restenosis. But the calcification of coronary artery lesions in hemodialysis 
      patients is a high-risk factor for restenosis after DES implantation. We 
      hypothesized that percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA) 
      may be useful in the prevention of underexpansion and fracture of the stents, 
      thereby reducing major adverse cardiac events. METHODS: We retrospectively compared 
      the primary success and mid-term outcomes (major adverse cardiac events within 12 
      months) of hemodialysis patients with calcified coronary lesions undergoing DES 
      implantation using PTCRA (n=26) with those where DES was implanted without PTCRA 
      (n=28). RESULTS: The rates of target lesion revascularization in the PTCRA group 
      were lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (11.5% vs 35.7%, p=0.026). The rates of 
      restenosis and subacute thrombosis in the PTCRA group were modestly lower than those 
      in the non-PTCRA group (restenosis rate, 17.4% vs 17.4%, p=0.061; subacute 
      thrombosis rate, 0% vs 7.1%, p=0.31). CONCLUSION: PTCRA may be useful for improving 
      the mid-term outcome of DES implantation in hemodialysis patients with calcified 
      lesions.

TI  - Study on the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients with consideration of seasonal variation in 
      vitamin D levels.
PG  - 563-8
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between seasonal 
      variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification. METHODS: As a prospective 
      observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We have assessed serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer (September) and winter 
      (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association of serum 25D level with 
      vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D levels 
      were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were 
      studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by Kauppila. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the summer and increased to 
      96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and diabetes were associated with 
      vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate analysis, 25D levels were inversely 
      related to vascular calcification. However, after correcting for confounding 
      factors, this relationship lost statistical significance. Multivariate analysis 
      showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels were directly 
      associated with a higher VCS. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent 
      in HD patients with marked seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be 
      identified as an independent predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.

AB  - The impact of lesion calcium on long-term outcomes after drug-eluting stent 
      implantation has not been adequately addressed. In 10,595 patients (16,803 lesions) 
      who were exclusively treated with sirolimus-eluting stents in the j-Cypher registry, 
      5-year outcomes were compared between patients with ≥1 lesion with moderate or 
      severe calcification (the calcium group) and those with noncalcified lesions only 
      (the noncalcium group). Analyses were stratified by hemodialysis (HD) status (non-HD 
      stratum [calcium n = 3,191, noncalcium n = 6,824] and HD stratum [calcium n = 415, 
      noncalcium n = 165]). Adjusted risk in the calcium group for death and target lesion 
      revascularization was significant in the non-HD stratum (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.52, p <0.0001, and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.36, p 
      = 0.003) and the HD stratum (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.86, p = 0.02, and HR 2.25, 95% 
      CI 1.51 to 3.36, p <0.0001). Risk for definite stent thrombosis tended to be higher 
      in the calcium group in the HD stratum (HR 5.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 38.9, p = 0.12) but 
      not in then non-HD stratum (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.67, p = 0.41). The use of 
      rotational atherectomy in patients with severe calcification did not have a 
      significant impact on the cumulative incidence of target lesion revascularization in 
      the non-HD stratum (17.7% [n = 268] with vs 18.2% [n = 588] without rotational 
      atherectomy, p = 0.68) and the HD stratum (54.7% [n = 115] with vs 51.9% [n = 118] 
      without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.19). In conclusion, regardless of HD status, 
      patients with calcified lesions have increased long-term risk for death and target 
      lesion revascularization after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation.

TI  - Serum albumin, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and fetuin a as predictors of 
      malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in patients with ESRD.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum albumin (S-Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 
      (IL-6) predict malnutrition, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fetuin A, an inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification, also is associated strongly with clinical outcome in 
      patients with ESRD. In this study, multivariate analyses were performed to assess 
      these 4 biomarkers as predictors of malnutrition, CVD, and mortality in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with ESRD (54 +/- 12 years) 
      underwent measurements of S-Alb, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), plasma IL-6, and 
      fetuin A close to the start of dialysis therapy and were followed up for a median of 
      26 months (range, 1 to 66 months). Nutritional status was evaluated by means of 
      subjective global assessment. CVD was defined based on medical history. Associations 
      between biomarker levels and malnutrition, CVD, and mortality were evaluated by 
      means of receiver operating characteristic curve, logistic regression analysis, and 
      Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: All 4 biomarkers predicted malnutrition, 
      CVD, and mortality. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, showed that malnutrition was predicted best by hs-CRP and 
      IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; and mortality, by albumin and IL-6 levels. When 
      using the cutoff levels derived from receiver operating characteristics, logistic 
      regression analysis showed that only hs-CRP level (odds ratio [OR], 3.6) was 
      associated with malnutrition, and only IL-6 level (OR, 3.7) was associated with CVD. 
      Levels of S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A, but not hs-CRP, were associated with increased 
      relative risk for mortality as assessed by Cox in a model adjusting for age, sex, 
      and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analyses show that in patients with 
      ESRD, malnutrition is predicted best by hs-CRP and IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; 
      and mortality, by S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A levels, but not by hs-CRP level. This 
      comparative analysis indicates that of these biomarkers, IL-6 level may be the most 
      reliable predictor of CVD and mortality in patients with ESRD.

TI  - [Cardiovascular assessment of non diabetic patients on hemodialysis].
PG  - 351-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for cardiovascular 
      complications among patients on hemodialysis. However, the incidence of these 
      complications among non diabetic patients on hemodialysis is not well known. AIM: To 
      assess the incidence of cardiovascular complications in non diabetic patients on 
      hemodialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy five non diabetic patients aged 55.6 +/- 
      17 years (48 males), receiving hemodialysis three times a week were evaluated with 
      laboratory tests, echocardiogram anda carotid ultrasound. In 26 patients, 
      interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and intercellular adhesión molecule 
      (ICAM-1) were also measured. Patients were followed during two years. RESULTS: The 
      mean lapse of dialysis therapy was 6.5 +/-5 years. The main cause of renal failure 
      was hypertension. Sixty two percent had systolic hypertension, 86% had concentric 
      left ventricular hypertrophy, 43% had atrial dilatation and 60% had calcifications 
      in the thoracic aorta. Compared with normal controls, patients had higher levels of 
      interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and ICAM-1. Carotid media thickness was 
      also higher and increased in the two years of follow up. No correlations were found 
      between ventricular hypertrophy and dialysis lapse, packed red cell volume, calcium 
      phosphorus product, parathormone levels or median arterial pressure. No 
      cardiovascular events were recorded during the follow up period. CONCLUSIONS: Non 
      diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis have a high frequency of ventricular 
      hypertrophy, carotid media thickening, aortic calcifications and an increase in 
      proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  - Progression of aortic arch calcification over 1 year is an independent predictor of 
      mortality in incident peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - e48793
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048793 [doi]
LID - e48793
AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: The presence and progression of vascular calcification have 
      been demonstrated as important risk factors for mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, since the majority of subjects included in most previous studies were 
      hemodialysis patients, limited information was available in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of 
      aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and prognostic value of AoAC progression in PD 
      patients. METHODS: We prospectively determined AoAC by chest X-ray at PD start and 
      after 12 months, and evaluated the impact of AoAC progression on mortality in 415 
      incident PD patients. RESULTS: Of 415 patients, 169 patients (40.7%) had AoAC at 
      baseline with a mean of 18.1±11.2%. The presence of baseline AoAC was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause [Hazard ratio (HR): 2.181, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.336-3.561, P = 0.002] and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.582, 95% CI: 
      1.577-8.132, P = 0.002). Among 363 patients with follow-up chest X-rays at 12 months 
      after PD start, the proportion of patients with AoAC progression was significantly 
      higher in patients with baseline AoAC (64.2 vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Moreover, all-cause 
      and cardiovascular death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups 
      than in the non-progression group (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that 
      AoAC progression was an independent predictor for all-cause (HR: 2.625, 95% CI: 
      1.150-5.991, P = 0.022) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 4.008, 95% CI: 
      1.079-14.890, P = 0.038) in patients with AoAC at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were independently 
      associated with unfavorable outcomes in incident PD patients. Regular follow-up by 
      chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in these 
      patients.

TI  - Bone mineral density in children with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - Bone mineral density (BMD) is important in children and adolescents because of its 
      relationship to long-term skeletal health, and because, in adults with chronic renal 
      failure (CRF), a relationship between low BMD and vascular calcification has been 
      suggested. To investigate the relationship between BMD and manipulable factors that 
      might affect it, i.e. plasma calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH), 64 
      patients with a median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 31 (range 7-60) ml 
      min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) and median age of 10.0 (4.1-16.9) years were followed over 1.3 
      (0.7-1.7) years at an average of 5 (3-14) clinic visits. At one visit, BMD of the 
      lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The mean BMD Z-score 
      was normal (=0.0). Overall mean calcium, phosphate and PTH levels were in their 
      respective normal ranges. The majority of the patients (72%) were treated with 
      calcium carbonate, mean dose 65 mg kg(-1) day(-1); prescription was positively 
      related to serum calcium levels and calcium-phosphate product (P=0.012 and P<0.01 
      respectively). Almost all patients (98%) were treated with alfacalcidol, mean dose 
      12 ng kg(-1) day(-1); prescription was not related to investigated factors. Patients 
      grew well; there was no change in height standard deviation score (DeltaHtSDS=0.0). 
      Normal BMD Z-score for age and sex can be achieved in children with CRF managed with 
      the aim of maintaining normal PTH levels by dietary phosphate restriction, 
      calcium-based phosphate binders and small doses of alfacalcidol. Further 
      investigation of the underlying bone by the use of biopsy and histomorphometry is 
      required to determine actual bone health.

TI  - Mortality effect of coronary calcification and phosphate binder choice in incident 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 438-41
AB  - The risk of death in hemodialysis patients treated with calcium-containing phosphate 
      binders or sevelamer is not known. We assessed all-cause mortality in 127 patients 
      new to hemodialysis assigned to calcium-containing binders or sevelamer after a 
      median follow-up of 44 months from randomization. This was a predetermined secondary 
      end point of a randomized clinical trial designed to assess progression of coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC) scores in the two treatment arms. Thirty-four deaths occurred 
      during the follow-up period: 23 in subjects randomized to calcium-containing 
      phosphate binders and 11 in subjects randomized to sevelamer. Baseline CAC score was 
      a significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age, race, gender, and 
      diabetes with increased mortality proportional to baseline score (P=0.002). 
      Mortality was borderline significantly lower in subjects randomized to sevelamer 
      (5.3/100 patient years, confidence interval (CI) (2.2-8.5) compared to those 
      randomized to calcium-containing binders (10.6/100 patient years, CI 6.3-14.9) 
      (P=0.05). The greater risk of death for patients treated with calcium-containing 
      phosphate binders persisted after full multivariable adjustment (P=0.016, hazard 
      ratio 3.1, CI 1.23-7.61). In subjects new to hemodialysis baseline CAC score was a 
      significant predictor of all-cause mortality. Treatment with sevelamer was 
      associated with a significant survival benefit as compared to the use of 
      calcium-containing phosphate binders.

TI  - Hereditary polycystic kidney disease associated with osteorenal syndrome in rats.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD) was seen in Han:SPRD rats and identified 
      as an autosomal, incomplete dominant trait. Homozygous animals died at 3 to 4 weeks 
      of age, while heterozygous males were severely ill or moribund within about 6 
      months. Heterozygous females developed PKD to a lesser extent than males and 
      survived longer. Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteodystrophia fibrosa 
      were seen in most males but were absent in females. In male rats metastatic 
      calcification was found in kidneys, lungs, glandular and forestomach, blood vessels, 
      and heart. In a few uremic males ulcerative enteritis occurred in cecum and colon. 
      Blood urea nitrogen values were significantly increased in both sexes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal aortic calcification (AC) has been reported to be 
      associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hemodialysis patients but is rarely 
      discussed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We examined the independent 
      predictors and predictive power for survival of AC in prevalent PD patients. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: AC was detected by computed tomography (CT) and represented as the 
      percentage of the total aortic cross-section area affected by AC (%AC). The 
      predictors of %AC ≥ 15 were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Cox 
      proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the hazard ratios associated with 
      high %AC. A total of 183 PD patients were recruited to receive CT scans and divided 
      into group 1 (%AC < 15, n = 97), group 2 (%AC ≥ 15, n = 41), and group 3 (diabetic 
      patients, n = 45). Group 1 patients had lower osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels than 
      group 2 patients (798 ± 378 vs. 1308 ± 1350 pg/mL, p < 0.05). The independent 
      predictors for %AC ≥ 15 included the atherogenic index, OPG, and C-reactive protein 
      (CRP). The age-adjusted hazard ratios associated with %AC ≥ 15 were 3.46 (p = 0.043) 
      for mortality and 1.90 (p = 0.007) for hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: %AC can predict 
      mortality and morbidity in non-diabetic PD patients, and 15% is a good cut-off value 
      for such predictions. There are complex associations among mineral metabolism, 
      inflammation, and dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of AC.

TI  - Coral reef aorta: a long-term study of 21 patients.
PG  - 626-33
AB  - Coral reef aorta is a rare calcifying disease of the juxtarenal and suprarenal 
      aorta. We report here our surgical experience in treating 21 patients, with a mean 
      follow-up of 4 years and 7 months. Both genders were equally affected. Ten male 
      (48%) and 11 female (52%) patients with a mean age of 54.6 years (range 42-76 years) 
      underwent surgery. The main symptoms were limb claudication (n = 11, 52%), 
      renovascular stenosis (n = 9, 43%) with concurrent renovascular hypertension (n = 5, 
      24%), and angina abdominalis (n = 7, 33%). Most patients had multiorgan vascular 
      disease such as iliofemoral arterial occlusive disease (n = 14, 66%), coronary 
      artery obstruction (n = 8, 38%), or obstruction of the carotid artery (n = 6, 28%). 
      Risk factors did not differ between coral reef patients and those with other 
      occlusive vascular diseases. All patients were treated through vascular operations, 
      including open thromboendarterectomy of the suprarenal (n = 9, 43%), infrarenal (n = 
      4, 19%), or supra- and infrarenal aorta (n = 8, 38%), and thromboendarterectomy of 
      the following vessels: celiac artery (n = 7, 33%), superior mesenteric artery (n = 
      12, 57%), inferior mesenteric artery (n = 3, 14%), unilateral renal artery (n = 3, 
      14%), or bilateral renal artery (n = 9, 43%). Bypass reconstructions were performed 
      in 39% (n = 8). A thoracoabdominal approach was used in 14 patients (67%) and a 
      median laparotomy in 7 (33%). Our results show that coral reef aorta is not confined 
      to either gender. It appears most frequently in the context of general 
      atherosclerotic disease and patients benefit from timely diagnosis and operation 
      before onset of severe, life-threatening visceral and renal complications.

TI  - SIRTUIN 1 gene polymorphisms are associated with cholesterol metabolism and coronary 
      artery calcification in Japanese hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 114-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity gene, protects cells against oxidative 
      and genotoxic stress. This study aimed to investigate the association of SIRT 1 gene 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms, namely, rs7895833, rs7069102, and rs2273773 with 
      lipid profiles and coronary artery calcification score in 219 Japanese hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. METHODS: Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers assay. RESULTS: The A 
      allele frequency of rs7895833 and G allele frequency of rs7069102 were significantly 
      lower in HD patients (0.228 and 0.131, respectively) than those in 803 control 
      subjects (general population) (0.289 and 0.181, respectively) (P = .010 and P = 
      .012, respectively). However, the allele frequency of rs2273773 was not 
      significantly different from that in the control subjects. Multivariate analysis 
      adjusted for age and duration on HD demonstrated that the serum levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly high in G allele carriers of 
      rs7069102 compared with CC genotype in male HD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcification score was significantly high in C allele carriers of rs2273773 in all 
      and male HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT 1 polymorphisms, rs7069102 and rs2273773, 
      are associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism and coronary artery 
      calcification, respectively, in Japanese HD patients, especially in males.

TI  - 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels inversely associate with risk for developing coronary 
      artery calcification.
PG  - 1805-12
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2008111157 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency associates with increased risk for cardiovascular events and 
      mortality, but the mechanism driving this association is unknown. Here, we tested 
      whether circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration associates with coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, in the 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 1370 participants: 394 with and 
      976 without chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). At 
      baseline, CAC was prevalent among 723 (53%) participants. Among participants free of 
      CAC at baseline, 135 (21%) developed incident CAC during 3 yr of follow-up. Lower 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration did not associate with prevalent CAC but did 
      associate with increased risk for developing incident CAC, adjusting for age, 
      gender, race/ethnicity, site, season, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, 
      and kidney function. Further adjustment for BP, diabetes, C-reactive protein, and 
      lipids did not alter this finding. The association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with 
      incident CAC seemed to be stronger among participants with lower estimated GFR. 
      Circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations among participants with chronic 
      kidney disease did not significantly associate with prevalent or incident CAC in 
      adjusted models. In conclusion, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations associate 
      with increased risk for incident CAC. Accelerated development of atherosclerosis may 
      underlie, in part, the increased cardiovascular risk associated with vitamin D 
      deficiency.

TI  - Low serum fetuin-A concentration predicts poor outcome only in the presence of 
      inflammation in prevalent haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 804-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02032.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular 
      calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote 
      vascular calcification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of 
      inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 
      222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. RESULTS: Serum fetuin correlated 
      negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating 
      inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher 
      mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was 
      lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and 
      inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly 
      independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed 
      compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same 
      variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high 
      fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with 
      high fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are 
      associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of 
      inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and 
      low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Clinical outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - The clinical results of percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy 
      (PTCRA) in dialysis patients were retrospectively evaluated in comparison with 
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). From 1997 to 2001, 44 consecutive dialysis 
      patients with 61 lesions underwent PTCRA and 55 consecutive dialysis patients 
      underwent CABG. The initial success rate of PTCRA was 98%. The PTCRA group had a 
      shorter hospital stay (13+/-17 vs 60+/-35 days, p=0.0001) and a lower rate of 
      complications (11% vs 42%, p=0.001) than the CABG group. Although neither event-free 
      survival without death nor myocardial infarction (MI) was significantly different 
      between the CABG and PTCRA groups during the mean follow-up period of 21+/-14 
      months, 20 patients (45%) in the PTCRA group needed repeat revascularization of the 
      target lesion. In conclusion, PTCRA may be a safe alternative modality for 
      revascularization of high-risk CABG candidates, with excellent short-term results 
      although the long-term outcome is inferior to that of CABG because of the higher 
      restenosis rate.

TI  - Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia in chronically dialyzed patients: a disease with 
      multiple risk factors.
PG  - c87-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) can be a fatal complication in 
      dialysis patients. Intradialytic hypotension is usually the precipitating factor. 
      The occurrence of 16 cases in 5 years (1998-2002), compared with only 4 in previous 
      years, led us to investigate other risk factors contributing to NOMI. A control 
      group of stable hemodialysis patients was used for comparison. RESULTS: 20 patients 
      were studied: 17 diagnosed surgically, and 3 clinically. The mean age was 70.8 +/- 
      1.8 years, and the male:female ratio 7:13. Nineteen patients were on hemodialysis. 
      Clinically overt atherosclerosis was present in 17 patients. Preceding 
      dialysis-associated hypotension was identified in all patients studied and access 
      thrombosis in 6 patients. In all patients, abdominal pain was the presenting 
      symptom. Initial abdominal examination was unimpressive in 16 patients. The 
      hemoconcentration, leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis were the most prominent 
      laboratory findings. 5/11 abdominal sonograms showed intestinal pathology. 2/3 
      angiographies were diagnostic. Three patients responded to early fluid challenge and 
      did not require surgery. Pathology was related to the area of the superior 
      mesenteric artery in all 15 patients operated. Twelve (60%) patients died from the 
      event. The 1-year mortality rate was 17/20 patients (85%). Possible contributing 
      factors, other than dialysis-associated hypotension, included: high-dose recombinant 
      human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapy (179 +/- 35 vs. 116 +/- 10 U/kg/week in the 
      control group, p < 0.05); metastatic calcifications (abdominal aorta 14/14, aortic 
      valve 11/18; medial calcification of mesenteric arteries in 2/11 pathology 
      specimens); digoxin, and hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of 
      NOMI in dialysis patients may be related to overly aggressive rhEPO therapy and the 
      unsuspected presence of mesenteric arterial medial calcifications. Identification of 
      patients at risk, prevention of intradialytic hypotension and a controlled increase 
      in dry weight may help to reduce the incidence of NOMI in chronically dialyzed 
      patients.

AB  - Malnutrition, inflammation, and renal osteodystrophy parameters with resultant 
      coronary calcification (CC) are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality 
      in adults. Previous pediatric studies demonstrated CC in children but none assessed 
      for an association between inflammation, malnutrition, renal osteodystrophy, and CC. 
      To assess CC, ultrafast computerized tomogram was obtained for 16 pediatric patients 
      (6 females; median age 17.2 years; range 9.1-21.2 years) receiving hemodialysis for 
      >/=2 months. Inflammation was assessed by serum IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein 
      levels on the day of the computerized tomogram scan; nutrition parameters included 
      serum albumin, cholesterol, the body mass index standard deviation score, and 
      normalized protein catabolic rate. Renal osteodystrophy parameters included 
      time-averaged serum calcium, phosphorus, total PTH, and calcitriol/calcium dose. 
      Patients received hemodialysis thrice-weekly; mean single pool Kt/V 1.48+/-0.13; and 
      mean normalized protein catabolic rate 1.27+/-0.17 g/kg/day. Five of 16 patients had 
      CC. Patients with CC were older (19.1+/-2.1 vs. 15.4+/-3.1 months; P=0.03), had 
      longer dialysis vintage (49.4+/-15.3 vs. 17.2+/-10.5 months, P=0.0002), lower serum 
      cholesterol (122+/-17.7 vs. 160.4+/-10.6 mg/dL, P=0.02), and higher phosphorus 
      (9.05+/-1.2 vs. 6.1+/-0.96 mg/dL, P=0.0001). Mean serum albumin and normalized 
      protein catabolic rate did not differ for patients with CC. All patients had 
      elevated IL-6 and IL-8 levels compared with healthy norms; the mean IL-6, IL-8, and 
      C-reactive protein levels were not different in patients with CC. Coronary 
      calcification was prevalent in older children receiving maintenance hemodialysis 
      with a longer dialysis vintage. Worse renal osteodystrophy control and malnutrition 
      (low cholesterol) may contribute to CC development.

TI  - Phosphate binder impact on bone remodeling and coronary calcification--results from 
      the BRiC study.
PG  - c273-83
LID - 10.1159/000170783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Calcium-containing phosphate binders have been shown to 
      increase the progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This is 
      a prospective study that compares the effects of calcium acetate and sevelamer on 
      coronary calcification (CAC) and bone histology. METHODS: 101 hemodialysis patients 
      were randomized for each phosphate binder and submitted to multislice coronary 
      tomographies and bone biopsies at entry and 12 months. RESULTS: The 71 patients who 
      concluded the study had similar baseline characteristics. On follow-up, the 
      sevelamer group had higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone (498 +/- 352 vs. 326 
      +/- 236 pg/ml, p = 0.017), bone alkaline phosphatase (38 +/- 24 vs. 28 +/- 15 U/l, p 
      = 0.03) and deoxypyridinoline (135 +/- 107 vs. 89 +/- 71 nmol/l, p = 0.03) and lower 
      LDL cholesterol (74 +/- 21 vs. 91 +/- 28 mg/dl, p = 0.015). Phosphorus (5.8 +/- 1.0 
      vs. 6 +/- 1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.47) and calcium (1.27 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.68) levels did not differ between groups. CAC progression (35 vs. 24%, p = 
      0.94) and bone histological diagnosis at baseline and 12 months were similar in both 
      groups. Patients of the sevelamer group with a high turnover at baseline had an 
      increase in bone resorption (eroded surface, ES/BS = 9.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.1 +/- 9.5%, 
      p = 0.05), whereas patients of both groups with low turnover at baseline had an 
      improvement in bone formation rate (BFR/BS = 0.015 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.062 +/- 0.078, p 
      = 0.003 for calcium and 0.017 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.071 +/- 0.084 microm(3)/microm(2)/day, 
      p = 0.010 for sevelamer). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in CAC progression or 
      changes in bone remodeling between the calcium and the sevelamer groups.

TI  - Carotid atherosclerosis is a predictor of coronary calcification in chronic 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 885-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) calculated by electron beam 
      computed tomography (EBCT) have been correlated with atherosclerotic burden in the 
      non-uraemic population. However, the validity of this test in chronic haemodialysis 
      patients (HD) is currently uncertain. In the present cross-sectional study, 
      associations between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary calcification in HD 
      patients are investigated. METHODS: We studied 79 chronic HD patients (39 male, 40 
      female; mean age, 45+/-12 years). The mean time on HD was 68+/-54 months (range, 
      6-187 months). In these patients, we measured serum calcium, phosphorus, total 
      cholesterol, cholesterol subgroups and iPTH levels. EBCT, echocardiography, and 
      high-resolution B-mode carotid Doppler ultrasonography were also performed. RESULTS: 
      Plaque-positive HD patients had significantly higher CACS than plaque-negative 
      patients (851+/-199 vs 428+/-185, mean+/-SE, P = 0.006). Coronary calcification 
      scores were correlated with serum phosphorus (r = 0.37; P = 0.001). Only 8 of the 24 
      HD patients without coronary calcification had carotid plaques (33%), whereas 34 of 
      the 53 patients with coronary calcification had carotid plaques (64%) (P = 0.015). 
      Carotid plaque scores were correlated with CACS (r = 0.40; P = 0.001). A stepwise 
      linear regression (model r = 0.72; P<0.001) revealed that CACS (log-transformed data 
      of CACS) was associated with age (P<0.001), time on dialysis (P = 0.004), serum 
      phosphorus level (P = 0.016) and carotid plaque scores (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Atherosclerosis is independently associated with coronary artery calcification and 
      with hyperphosphataemia in chronic HD patients. CACS appeared to be predictive of 
      both coronary atherosclerosis and carotid atherosclerosis.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are independently associated with 
      left ventricular mass and myocardial performance index in maintenance haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1346-54

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is a phosphorus-regulating 
      substance. Circulating FGF-23 levels increase markedly in dialysis patients and are 
      independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Given the fact that 
      cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in dialysis patients, the aim 
      of this study was to test if elevated FGF-23 levels might be associated with left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular index of myocardial performance 
      (MPI) in maintenance haemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 
      plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay kit, and echocardiography was performed in 128 maintenance 
      haemodialysis patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean 
      haemodialysis vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are on haemodialysis thrice a 
      week) and 40 control subjects (21 women and 19 men; mean age: 54 ± 11 years) with 
      normal kidney function (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). RESULTS: Serum FGF-23 levels 
      were elevated when compared with age- and gender-matched controls with preserved 
      kidney function [(median 958 RU/mL; interquartile range 106-1894 RU/mL) vs (median 
      27 RU/mL; interquartile range 11-35), P < 0.0001]. Patients with a history of 
      coronary artery disease and aortic valve calcifications had higher levels of log 
      FGF-23 than those without (3.00 ± 0.22 vs 2.82 ± 0.26, P = 0.002; and 3.06 ± 0.19 vs 
      2.83 ± 0.26, P = 0.0001, respectively). Patients with MPI > 0.47 had higher serum 
      FGF-23 levels than those with MPI < 0.47 [(median 1156 RU/mL; interquartile range 
      396-1894 RU/mL) vs (median 657 RU/mL; interquartile range 106-1102 RU/mL), P = 
      0.0001]. Significant correlations were recorded between log FGF-23 levels and LVMI 
      (r = 0.281, P = 0,007) and MPI (r = 0.555, P = 0.0001). Multivariable-adjusted 
      regression analyses revealed that increased log FGF-23 concentrations were 
      independently associated with increased left ventricular mass index (30% increase 
      per 1-SD increase in log FGF-23 concentration, P = 0.002) and increased MPI (28.5% 
      increase per 1-SD increase in log FGF-23 concentration, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Plasma FGF-23 concentration is independently associated with LVMI and MPI in 
      maintenance haemodialysis patients. Further prospective studies are needed to 
      clarify whether increased serum FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism 
      for left ventricular involvement in patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - All-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients with heart valve calcification.
PG  - 1990-5
LID - 10.2215/CJN.01140211 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calcification of the mitral and aortic valves is common 
      in dialysis patients (CKD-5D). However, the prognostic significance of valvular 
      calcification (VC) in CKD is not well established. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: 144 adult CKD-5D patients underwent bidimensional echocardiography for 
      qualitative assessment of VC and cardiac computed tomography (CT) for quantification 
      of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and VC. The patients were followed for a median of 
      5.6 years for mortality from all causes. RESULTS: Overall, 38.2% of patients had 
      mitral VC and 44.4% had aortic VC on echocardiography. Patients with VC were older 
      and less likely to be African American; all other characteristics were similar 
      between groups. The mortality rate of patients with calcification of either valve 
      was higher than for patients without VC. After adjustment for age, gender, race, 
      diabetes mellitus, and history of atherosclerotic disease, only mitral VC remained 
      independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 2.91). Patients with calcification of both valves 
      had a two-fold increased risk of death during follow-up compared with patients 
      without VC (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.08). A combined CT score of VC and CAC was 
      strongly associated with all-cause mortality during follow-up (HR for highest versus 
      lowest tertile, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.54). CONCLUSIONS: VC is associated with a 
      significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality in CKD-5D patients. These 
      findings support the use of echocardiography for risk stratification in CKD-5D as 
      recently suggested in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines.

TI  - Elevated concentrations of cardiac troponins are associated with severe coronary 
      artery calcification in asymptomatic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 3117-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers, such as troponins and 
      natriuretic peptides, have been shown to be predictive of poorer long-term 
      cardiovascular outcomes in stable patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
      However, little is known about the relationship between elevated concentrations of 
      these cardiac markers and underlying coronary artery pathology in these patients. 
      The aim of the present study was to investigate associations between coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) and the concentrations of cardiac biomarkers in ESRD patients. 
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 38 asymptomatic patients (median 
      age, 54 years; 26 males, 12 females; diabetic, 39%) who were undergoing chronic 
      haemodialysis. In these patients, pre-dialysis circulating concentrations of cardiac 
      troponin T (cTnT), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and B-type 
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured. We quantified the level of CAC by multirow 
      spiral computed tomography to obtain a CAC score. CAC scores > or = 400 were defined 
      as being indicative of severe CAC. RESULTS: Severe CAC was detected in 17 patients 
      (45%). The degree of CAC severity was positively associated (P < 0.05) with cTnT 
      concentrations. Thus, 15% of patients had severe CAC in the lowest tertile of cTnT, 
      50% had severe CAC in the middle third, and 69% in the highest third. Similarly, the 
      degree of severity of CAC was positively associated (P < 0.01) with cTnI 
      concentrations across concentration categories. In contrast, there was no 
      association between the degree of CAC severity and the concentrations of either BNP 
      or CK-MB. A logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated concentrations of 
      cTnT (> or = median vs <median, P < 0.05) and cTnI (> or = 0.1 ng/ml vs <detection 
      limit, P < 0.05) were independently associated with severe CAC after adjusting for 
      age, duration of dialysis, diabetes and previous cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Elevated concentrations of cTnT and cTnI, but not BNP or CK-MB, were independently 
      associated with the degree of severity of CAC in asymptomatic haemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Normal thoracic aorta diameter on cardiac computed tomography in healthy 
      asymptomatic adults: impact of age and gender.
PG  - 827-34
LID - 10.1016/j.acra.2008.02.001 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To establish the normal criterion of ascending aortic 
      diameter (AAOD) measured by 64 multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and electron 
      beam computed tomography (EBT) based on gender and age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 1442 consecutive subjects who were referred for evaluation of possible 
      coronary artery disease underwent coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography 
      (CTA) and coronary artery calcium scanning (CACS) (55 + 11 years, 65% male) without 
      known coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary and renal disease, 
      diabetes, and severe aortic calcification. The AAOD aortic diameter, descending 
      aortic diameter (DAOD), pulmonary artery (PAD), and chest anteroposterior diameter 
      (CAPD), posterior border of the sternal bone to the anterior border of the spine, 
      were measured at the slice level of mid-right pulmonary artery using end systolic 
      trigger imaging. The volume of four chambers, ejection fraction of left ventricle, 
      and cardiac output were measured in 56% of the patients. Patients' demographic 
      information, age, gender, weight, height, and body surface area were recorded. The 
      mean value and age-specific and gender-adjusted upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 
      standard deviation) were calculated. The linear correlation analysis was done 
      between AAOD and all parameters. The reproducibility, wall thickness, and difference 
      between end-systole and end-diastole were calculated. RESULTS: AAOD has significant 
      linear association with age, gender, DAOD, and pulmonary artery diameter (P < .05). 
      There is no significant correlation between AAOD and body surface area, four-chamber 
      volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and CAPD. The mean 
      intraluminal AAOD was 31.1 +/- 3.9 and 33.6 +/- 4.1 mm in females and males, 
      respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviations) of 
      intraluminal AAOD, were 35.6, 38.3, and 40 mm for females and 37.8, 40.5, and 42.6 
      mm for males in age groups 20-40, 41-60, and older than 60 years, respectively. 
      Intraluminal aortic diameters should parallel echocardiography and invasive 
      angiography. Traditional cross-sectional imaging (with CT and magnetic resonance 
      imaging) includes the vessel wall. The mean total AAOD was 33.5 and 36.0 mm in 
      females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard 
      deviations) of intraluminal AAOD were 38.0, 40.7 and 42.4 mm for females and 40.2, 
      42.9, and 45.0 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, and older than 60 
      years, respectively. The inter- and intraobserver, scanner, and repeated measurement 
      variabilities were low (r value >0.91, P < .001, coefficient variation <3.2%). AAOD 
      was 1.7 mm smaller in end-diastole than end-systole (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      AAOD increases with age and male gender. Gender-specific and age-adjusted normal 
      values for aortic diameters are necessary to differentiate pathologic 
      atherosclerotic changes in the ascending aorta. Use of intraluminal or total aortic 
      diameter values depends on the comparison study employed.

TI  - Transcutaneous oxygen tension in patients with calciphylaxis.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a severe complication of chronic renal failure, confined almost 
      exclusively to patients on dialysis therapy. Histological characteristics of 
      calciphylaxis include small-vessel calcifications of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and 
      visceral organs. These vascular changes promote tissue ischemia that often results 
      in tissue necrosis. In this study, we investigated the extent of skin ischemia in 
      patients with calciphylaxis by means of transcutaneous oxygen tension (TCPO(2)) 
      measurement, a noninvasive test that accurately assesses skin oxygenation. TCPO(2) 
      levels were measured in 21 patients with calciphylaxis and 21 age- and sex-matched 
      patients without evidence of calciphylaxis (controls). TCPO(2) levels were measured 
      bilaterally at the chest, anterior abdomen, and upper thigh while patients breathed 
      room air and after a 30-minute exposure to 100% fraction of inspired oxygen 
      (FIO(2)). Compared with controls, patients with calciphylaxis showed significantly 
      lower TCPO(2) levels at each body region. In both controls and patients with 
      calciphylaxis, lower TCPO(2) levels correlated with increased weight and use of 
      hemodialysis. No correlation with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, or 
      serum phosphorus values was present, although 39% of the patients with calciphylaxis 
      had markedly elevated PTH values (sixfold greater than normal; >300 pg/dL). Low 
      TCPO(2) levels in patients with calciphylaxis were documented in body regions with 
      and without skin lesions. In patients with calciphylaxis, extremely low TCPO(2) 
      values (</=30 mm Hg while patients breathed room air) were present in 62% of the 
      body regions with skin lesions and 26% of the body regions without lesions. Room-air 
      TCPO(2) levels </=30 mm Hg were present in only 0.8% of the body regions of control 
      patients. TCPO(2) levels obtained while patients breathed 100% FIO(2) remained lower 
      in patients with calciphylaxis than in controls. In conclusion, TCPO(2) levels are 
      abnormally low in patients with calciphylaxis, indicating that severe and diffuse 
      skin ischemia exists, even at areas free of skin lesions. Low TCPO(2) values did not 
      substantially increase with 100% FIO(2) in many patients with calciphylaxis, 
      suggesting a fixed insufficiency of the skin vessels. This study shows that TCPO(2) 
      measurements may allow rapid and noninvasive screening for skin ischemia before the 
      development of skin lesions in patients with calciphylaxis.

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients, especially with diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. No randomized 
      studies have been published regarding the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on VC 
      progression in DM patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 
      lanthanum carbonate on the progression of VC in HD patients with type 2 DM. We 
      conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing LC with calcium carbonate (CC) in 
      43 HD patients at a single dialysis center. Estimations of aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography were performed twice for each patient 
      (at baseline and 12 months). Forty-one patients completed the study (19 LC, 22 CC). 
      When ACI at baseline was ≦0.48 (median of baseline ACI), median change in ACI 
      (Δ%ACI) was 20.44 (11.50-36.80%) in the LC group, and 40.00 (33.30-92.60%) in the CC 
      group (P = 0.026). On the other hand, when ACI at baseline was >0.48, the median 
      change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 6.42 (3.13-24.40%) in the LC group, and 8.08 (5.68-12.20%) 
      in the CC group (P = 1.000). Serum markers of chronic kidney disease-mineral and 
      bone disorder (CKD-MBD), HbA1c, dose of vitamin D analogues, and side-effects of 
      medications did not change in either group throughout the study except int-PTH 
      increased in the LC group. This study indicated that administration of LC inhibited 
      the progression of VC in patients receiving HD for type 2 DM, only in cases of 
      slight VC compared with CC.

TI  - Does electron beam computer tomography provide added value in the diagnosis of 
      coronary artery disease?
PG  - 385-93
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Electron beam computer tomography (EBCT) is increasingly being 
      used to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD) in the asymptomatic patient. The aim 
      of this review is to assess the current findings concerning EBCT in the diagnosis 
      and prognostication of CAD. RECENT FINDINGS: Review of the English language 
      peer-reviewed medical literature for EBCT was done with emphasis on the diagnosis 
      and prognosis of CAD. SUMMARY: The goal of risk stratification is to limit 
      aggressive and costly care to group of high-risk patients. EBCT has been used to 
      track the progression of coronary atherosclerosis periodically. Studies have shown 
      that the calcium score will increase from 18 to 22% per year and depends on the age, 
      sex and renal function. Patients with end-stage renal disease have much higher 
      counts. Because it is cheap and noninvasive, EBCT has been used to assess the 
      effects of medications on velocity of increase in the calcium scores. There is 
      concern about radiation for its use long term to assess the calcium score increase 
      over a long period of time.

TI  - Impact of high coronary artery calcification score (CACS) on survival in patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) is a noninvasive measure of 
      coronary artery calcification and, therefore, could be a marker of developing 
      cardiovascular disease. Whether the coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a 
      prognostic marker in chronic dialysis patients is not known. METHODS: In the present 
      study, the mortality rate was observed in relation to the baseline CACS. EBCT was 
      performed in 104 chronic hemodialysis patients (62 men and 42 women) in one dialysis 
      unit. The mean (SD) duration of hemodialysis was 48.7 (62.6) months at the time of 
      EBCT. The mean (SD) age at EBCT was 55.9 (13.6) years, ranging from 23 to 88 years. 
      The duration of follow-up was 43.8 (19.3) months after the EBCT. Cox proportional 
      hazard analysis was performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival after 
      adjusting for age, sex, duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, serum 
      albumin, and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: The CACS was distributed from zero to 5896, with 
      a median of 200. During the study period, 24 patients (15 men and 9 women) died, 7 
      in the low CACS group (<200) and 17 in the high CACS group (> or =200). The 5-year 
      cumulative survival rate was 84.2% in the low CACS group and 67.9% in the high CACS 
      group. The adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) of death was 1.001 
      (1.000-1.002); P = 0.0003, for the absolute value of CACS. CONCLUSIONS: The present 
      study suggested that CACS was an independent predictor of death in patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis. Patients with a high CACS should be carefully monitored and 
      evaluated for reversible prognostic factors such as dyslipidemia and, probably, 
      hyperphosphatemia and a high value for the calcium x phosphate product.Electron-beam 
      computed tomography (EBCT) is a noninvasive measure of coronary artery calcification 
      and, therefore, could be a marker of developing cardiovascular disease. Whether the 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a prognostic marker in chronic 
      dialysis patients is not known.

TI  - Evaluation of peripheral atherosclerosis: a comparative analysis of angiography and 
      intravascular ultrasound imaging.
PG  - 933-8; discussion 939
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2009.11.034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Angiography remains a critical component for diagnostic imaging and 
      therapeutic intervention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The goal of this 
      study was to compare angiography with corresponding intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) 
      imaging of the same vessels in patients with PAD. METHODS: From 2004 to 2008, 93 
      patients undergoing angiography for PAD were recruited in a prospective 
      observational analysis. At the time of angiography, diseased lower extremities were 
      interrogated using a 10-cm IVUS pullback with registration points. IVUS data were 
      analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for vessel and lumen diameter, plaque 
      volume, plaque composition, and cross-sectional area. Similarly, three vascular 
      surgeons blinded to the IVUS data graded corresponding angiographic images according 
      to vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, degree of calcification, and extent of 
      eccentricity. Statistical analyses of matched IVUS images and angiograms were 
      performed. RESULTS: The distribution of demographic and risk variables were typical 
      for PAD: 54% male, 96% hypertension, 78% hyperlipidemia, 44% diabetic, 87% tobacco 
      history, 65% coronary artery disease, and 10% end-stage renal disease. Symptoms 
      precipitating the angiographic evaluation included claudication (53%), rest pain 
      (18%), and tissue loss (29%). Angiographic and IVUS interpretation were similar for 
      luminal diameters, but external vessel diameter was greater by IVUS imaging (7.0 +/- 
      0.7 vs 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm, P < .05). The two-dimensional diameter method resulted in a 
      significant correlation for stenosis determination (r = 0.84); however, IVUS 
      determination of vessel area stenosis was greater by 10% (95% confidence interval, 
      0.3%-21%, P < .05). IVUS imaging indicated that a higher proportion of plaques were 
      concentric. Grading of calcification was moderate to severe in 40% by angiography 
      but in only 7% by IVUS (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of PAD, angiography 
      and IVUS imaging provide similar luminal diameters and diameter-reducing stenosis 
      measurements. Determination of overall vessel diameter and interpretation of plaque 
      morphology by angiography are discordant from IVUS-derived data.

TI  - Length of interdialytic interval influences serum calcium and phosphorus 
      concentrations.
PG  - 1643-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher levels of serum phosphorus and calcium are associated with 
      increased haemodialysis (HD) patient mortality. Both of these factors act 
      synergistically to promote vascular smooth muscle differentiation to an 
      osteoblast-like phenotype and subsequent vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the influence of interdialytic interval on serum levels, as 
      well as the influence of oral calcium-based phosphate binder load on the magnitude 
      of the observed differences. METHODS: We studied 100 patients undergoing HD three 
      times per week, over a 2 week period. Haemoglobin, albumin, calcium and phosphate 
      were measured pre-dialysis before each HD session. Oral phosphate binder usage was 
      recorded. All patients were treated with dialysate containing 1.25 mEq/l calcium. 
      RESULTS: Both mean serum phosphate and calcium were higher after the long 
      interdialytic interval (1.59+/-0.05 vs 1.45+/-0.04 mmol/l, P = 0.0005, and 
      2.46+/-0.03 vs 2.4+/-0.02 mmol/l, P = 0.001, for serum phosphate and uncorrected 
      calcium, respectively). There were no significant differences in haemoglobin or 
      serum albumin, indicating that variable dilution from an increased hydration status 
      in the long interdialytic interval was unlikely to contribute to these observed 
      differences. A total of 74 patients were treated with calcium-containing binders and 
      26 patients with sevelamer. Patients on sevelamer did not exhibit the observed 
      cyclical increase in serum calcium seen in patients on calcium-containing binders 
      (mean difference in serum calcium 0.09+/-0.01 mmol/l in the calcium-treated group vs 
      0.01+/-0.01 mmol/l in the sevelamer-treated patients, P = 0.0004). The increase in 
      serum calcium after the long interval as compared with the short interval was 
      proportional to the daily amount of the oral calcium-containing binder load ingested 
      (r = 0.63, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Cyclical differences in interdialytic interval and 
      overall exposure to both dietary phosphate and oral calcium load influence serum 
      levels. This may have consequences for registry reporting, therapy modulation and 
      potentially the pathogenesis of accelerated vascular calcification seen in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Usefulness of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity measurement: correlation with 
      abdominal aortic calcification.
PG  - 163-7
AB  - At present, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) can be measured easily and 
      noninvasively. We studied the correlation between aortic damage estimated by baPWV 
      and that determined by measuring the length of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      on X-ray films, which parameter has been significantly associated with 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. baPWV was measured using the form PWV/ankle 
      brachial index (ABI) device in 97 patients free of end-stage renal failure or 
      peripheral arterial disease. baPWV correlated significantly with age (r2=0.625, 
      p<0.0001), was significantly higher in hypertensives than in normotensives 
      (2,109+/-67 vs. 1,623+/-93 cm/s, p<0.0001), and correlated significantly with 
      systolic blood pressure (r2=0.64, p<0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (r2=0.397, 
      p<0.0001). baPWV was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetics 
      (2,068+/-73 vs. 1,813+/-97 cm/s, p<0.05), but was similar in normolipidemic and 
      hyperlipidemic patients. baPWV did not correlate with body mass index, fasting 
      plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low 
      density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol or triglyceride levels, but correlated 
      significantly with AAC length (r2=0.599, p<0.0001). Multiple regression analysis 
      indicated that age, systolic blood pressure and AAC length were independent 
      determinants of baPWV. Our results indicate that baPWV is useful for estimating 
      aortic damage and could be a potentially useful predictor of vascular morbidity and 
      mortality.

TI  - Polymorphism in the human matrix Gla protein gene is associated with the progression 
      of vascular calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 882-9
LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0785-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is one of the important proteins inhibiting 
      vascular calcification (VC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the 
      promoter and coding regions of the MGP gene affect the transcriptional activity. In 
      this study, we investigated the relationship between the SNPs and progression of VC 
      in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of 134 MHD patients whose VC could be 
      followed by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) examinations. MGP-SNPs 
      (T-138C, rs1800802 and G-7A, rs1800801) were determined. The progression speed of VC 
      was examined by plotting the abdominal aortic calcium volume scores. RESULTS: The 
      progression speed of VC of patients with the CC genotype of T-138C was significantly 
      slower than that of patients with the CT or TT genotype. Multiple regression 
      analysis showed that CT/TT genotype, greater age at the beginning of MHD, male sex, 
      high levels of calcium × phosphate, low levels of high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of 
      ferritin and non-use of angiotensin II receptor blockers were significantly 
      associated with progression of VC. CONCLUSIONS: The MGP-138CC genotype may be 
      associated with slower progression of VC in MHD patients. The genotype of the MGP 
      gene will be a genomic biomarker that is predictive of VC progression.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of sirolimus-eluting stenting after rotational atherectomy.
PG  - 2042-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of drug-eluting stents after rotational atherectomy (ROTA) 
      has not been clarified. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 704 consecutive patients who 
      underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a sirolimus-eluting stent 
      (SES) (79 with and 625 without ROTA) were enrolled. The 2-year clinical outcome of 
      these patients was compared with that of a group of 1,123 consecutive patients 
      treated with bare-metal stents (BMS) (144 with and 979 without ROTA). At 2 years 
      after index PCI, the use of SES after ROTA was associated with a lower crude 
      incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) than were BMS after ROTA (30.1% vs 
      43.1%, P=0.024). The difference was mainly derived from the reduction in target 
      lesion revascularization (TLR) (25.0% vs 39.1%, P=0.022). After adjusting for 
      confounders, ROTA-SES was associated with a reduction in MACE and TLR, with a 
      similar hazard ratio to the non-ROTA group only with SES implantation. In a subgroup 
      of dialysis patients, the incidence of TLR after ROTA with SES and BMS was similarly 
      high. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SES after ROTA is an appropriate method for selected 
      hard lesions, but has a limited effect in dialysis patients, even after lesion 
      preparation with ROTA.

TI  - Serum cystatin C is associated with early stage coronary atherosclerotic plaque 
      morphology on multidetector computed tomography.
PG  - 350-5
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.06.046 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cystatin C, a novel marker of kidney function, has been reported to be a 
      predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients without established chronic 
      kidney disease. However, the relationship between serum cystatin C concentrations 
      and early stage coronary atherosclerotic plaque morphology among patients with 
      preserved kidney function has not been fully evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: 405 
      outpatients with early coronary artery disease with estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate (eGFR) ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m(2) and <50% stenosis on 64-slice CT coronary 
      angiography were enrolled. Subjects were categorized into quartiles by serum 
      cystatin C (quartile I: ≤ 0.88mg/L - quartile IV: ≥ 1.16mg/L). Plaques in coronary 
      segments were categorized as calcified or noncalcified. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis revealed that lower eGFR, higher age, increasing numbers of noncalcified 
      and calcified plaques, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and female gender 
      were statistically significant predictors of increased cystatin C concentrations. 
      The risk for presence of noncalcified plaques increased significantly with 
      increasing quartiles of cystatin C. Compared with those in the lowest quartile, 
      patients in each subsequent quartile were at steadily increased risk of having 
      noncalcified plaque (quartile IV: OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.3-13.9, p-value <0.001). Both 
      number of segments with calcified plaque and Agatston score were highly correlated 
      with cystatin C concentrations (both p<0.001), but when adjusted for segments with 
      noncalcified plaque and other risk factors, calcified plaque segments were no longer 
      independently predictive. CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C concentrations were 
      correlated with early stage coronary atherosclerotic plaques among patients without 
      established chronic kidney dysfunction. Noncalcified plaques increased with serum 
      cystatin C concentrations, an association independent of eGFR and other 
      cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Lanthanum carbonate delays progression of coronary artery calcification compared 
      with calcium-based phosphate binders in patients on hemodialysis: a pilot study.
PG  - 439-46
LID - 10.1177/1074248413486355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with 
      future cardiovascular events and/or death of patients on hemodialysis (HD). We 
      investigated whether progression of CAC in patients on HD could be delayed by 
      switching from a calcium (Ca)-based phosphate (Pi) binder to lanthanum carbonate. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: The CAC scores were evaluated at 
      study enrollment and after 6 months in 52 patients on HD using calcium carbonate 
      (CC) as a Pi binder. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups assigned to 
      receive either CC or lanthanum carbonate (LC), and the CAC scores were evaluated 
      after a 6-month treatment period. Progression of CAC was assessed, as were serum 
      levels of Ca, Pi, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). RESULTS: Forty-two patients 
      completed the study (23 receiving CC and 19 receiving LC). In the 6 months prior to 
      randomization, all patients were treated with CC. During this 6-month period, the 
      CAC scores increased significantly in all 42 patients. Once randomized, there was 
      significantly less progression in the group treated with LC than with CC. Changes in 
      CAC scores from 6 to 12 months were significantly smaller in the LC group than the 
      CC group (-288.9 ± 1176.4 vs 107.1 ± 559.6, P = .036), and percentage changes were 
      also significantly different (-6.4% vs 41.2%, P = .024). Serum Ca, Pi, and iPTH 
      levels were similar in both groups during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot 
      study suggested that LC delayed progression of CAC in patients on HD compared with 
      CC.

TI  - Effects of age, sex, and polycystic disease on progressive bone disease of renal 
      failure.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - A study of 150 patients undergoing haemodialysis has shown that age had a striking 
      effect on the radiological presentation of renal bone disease, erosions being common 
      in the young and uncommon in older patients and vascular calcification showing 
      opposite trends to this. Men aged 20 to 59 years had a greater tendency to develop 
      erosions than did women in this age range. Examination of a group of 53 patients 
      over a period of five years showed that the half time for the development of 
      vascular calcification was 4.6 years, erosions 26.7 years, and fractures 6.9 years. 
      Nine out of 16 polycystic patients matched for age and sex with 50 controls did not 
      develop erosions and had consistently less vascular calcification than the controls 
      when examined over a six-year period.

TI  - High-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I is elevated in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis, independent of cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the hypothesis that cardiac-specific troponin-I (cTn-I), a 
      biomarker of myocardial injury, is elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
      (RA). BACKGROUND: RA patients have an increased incidence of heart failure (HF). 
      Chronic myocardial injury in RA may be a mechanism for the development of HF. 
      METHODS: We compared cTn-I concentrations measured by high-sensitivity immunoassay 
      in 164 patients with RA and 90 controls, excluding prior or active heart failure. We 
      examined the relationship between cTn-I concentrations and cardiovascular risk 
      factors, inflammation, and coronary artery calcium score (CACS), a measure of 
      coronary atherosclerosis. RESULTS: cTn-I concentrations were 49% higher in patients 
      with RA (median 1.15 pg/mL [IQR 0.73-1.92] than controls (0.77 pg/mL 
      [0.49-1.28](P<0.001). The difference remained statistically significant after 
      adjustment for demographic characteristics (P = 0.002), further adjustment for 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk factors (P = 0.004), inflammatory markers (P = 0.008), and 
      in a comprehensive model of CV risk factors and inflammatory markers (P = 0.03). In 
      patients with RA, cTn-I concentrations were positively correlated with age (rho = 
      0.359), Framingham risk score (FRS) (rho = 0.366), and systolic blood pressure (rho 
      = 0.248 (all P values ≤ 0.001)), but not with measures of inflammation or RA drug 
      therapies. cTn-I was significantly correlated with CACS in RA in univariate 
      analysis, but not after adjustment for age, race, sex and FRS (P = 0.79). Further 
      model adjustments for renal function and coronary artery disease confirmed the 
      significance of the findings. CONCLUSION: High-sensitivity cTn-I concentrations are 
      elevated in patients with RA without heart failure, independent of cardiovascular 
      risk profile and inflammatory markers. Elevated troponin concentrations in RA may 
      indicate subclinical, indolent myocardial injury.

TI  - Effects of lowering dialysate calcium concentrations on arterial stiffness in 
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.
PG  - 320-7
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2011.26.3.320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We assessed changes in hemodynamic and arterial stiffness 
      parameters following reductions of dialysate calcium concentrations in patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this prospective study, 20 patients on 
      maintenance hemodialysis (10 females, 10 males) with dialysate calcium 
      concentrations of 1.75 mmol/L were enrolled. At the start of the study, the 
      dialysate calcium level was lowered to 1.50 mmol/L. Serial changes in biochemical, 
      hemodynamic, and arterial stiffness parameters, including pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
      and augmentation index (AIx), were assessed every 2 months for 6 months. We also 
      examined changes in the calcification-inhibitory protein, serum fetuin-A. RESULTS: 
      During the 6-month study period, serum total calcium and ionized calcium decreased 
      consistently (9.5 ± 1.0 to 9.0 ± 0.7, p = 0.002 vs. 1.3 ± 0.1 to 1.1 ± 0.1, p = 
      0.035). Although no apparent changes in blood pressure were observed, heart-femoral 
      PWW (hf-PWV) and AIx showed significant improvement (p = 0.012, 0.043, 
      respectively). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of lowering 
      dialysate calcium on hf-PWV (F = 4.58, p = 0.004) and AIx (F = 2.55, p = 0.049). 
      Accompanying the change in serum calcium, serum fetuin-A levels significantly 
      increased (95.8 ± 45.8 pmol/mL at baseline to 124.9 ± 82.2 pmol/mL at 6 months, p = 
      0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Lowering dialysate calcium concentration significantly improved 
      arterial stiffness parameters, which may have been associated with upregulation of 
      serum fetuin-A.

TI  - A study on the biological significance of midregion and intact parathyroid hormone 
      in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - In this study, we investigated the relationship between the concentrations of intact 
      parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) and midregion PTH (m-PTH) measured by an 
      immunoradiometric assay and a radioimmunoassay, respectively, versus various 
      demographic and biochemical parameters, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar 
      spine (LS) and radius, and the radiographic findings of osteosclerosis and aortic 
      calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. m-PTH correlated positively and more 
      significantly with serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (P), Ca-P solubility 
      products (Ca x P) and LS-BMD than i-PTH did (P = 0.024 vs. 0.531, 0.001 vs. 0.061, 
      0.0001 vs. 0.125, and 0.017 vs. 0.284, respectively). A positive correlation between 
      the percent changes in serum P over the 1-month measurement period and those in 
      m-PTH rather than in i-PTH was also observed (P = 0.021 vs. 0.869). These data 
      indicate than m-PTH is distinct from i-PTH in its positive correlation with serum 
      Ca, serum P, Ca [symbol: see text] P and LS-BMD in HD patients. Since m-PTH is known 
      to consist mostly of the midregion and carboxyl-terminal fragments of PTH in HD 
      patients, the present study suggests that these PTH fragments may be biologically 
      significant in the patients in vivo.

TI  - Penultimate pulse wave velocity, better than baseline pulse wave velocity, predicted 
      mortality in Italian ESRD cohort study - a case for daily hemodialysis for ESRD 
      patients with accelerated pulse wave velocity changes.
LID - gin/30.2.22 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease remains the major cause of death among ESRD patients. 
      Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular events in ESRD is reported to be at least 3.4 
      fold higher than that of the general population. Moreover, annual mortality rates 
      among ESRD patients on hemodialysis approximate 20%, with cardiovascular disease 
      accounting for almost half of this mortality profile. Despite this knowledge, so far 
      we have been unable to identify treatable pathogenetic factors among ESRD patients 
      to help reverse these poor cardiovascular outcomes. The difficulty to prognosticate 
      cardiovascular mortality in ESRD remains elusive. However, in 2011, our group, for 
      the first time, had demonstrated that cyclic variations of arterial stiffness as 
      measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) before and after hemodialysis determined 
      mortality differences within an ESRD cohort. We have therefore examined the impact 
      of individual patient-level translational PWV changes over time on mortality 
      outcomes in an Italian ESRD cohort. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective 
      observational study, 2007-2010, in an Italian ESRD cohort who underwent in-center 
      outpatient conventional thrice weekly hemodialysis. METHODS: PWV was measured by the 
      foot-to-foot method and repeated after six months. Coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) was measured at 0, 12 and 24 months. Routine clinical data and patient 
      demographics were recorded and mortality outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 
      2007 and 2010, 466 Italian ESRD patients, 229 males and 237 females, age 19-97 
      (65.6) years, were followed up for 28.9 months. 128 patients (74M:54F) died. The 
      major causes of death were acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 47 (37%) patients 
      (age 70, 26M:21F) and sudden death (SD) in 29 (23%) patients (age 72, 19M:10F). 
      Paired PWV data was available in 308 surviving patients and in 106 patients who 
      died. Baseline PWV was lower in surviving vs dead patients 8.46 +/- 1.8 vs 9.43 +/- 
      3.75 (p=0.0005). Repeat PWV values were unchanged in the 308 survivors (8.46 +/- 1.8 
      vs 8.53 +/- 1.85, p=0.5, NS). Repeat PWV values increased in the 106 patients who 
      died from 9.43 +/- 3.75 to 12.11 +/- 4.18 (p<0.0001). Of the 29 patients who died 
      from SD, death occurred <12 hours after the last dialysis (ATLD) in 7, >24 hours 
      ATLD in 20 and >48 hours ATLD in 17. Of the 47 patients who died from AMI, 6 died 
      <12 hours ATLD, 35 died >24 hours ATLD and 23 died >48 hours ATLD. Of the 14 ESRD 
      patients in the cohort that died from hyperkalemia, 3 died <12 hours ATLD, 11 died 
      >24 hours ATLD, and 7 died >48 hours ATLD. CAC data scatter did not allow for 
      adequate statistical subgroup analysis but overall, baseline CAC values were higher 
      in the AMI/SD dead patients vs surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first 
      report to show a scalable and direct relationship between translational follow up 
      PWV changes after six months versus observed cardiovascular mortality in an ESRD 
      cohort. We have shown, for the first time, that penultimate PWV, better than 
      baseline PWV, predicted cardiovascular mortality in this ESRD cohort. Moreover, 
      higher proportions of the ESRD deaths from AMI, SD and hyperkalemia occurred during 
      the long inter-dialytic (weekend) period when ESRD patients went for 3 days without 
      hemodialysis. We propose that PWV be monitored among all new ESRD patients, and be 
      repeated after six months of initiation of chronic hemodialysis. Our group had 
      earlier demonstrated in 2012 that daily dialysis reduced PWV in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients. From these study findings, we have proposed that ESRD patients who exhibit 
      elevated initial PWV values, or more so, ESRD patients who demonstrate accelerated 
      PWV values after six months on maintenance chronic hemodialysis should be converted 
      to daily hemodialysis protocol. Furthermore, such patients may require more intense 
      cardiovascular analysis by cardiologists. Further research into new preventative or 
      therapeutic options in this area of ESRD care is warranted.

TI  - Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis: unusual clinical 
      associations and novel claudin16 mutation in an Egyptian family.
PG  - 288-294
LID - 10.1007/s10157-008-0126-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) 
      is a rare autosomal recessive tubular disorder that eventually progresses to renal 
      failure, depending upon the extent of nephrocalcinosis. Its basic pathogenesis is 
      impaired tubular resorption of magnesium and calcium in the thick ascending limb of 
      the loop of Henle (TAL) due to a genetic defect in paracellin-1 (a tight junction 
      protein expressed in TAL). Mutations of the claudin16 gene (CLDN16), formerly called 
      paracellin-1 gene (PCLN-1), have been linked to FHHNC. METHODS: An extended Egyptian 
      family with more than one member affection by nephrocalcionsis was included and 
      thoroughly investigated in the current study after giving informed consent. Thorough 
      history was taken for polyuria, polydipsia and hypocalcemia symptoms, as well as 
      clinical examination with stress on anthropometric measurements and radiological 
      evaluation for kidneys and bones. Laboratory workup for the differential diagnosis 
      of nephrocalcinosis was done: complete urinalysis, including urinary calcium 
      excretion, urine pH and electrolytes, arterial blood gas (ABG), serum electrolytes 
      (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous), renal function tests as 
      well as parathyroid and gonadotropin-sex hormone assay. DNA extraction from 
      peripheral blood leukocytes was done followed by amplification using primers 
      previously described, purification and finally sequencing to analyze each exon of 
      the CLDN16 gene. RESULTS: Two sibs for a consanguineous couple were affected by 
      nephrocalcinosis and showed persistent hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, 
      nephrocalcinosis with persistently alkaline urine and ocular manifestations in the 
      form of congenital cataracts, high myopia and retinal abnormalities. The elder sib 
      showed genitourinary abnormalities in the form of hypospadias and cryptorchidism. 
      These two sibs had a homozygous two-base deletion in exon 1 of the CLDN16 gene (C. 
      233_234 del GG; Ins C), causing a frame shift mutation (Arg55 fs); however, their 
      parents were heterozygote carriers for that mutation. CONCLUSION: The 
      above-mentioned clinical data in the two affected sibs together with the family 
      history of end-stage renal disease associated with nephrocalcinosis and high myopia 
      suggested a diagnosis of FHHNC, which was confirmed for the first time in an 
      Egyptian family by a novel mutation in exon 1 of the CLDN16 gene. Genitourinary 
      associations with FHHNC have not yet been reported in the literature. Here, we will 
      try to highlight the principles of mutation detection based on sequencing with the 
      use of the online NCBI databases, statistics and other search tools.

TI  - Carpal tunnel syndrome in patients who are receiving long-term renal hemodialysis.
PG  - 1145-53
AB  - In forty-six (9 per cent) of 485 patients who were receiving long-term renal 
      hemodialysis, a carpal tunnel syndrome developed in at least one hand. A total of 
      sixty-four surgical procedures were performed for this problem in forty-one 
      patients. All of the forty-one patients reported symptomatic relief, although three 
      had recurrent symptoms. There was no correlation between the time of onset of the 
      carpal tunnel syndrome and such factors as the patient's age, sex, or race; the 
      cause of renal failure; the site of vascular access for hemodialysis; or a history 
      of parathyroidectomy. There was a correlation, however, between the development of 
      the carpal tunnel syndrome, the side of the longest functional vascular access, and 
      the presence of arterial calcifications. In all eleven patients in whom a radial 
      steal syndrome developed, an ipsilateral carpal-tunnel syndrome also developed. It 
      was concluded that factors other than those involving the site of vascular access 
      must have important etiological roles.

TI  - Histological, radiological, and biochemical features of the adynamic bone lesion in 
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 19-29
AB  - Adynamic bone is being found with increasing frequency in dialysis patients. Little 
      is known about its aetiology, and even less about its natural history. We found 10 
      cases of asymptomatic adynamic bone among a group of 32 continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis patients, most of whom had never been exposed to 
      aluminium-containing phosphate binders. Compared to the remaining 22 patients, they 
      had an older mean age (54 +/- 11.4 vs. 42 +/- 11.8 years; p < 0.05), probably a 
      longer pre-dialysis duration of renal failure (10.9 vs. 7.1 years), higher mean 
      ionized calcium (1.30 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; p < 0.01), and lower mean 
      intact parathyroid hormone (31.5 vs. 200.3 pg/ml; p < 0.001). The bone density was 
      not different between the two groups, but 9 of the 10 adynamic patients had 
      significant vascular calcification seen on plain radiology as compared with only 7 
      of 20 in the comparison group (p < 0.05). Follow-up of the adynamic patients showed 
      a close association with serum intact parathyroid hormone and ionized calcium 
      levels. With one exception, adynamic bone did not appear to be associated with lower 
      bone density than other types of osteodystrophy, but a longer-term study is required 
      to determine the complete natural history of this lesion.

TI  - Course of transplanted cadaver donor kidneys with previously existing pathology.
PG  - 543-71
AB  - Seventeen cases were studied in which the contralateral donor kidney was available 
      for comparison with the transplanted kidney after it was removed from the host 
      following varying periods of survival. The following morphologic observations were 
      made: Arteries exhibiting arteriosclerosis appeared, in the new host, to take on a 
      distinct new cellular deposit which was superimposed on the previously existing 
      hyalinization in the intima. Except for one instance in which the host had secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, calcification in the donor organ did not undergo significant 
      change. In some instances, the lymphocytes which existed in the donor kidney prior 
      to transplantation appeared to undergo proliferation and produce a localized 
      graft-versus-host reaction in the recipient.

TI  - Atherosclerosis of radial and internal thoracic arteries used in coronary bypass: 
      atherosclerosis in arterial grafts.
PG  - 385-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the degree and incidence of atherosclerosis 
      in internal thoracic (ITA) and radial arteries (RA) harvested for coronary bypass 
      grafting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The association of major clinical events and 
      etiological factors for atherosclerosis was investigated in 770 arterial segments 
      obtained prospectively from 480 patients. Potential risk factors for atherosclerosis 
      were age, gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, 
      cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal failure, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, 
      hypertension, and a positive family history. RESULTS: Six types of histological 
      lesions have been defined; grade III or more was present in the RA in 47 (16%) 
      patients and in the ITA in 30 (7%). The mean grade was 1.6 +/- 0.6 in the ITA and 
      2.1 +/- 0.9 in the RA (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RA had a significantly greater 
      prevalence of atherosclerosis than the same patients' ITA. There was a strong 
      correlation between ITA atherosclerosis and age. The presence of calcification may 
      lead surgeons to avoid an extra incision according to risk factors, although most of 
      these are not predictive.

TI  - Differences in Risk Factors and Prevalence of Vascular Calcification between 
      Pre-Dialysis and Hemodialysis Balkan Nephropathy Patients.
LID - 10.3390/medicina54010004 [doi]
LID - 4
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the risk factors and prevalence of 
      vascular calcification (VC) in pre-dialysis and hemodialysis (HD) patients with 
      Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) or other kidney diseases (non-BEN). Materials and 
      Methods: The study involved 115 patients, 32 pre-dialysis and 83 HD patients, 
      separated into groups of BEN and non-BEN patients. In addition to interviews, 
      objective examinations and laboratory analyses, VC was assessed using Adragao score. 
      Results: Patients with BEN were significantly older in both groups, while 
      pre-dialysis BEN patients had significantly lower systolic blood pressure, serum 
      cholesterol and phosphorus levels, but higher urinary excretion of phosphorus than 
      non-BEN patients. These differences were lost in HD groups. In pre-dialysis 
      patients, prevalence of VC was lower in BEN than in non-BEN group and mean VC score 
      differed significantly between them (2.8 (1.7) vs. 4.6 (1.8); p = 0.009). No 
      significant difference in VC score was found between BEN and non-BEN patients on HD. 
      Multivariate analysis showed that in pre-dialysis patients VC score >4 was 
      associated with lower iPTH and higher serum cholesterol level, but in the HD group 
      with higher serum triglyceride level and longer HD vintage. Conclusions: Lower 
      prevalence of risk factors for VC in the BEN than non-BEN patients was found in 
      pre-dialysis but not in HD group and this was reflected in the prevalence and 
      severity of VC in the groups. Prevalence of VC and mean VC score were significantly 
      lower in pre-dialysis BEN than in non-BEN patients but not for those on HD.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and chronically decreased GFR in living kidney donors.
PG  - 143-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the presence of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the risk 
      of morbidity and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased 
      markedly. Increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) is proposed as a 
      pathogenetic link between CVD and chronic kidney disease. We examined the frequency 
      and severity of CAC in living kidney donors to test the hypothesis that decreased 
      GFR is associated with increased CAC. METHODS: We used multidetector spiral computed 
      tomography to examine CAC in 101 living kidney donors and 99 age- and sex-matched 
      healthy control subjects without diabetes and a history of coronary artery disease. 
      The extent of calcification was measured by means of the Agatston score. GFR was 
      calculated by using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. 
      The frequency of risk factors for coronary artery disease was compared in kidney 
      donors and controls, and the relation between kidney donors' clinical 
      characteristics and the presence or absence of CAC was examined. RESULTS: CAC 
      frequency and mean calcification scores were similar between kidney donors (13.9%; 
      4.5 +/- 22.6) and controls (17.2%; 13.2 +/- 89.2). CAC was not associated with 
      decreased GFR, and the correlation between CAC and GFR was not statistically 
      significant. Kidney donors with calcification were more likely to be older (P = 
      0.003) and male (P = 0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted analysis showed an association 
      between greater parathormone levels (odds ratio, 1.023; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.001 to 1.045; P = 0.037) and CAC in kidney donors. CONCLUSION: A mild decrease in 
      GFR without the presence of diabetes does not seem to be associated with increased 
      CAC. These findings need to be confirmed in different and larger study populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients (HD) display high rates of cardiac disease and 
      mortality. The cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of HD patients is attributable 
      in a significant proportion to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and 
      vascular calcifications. AIM: To measure vascular reactivity in HD subjects and 
      compare them with healthy volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty eight non diabetic 
      patients aged 58 ± 4.6 years (29 males) on hemodialysis for a mean lapse of 4.8 
      years were studied. Arterial stiffness was measured in the radial artery. Pulse wave 
      velocity was measured by noninvasive peripheral arterial tonometry in carotid and 
      femoral arteries. Endothelial function was assessed, measuring reactive hyperemia 
      response after a 5 min period of ischemia. As a control, all values were also 
      measured in age and gender-matched healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Arterial stiffness 
      was significantly higher in HD patients than controls (23.9 ± 3.3 and 18.4 ± 3.4% 
      respectively, p < 0.05). HD subjects had an increased pulse wave velocity (10.0 ± 
      0.8 and 7.6 ± 0.9 m/s respectively, p < 0.05). A reduction in the change in pulse 
      amplitude pressure, as a measure of arterial dysfunction, was only observed in male 
      patients (1.7 ± 0.4 and 2.7 ± 0.4 respectively p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive 
      assessment of peripheral vascular function may be useful for the identification of 
      patients at risk for late cardiac events.

PG  - 636-44
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.11.037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular disease 
      burden in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that 
      bisphosphonate therapy would reduce the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events 
      in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: Adult women with stage 3 or 4 CKD receiving primary care in a large 
      rural integrated health care system in 2004-2010. EXPOSURE: Time-dependent exposure 
      status based on outpatient prescription for any medication within the bisphosphonate 
      class, obtained from electronic health records. OUTCOMES: Time to death and first 
      cardiovascular event (composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke). 
      RESULTS: Data from 9,604 eligible female patients with CKD were analyzed; 3,234 were 
      treated with bisphosphonate therapy. During a median follow-up of 3.9 (25th-75th 
      percentile, 2.3-5.4) years, there were 286 versus 881 deaths and 206 versus 571 
      cardiovascular events (treated vs not-treated groups, respectively). In a 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR for death (treated vs 
      not treated) was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91; P = 0.003). In Cox modeling adjusted for 
      similar baseline covariates, treatment with bisphosphonates was not associated with 
      a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 
      0.94-1.39; P = 0.2). LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding by unidentified factors, 
      exclusion of male patients, and lack of information about longitudinal drug 
      adherence. CONCLUSIONS: For female patients with CKD, treatment with bisphosphonates 
      is associated with a lower risk of death, but not cardiovascular events. 
      Confirmatory studies and investigations of potential causal mechanisms are 
      warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a risk factor for 
      the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the possibility of 
      postoperative deterioration of renal function must be considered before surgery. We 
      investigated the contribution of the aortic calcification index (ACI) to the 
      prediction of deterioration of renal function in patients undergoing radical 
      nephrectomy. METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2012, we performed 511 
      consecutive radical nephrectomies for patients with RCC. We retrospectively studied 
      data from 109 patients who had regular postoperative follow-up of renal function for 
      at least five years. The patients were divided into non-CKD and pre-CKD based on a 
      preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. The ACI was quantitatively measured by abdominal 
      computed tomography before surgery. The patients in each group were stratified 
      between low and high ACIs. Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, and pre- and 
      postoperative renal function were compared between patients with a low or high ACI 
      in each group. Renal function deterioration-free interval rates were evaluated by 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. Factors independently associated with deterioration of renal 
      function were determined using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age, 
      preoperative eGFR, and ACI in this cohort were 65 years, 68 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 
      8.3%, respectively. Higher ACI (≥8.3%) was significantly associated with eGFR 
      decline in both non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Renal function deterioration-free 
      interval rates were significantly lower in the ACI-high than ACI-low strata in both 
      of the non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher ACI was 
      an independent risk factor for deterioration of renal function at 5 years after 
      radical nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic calcification burden is a potential 
      predictor of deterioration of renal function after radical nephrectomy. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN000023577.

PG  - 945-51
LID - 10.1007/s00467-011-1822-0 [doi]
AB  - Increased mortality of adult chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients is associated with 
      coronary calcifications (CC), increased serum phosphorus (P), use of calcium 
      (Ca)-containing P-binders, and vitamin D deficiency. Serum concentration of 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) is markedly elevated in adults receiving 
      dialysis and is independently associated with increased mortality. Although coronary 
      calcifications have been described in pediatric and adult HD patients, no 
      significant association between serum FGF 23 and CC has been reported. In our study, 
      5/16 patients had CC. Patients with CC were older, had longer dialysis vintage and 
      higher serum P. Serum Ca, total PTH, elemental Ca intake, and calcitriol doses were 
      not different for CC patients. Serum FGF 23 levels were markedly elevated in all 
      patients (mean 4,024, range 874-8,253), but significantly higher in patients with CC 
      (4,247 ± 10,35 vs 2,427 ± 11,92, p = 0.01) and positively correlated with Agatston 
      calcification score (r = 0.69, p = 0.003) and serum P (r = 0.49, p = 0.05). Using 
      multivariate analysis, serum FGF 23 and serum P remained the most significant 
      factors associated with Agatston score. This study confirms the occurrence of CC in 
      pediatric HD patients and is the first to show a significant association between CC 
      and elevated serum FGF 23 in children.

AB  - AIMS: The association of coronary arterial calcification with cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality is well-recognized. Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) 
      is common in PAD but its impact on subsequent health is poorly described. We aimed 
      to determine the association between a LLAC score and subsequent cardiovascular 
      events in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). METHODS: LLAC 
      scoring, and the established Bollinger score, were derived from a database of 
      unenhanced CT scans, from patients presenting with symptomatic PAD. We determined 
      the association between these scores outcomes. The primary outcome was combined 
      cardiac mortality and morbidity (CM/M) with a secondary outcome of all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: 220 patients (66% male; median age 69 years) were included with 
      follow-up for a median 46 [IQR 31-64] months. Median total LLAC scores were higher 
      in those patients suffering a primary outcome (6831 vs. 1652; p = 0.012). Diabetes 
      mellitus (p = 0.039), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.028), chronic kidney disease (p 
      = 0.026) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.012) were more common in patients in the 
      highest quartile of LLAC scores. The area under the curve of the receiver operator 
      curve for the LLAC score was greater (0.929: 95% CI [0.884-0.974]) than for the 
      Bollinger score (0.824: 95% CI [0.758-0.890]) for the primary outcome. A LLAC score 
      ≥ 4400 had the best diagnostic accuracy to determine the outcome measure. 
      CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to investigate links between lower limb 
      arterial calcification and cardiovascular events in symptomatic PAD. We describe a 
      straightforward, reproducible, CT-derived measure of calcification-the LLAC score.

TI  - The effect of immunosuppressive treatment on arterial stiffness and matrix Gla 
      protein levels in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 491-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In this 
      study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian 
      Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal transplant 
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or 
      mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial 
      stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, 
      Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein (MGP) 
      concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). 
      RESULTS: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. Mean 
      age was 37.9 ± 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were female. Age, gender, graft 
      functions and follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index was 
      15.2 ± 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 ± 14.0% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There was no 
      difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between groups. Arterial 
      stiffness was positively correlated with age, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria. MGP levels were higher in the mTORi 
      group but were not predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSION: 
      Rather than specific immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional risk factors, 
      blood pressure and proteinuria are the most important predictors for arterial 
      stiffness in renal transplant patients.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 exacerbate arterial stiffening and angiogenesis in 
      diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 494-504
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvp242 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are the prominent risk factors of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 regulate 
      vascular structure by degrading elastic fibre and inhibit angiogenesis by generating 
      angiostatin. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and -9 were up-regulated in the arterial 
      vasculature from CKD patients with diabetes, compared with those without diabetes. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: During living donor transplantation procedures, arteries from 
      donors (n = 8) and recipients (non-diabetic, n = 8; diabetic, n = 8; matched in age, 
      gender, and dialysis treatments) were harvested. Diabetic arteries had increased 
      MMP-2 and -9 activities by 42 and 116% compared with non-diabetic ones. Diabetic 
      arteries were the stiffest, and the stiffness measurement was highly correlated with 
      the summation of MMP-2 + MMP-9 activities (r = 0.738, P = 0.0002). Pulse wave 
      velocity measurements correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.683, P = 0.005). Elastic 
      fibre degradation and calcification were worst in diabetic vessels. The phosphate 
      level, which was 25% higher in diabetic patients, correlated with MMP activity (r = 
      0.513, P = 0.04) and in vitro stiffness (r = 0.545, P = 0.03), respectively. 
      Angiostatin expression was doubled, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was 
      50% reduced in diabetic compared with non-diabetic vessels. Microvascular density in 
      diabetic vessels was 48% of that in non-diabetic ones, and it was strongly 
      associated with MMP activity (r = -0.792, P < 0.0001) and vasorelaxation (r = 0.685, 
      P = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: Using a matched case-control design, we report 
      up-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 in diabetic CKD arteries and correlate those with 
      stiffening, impaired angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings may 
      help to explain the high susceptibility of CVD in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Reducing the burden of cardiovascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - S95-102
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher burden of atherosclerotic 
      coronary artery disease compared with age- and gender-matched individuals with 
      normal renal function. Cardiovascular calcification (CVC), a marker of 
      atherosclerosis, is also more prevalent in these patients and is associated with 
      serious clinical consequences. The pathogenesis of CVC is complex and includes 
      factors that promote calcification and others that inhibit calcification. Thus, 
      multiple therapeutic interventions should be used simultaneously to reduce the 
      burden of calcification in patients with CKD. Thus far, interventional attempts have 
      focused on curtailing the effects of factors that promote calcification such as 
      management of known traditional factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease 
      and on adopting specific approaches to normalize mineral metabolism, deliver 
      adequate dialysis, and control serum cholesterol level. By contrast, interventions 
      that may bolster the effects of inhibitors of calcification have not yet been 
      studied well but are beginning to attract attention. Ideally, the goal of 
      interventions is not only to slow or halt progression of calcification but also to 
      reverse pre-existing calcification. Whether this goal is achievable is not currently 
      known. This review examines the potential of various therapeutic interventions in 
      reducing the CVC burden in patients with CKD. Moreover, the review is intended to 
      stimulate more research in this area because the efficacy of these interventions has 
      not been examined in controlled clinical trials.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with 
      the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients with type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 consecutive T1D patients without 
      coronary artery disease, with at least 5 years of diabetes and absence of end-stage 
      renal disease. Mean age was 38 ± 10 years and 57% were males. CAC score was measured 
      by multidetector computed tomography (Siemens Sensation 64 Cardiac). The insulin 
      resistance index was measured using the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR). The 
      eGDR was lower among CAC-positive patients than among CAC-negative patients, 
      suggesting an increased insulin resistance. In a logistic regression model adjusted 
      for age (at 10-year intervals), eGDR, diabetic nephropathy and gender, CAC was 
      associated with age [OR = 2.73 (95%CI = 1.53-4.86), P = 0.001] and with eGDR [OR = 
      0.08 (95%CI = 0.02-0.21), P = 0.004]. In T1D subjects, insulin resistance is one of 
      the most important risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis.

TI  - Impact of lesion calcification on clinical and angiographic outcome after 
      sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in real-world patients.
PG  - 2-8
LID - 10.1016/j.carrev.2007.07.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated similar efficacy of the drug-eluting 
      stent (DES) in patients with and without calcified lesions. However, most of the 
      randomized trials have excluded patients with severe calcified lesions. This study 
      aimed to examine the impact of lesion calcium on clinical and angiographic outcome 
      after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in real-world patients. METHODS: 
      Consecutive 380 patients with 556 lesions treated with SES were enrolled. Lesions 
      were divided into Calc lesions (moderate or sever calcification; 195 lesions) and 
      non-Calc lesions (none or mild calcification; 361 lesions) according to the lesion 
      calcium. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) parameters, binary restenosis rate 
      (%restenosis), target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate, and major adverse cardiac 
      events (MACE) during follow-up were compared between the two groups. All patients 
      were contacted at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure. RESULTS: Lesion success 
      rate was similar in the two groups. %Restenosis (9.2% vs. 3.6%; P<.05) and TLR (7.3% 
      vs. 2.8%; P<.05) were significantly higher in Calc lesions. Stent thrombosis was 
      observed in 0.7% of overall lesions with no difference between the two groups. The 
      MACE rate in Calc patients (13.8%) was significantly higher than in non-Calc 
      patients (6.1%). By multivariate analysis, hemodialysis (HD) and requirement of 
      rotational atherectomy (RA) were predictive factors of TLR in the Calc lesions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary lesions with calcification comprise a high-risk cohort and are 
      associated with a higher TLR and binary restenosis rates in real-world patients 
      treated with SES. Moreover, patients with calcified lesions and on HD are associated 
      with higher MACE rate.

TI  - Correlates of osteoprotegerin and association with aortic pulse wave velocity in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2612-9
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03910411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
      resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and 
      stiffness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured in 
      351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic 
      Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured 
      by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression 
      was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave 
      velocity. RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female 
      gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was 
      not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum 
      phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with 
      concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for 
      demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors 
      such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, 
      presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or 
      after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness 
      independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation.

TI  - Peripheral vascular calcification in long-haemodialysis patients: associated factors 
      and survival consequences.
PG  - 948-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with 
      numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension 
      and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD 
      patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of 
      sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and 
      effects on the 1-year survival rate. METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre 
      using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and 
      extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to 
      their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological 
      data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, 
      beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year 
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the 
      centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects 
      were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 
      months (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l 
      dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients 
      were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were 
      classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, 
      more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 
      'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and 
      low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
      FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a 
      score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to 
      patients with a 0 score. CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high 
      prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis 
      strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic 
      factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure 
      and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association 
      with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The 
      harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and 
      optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD 
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether magnesium intake is 
      associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC). BACKGROUND: Animal and cell studies suggest that magnesium may 
      prevent calcification within atherosclerotic plaques underlying cardiovascular 
      disease. Little is known about the association of magnesium intake and 
      atherosclerotic calcification in humans. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional 
      associations of self-reported total (dietary and supplemental) magnesium intake 
      estimated by food frequency questionnaire with CAC and AAC in participants of the 
      Framingham Heart Study who were free of cardiovascular disease and underwent 
      Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the heart and abdomen (n = 2,695; age: 
      53 ± 11 years), using multivariate-adjusted Tobit regression. CAC and AAC were 
      quantified using modified Agatston scores (AS). Models were adjusted for age, sex, 
      body mass index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 
      total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, use of hormone replacement 
      therapy (women only), menopausal status (women only), treatment for hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension, cardiovascular disease prevention, or diabetes, as well as 
      self-reported intake of calcium, vitamins D and K, saturated fat, fiber, alcohol, 
      and energy. Secondary analyses included logistic regressions of CAC and AAC outcomes 
      as cut-points (AS >0 and AS ≥90th percentile for age and sex), as well as 
      sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, a 50-mg/day increment in 
      self-reported total magnesium intake was associated with 22% lower CAC (p < 0.001) 
      and 12% lower AAC (p = 0.07). Consistent with these observations, the odds of having 
      any CAC were 58% lower (p trend: <0.001) and any AAC were 34% lower (p trend: 0.01), 
      in those with the highest compared to those with the lowest magnesium intake. 
      Stronger inverse associations were observed in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      community-dwelling participants free of cardiovascular disease, self-reported 
      magnesium intake was inversely associated with arterial calcification, which may 
      play a contributing role in magnesium's protective associations in stroke and fatal 
      coronary heart disease.

TI  - The effects of rhBMP-2 and Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients 
      with cardiovascular complication after maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 464-72
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000217 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the correlation of regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17 cell 
      function disequilibrium with calcification in uremic patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) with healthy controls, and investigated if their influence 
      possibly increased the development and outcome of cardiovascular complications in 
      uremic patients after MHD. METHODS: The extent of coronary artery calcification was 
      assessed by coronary artery calcification scoring (CACS) in uremic patients with and 
      without adverse cardiovascular events after MHD (MHD group 1 vs. MHD group 2, 
      respectively). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with rhBMP-2 as 
      positive control. The Treg/Th17 cell frequencies, Foxp3 ROR-gt mRNA expressions, and 
      MIP 3α/CCL20 concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The CACS score was significantly 
      higher in MHD group 1 as compared group 2. In comparison with controls, rhBMP-2 
      upregulates Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients, displayed higher 
      Treg and Th17 frequencies, Foxp3 and ROR-gt expressions, and MIP3α/CCL20 
      concentrations. However, the up-regulations of Treg frequencies and Foxp3 
      expressions were significant in controls but not in MHD patients. It was also 
      observed that Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium was not only correlated with 
      rhBMP-2 state but also consistent with the cardiovascular complications. Moreover, 
      the CACS was negatively correlated with Treg cell frequencies but positively 
      correlated with Th17 cell frequencies and MIP3a/CCL20 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Function disequilibrium of Treg/Th17 was related to the degree of the rhBMP-2 state. 
      Function disequilibrium of the Treg/Th17 might act synergistically with rhBMP-2 in 
      the high incidence of immune-mediated cardiovascular complications after MHD.

PG  - 265-72
LID - 10.1111/j.1492-7535.2004.01104.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification has been associated with all cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). Whether 
      vascular calcification is present in persons with advanced chronic kidney disease 
      starting dialysis or develops in patients on dialysis is unknown. The purpose of 
      this study was to examine the prevalence of vascular and coronary calcification in 
      patients new to hemodialysis. METHODS: A total of 129 subjects new to dialysis were 
      evaluated using electron beam computed tomography. The primary outcome was the 
      presence and extent of coronary artery, aortic, and valvular calcification. RESULTS: 
      Forty-three percent of subjects had no significant coronary artery calcification 
      (total score </= 30) and 27% had no detectable aortic calcification. Thirty-four 
      percent had coronary artery scores that placed them above the 90th percentile for 
      age and sex. Coronary artery calcification was significantly associated with a 
      history of coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) 
      whereas aortic calcification was significantly associated with ASVD. Age (p < 
      0.0001), pulse pressure (p = 0.004), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.009), and a history of 
      smoking (p = 0.026) were independently associated with the extent of coronary artery 
      calcification. Age (p < 0.0001) and pulse pressure (p = 0.0003) were independently 
      associated with the extent of aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: A large fraction of 
      patients new to hemodialysis had no evidence of coronary artery or aortic 
      calcification. Coupled with the extensive vascular calcification reported by others 
      in prevalent dialysis patients these findings suggest that dialysis-specific factors 
      contribute to calcific vascular disease in ESRD.

TI  - [Cardiac failure and diastolic disfunction in hemodialysis patients: associated 
      factors].
PG  - 668-77
AB  - Heart failure (CHF) and diastolic dysfuction (DD) relationship has received poor 
      attention in hemodialysis patients (HD). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of CHF 
      in our HD patients, the relationship with DD and impact on mortality. METHODS: We 
      studied 79 patients: 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. Vascular 
      calcification (PVC) was evaluated by radiologic series (55.7%). We analyzed the 
      presence of clinical and analytical cardiovascular factors. All patients underwent 
      M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two 
      years. Clinical information collected: incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), 
      CHF, and mortality due to cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Most frequent finding was 
      Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) (93%), followed by DD (63.5% had anormal LV 
      relaxation) (ALVR). Incidence of CHF was 38.3%; and was significantly associated 
      with higher: time on HD (130/72 months), Ca x P (74/65), PTH (677/376), bone 
      alkaline phosphatase (27/16), and systolic BP (145 vs 130 mmHg); IHD, PVC, valvular 
      calcification (VC), LVH and ALVR (p < 0.01). Systolic function was normal in both 
      groups (with/without CHF). Logistic regression identified as risk factors for CHF: 
      ALVR (OR: 9.5), IHD (OR: 15) and systolic BP (OR: 2.2). ALVR was associated with 
      greater age (55/37), longer time on HD (76/60), PVC and VC (p < 0.001). Predictor 
      factors identified were age (OR: 2.13) and PVC (OR: 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: HD patients 
      showed a high incidence of CHF. IHD, systolic BP and DD (ALVR) have behave as risk 
      factors for CHF. Vascular calcifications were intimately related to these findings 
      and, therefore, they contribute to the greater mortality of these patients.

TI  - Sevelamer attenuates the progression of coronary and aortic calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is frequent and severe in patients with end-stage 
      renal disease. Disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute by promoting 
      cardiovascular calcification. METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial 
      comparing sevelamer, a non-absorbed polymer, with calcium-based phosphate binders in 
      200 hemodialysis patients. Study outcomes included the targeted concentrations of 
      serum phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcification 
      of the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta using a calcification score derived from 
      electron beam tomography. RESULTS: Sevelamer and calcium provided equivalent control 
      of serum phosphorus (end-of-study values 5.1 +/- 1.2 and 5.1 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, 
      respectively, P = 0.33). Serum calcium concentration was significantly higher in the 
      calcium-treated group (P = 0.002), and hypercalcemia was more common (16% vs. 5% 
      with sevelamer, P = 0.04). More subjects in the calcium group had end-of-study 
      intact PTH below the target of 150 to 300 pg/mL (57% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). At study 
      completion, the median absolute calcium score in the coronary arteries and aorta 
      increased significantly in the calcium treated subjects but not in the 
      sevelamer-treated subjects (coronary arteries 36.6 vs. 0, P = 0.03 and aorta 75.1 
      vs. 0, P = 0.01, respectively). The median percent change in coronary artery (25% 
      vs. 6%, P = 0.02) and aortic (28% vs. 5%, P = 0.02) calcium score also was 
      significantly greater with calcium than with sevelamer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 
      calcium-based phosphate binders, sevelamer is less likely to cause hypercalcemia, 
      low levels of PTH, and progressive coronary and aortic calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Calcitriol and FGF-23, but neither PTH nor sclerostin, are associated with calciuria 
      in CKD.
PG  - 1823-1829
LID - 10.1007/s11255-019-02215-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The recent observation that urinary calcium excretion (UCE) drops 
      considerably with CKD and that this effect may occur beyond compensation for reduced 
      intestinal calcium absorption suggests that CKD per se is a state of sustained 
      positive calcium balance, a mechanism likely to contribute to vascular calcification 
      and CVD in CKD. However, the determinants of UCE reduction in CKD are not well 
      understood and there is a lack of clinical studies, particularly in the CKD 
      population. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate variables associated with 
      UCE in a CKD cohort. METHODS: Baseline data on 356 participants of the Progredir 
      Study, Sao Paulo, Brazil, essentially composed of CKD G3a-G4, were analyzed 
      according to UCE (24 h urine collection). RESULTS: Median 24 h UCE was 38 mg/day 
      (IQR 21-68 mg/day) and 0.48 mg/kg/day (IQR 0.28-0.82 mg/kg/day). In univariate 
      analysis, UCE was inversely related to age, phosphorus, 1-84 PTH, FGF-23 and 
      sclerostin, and positively associated with eGFR, DBP, 1,25(OH)(2-)vitamin D, 
      calcium, bicarbonate, total calorie intake and spironolactone use. After adjustments 
      for age, sex and eGFR, only 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, FGF-23, bicarbonate and 
      total calorie intake remained associated with it, but not PTH nor sclerostin. 
      Lastly, in a multivariable model, eGFR, serum 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, and 
      FGF-23 remained associated with UCE. Similar results were observed when calcium 
      fractional excretion was used instead of UCE, with eGFR, 1-25-vitamin D and FGF-23 
      remaining as independent associations. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CKD is 
      associated with very low levels of UCE and that 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, serum calcium 
      and FGF-23 were independently associated with UCE in this population, raising the 
      question whether these factors are modulators of the tubular handling of calcium in 
      CKD.

TI  - Higher serum sclerostin levels and insufficiency of vitamin D are strongly 
      associated with vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients: a case control study.
PG  - 577-584

AB  - In hemodialysis patients, vertebral fractures were associated with elevated 
      sclerostin levels, suggesting that sclerostin could reflect bone fragility in these 
      patients. INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are common in hemodialysis patients. The 
      aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of vertebral fracture and analyze 
      associations between sclerostin serum levels and vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: Ninety-two hemodialysis patients and 100 controls matched for age 
      and sex were studied. Bone mineral density was measured by ultrasonography at 
      non-dominant heel. The markers of bone turnover included serum osteocalcin, 
      C-terminal telopeptide, and sclerostin. All participants underwent radiography of 
      the thoracic and lumbar spine to ascertain the presence of vertebral fractures. 
      RESULTS: Bone ultrasound parameters at calcaneus were significantly lower in 
      hemodialysis patients compared with controls; bone turnover markers and parathyroid 
      hormone level were significantly higher, while serum of 25-OH-D3 was significantly 
      lower in hemodialysis group. One or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures were 
      found in 38 hemodialysis patients, whereas in control group, 10 patients had a 
      vertebral fracture. In hemodialysis group, the comparison between patients with and 
      without vertebral fractures showed that the patients with vertebral fractures had 
      the serum sclerostin levels statistically higher than patients without vertebral, 
      while serum levels of 25-OH-D3 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral 
      fractures compared to the patients without vertebral fractures. Multivariate 
      analysis disclosed that sclerostin levels were associated with an increased risk of 
      vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients after adjusting for multiple variables. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows high prevalence of vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients and that it is associated with elevated sclerostin levels, reflecting bone 
      fragility in these patients.

TI  - Arterial Stiffness in Hypertension and Function of Large Arteries.
PG  - 291-296
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpz193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness-typically assessed from non-invasive measurement of 
      pulse wave velocity along a straight portion of the vascular tree between the right 
      common carotid and femoral arteries-is a reliable predictor of cardiovascular risk 
      in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: We reviewed how carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity increases with age and is significantly higher in hypertension 
      (than in age- and gender-matched individuals without hypertension), particularly 
      when hypertension is associated with diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: From the elastic 
      aorta to the muscular peripheral arteries of young healthy individuals, there is a 
      gradual but significant increase in stiffness, with a specific gradient. This 
      moderates the transmission of pulsatile pressure towards the periphery, thus 
      protecting the microcirculatory network. The heterogeneity of stiffness between the 
      elastic and muscular arteries causes the gradient to disappear or be inversed with 
      aging, particularly in long-standing hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: In hypertension 
      therefore, pulsatile pressure transmission to the microcirculation is augmented, 
      increasing the potential risk of damage to the brain, the heart, and the kidney. 
      Furthermore, elevated pulse pressure exacerbates end-stage renal disease, 
      particularly in older hypertensive individuals. With increasing age, the elastin 
      content of vessel walls declines throughout the arterial network, and arterial 
      stiffening increases further due to the presence of rigid wall material such as 
      collagen, but also fibronectin, proteoglycans, and vascular calcification. Certain 
      genes, mainly related to angiotensin and/or aldosterone, affect this aging process 
      and contribute to the extent of arterial stiffness, which can independently affect 
      both forward and reflected pressure waves.

TI  - Relationship between serum pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin and 
      atherosclerotic parameters in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 31-5
LID - 10.1159/000148648 [doi]
AB  - Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)/visfatin is produced by adipose tissue, 
      skeletal muscle, bone marrow, the liver and lymphocytes. Although serum 
      PBEF/visfatin is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and its level is 
      elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, it remains unclear whether 
      increased PBEF/visfatin is associated with atherosclerotic parameters in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we measured serum PBEF/visfatin in 68 
      chronic HD patients (age 66 +/- 14 years, time on HD 76 +/- 76 months, 41 males, 27 
      females) and examined the association of serum PBEF/visfatin with serum asymmetric 
      dimethylarginine, arteriosclerotic parameters such as pulse wave velocity, ankle 
      brachial pressure index and the percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification in a 
      cross-sectional fashion. Serum PBEF/visfatin was significantly correlated with time 
      on HD (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), but not with age, gender and diabetes. There was no 
      association between PBEF/visfatin and body mass index, abdominal visceral and 
      subcutaneous fat mass area, and total adiponectin. Serum PBEF/visfatin was 
      significantly positively correlated with log-transformed highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) but negatively with serum albumin (r = -0.33, p < 
      0.01). In contrast, there was no association between serum PBEF/visfatin and 
      asymmetric dimethylarginine, aortic pulse wave velocity, brachial ankle pressure 
      index and percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification. It follows from these 
      findings that serum PBEF/visfatin may reflect the inflammatory status rather than 
      atherosclerotic changes in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Exercise behavior of degenerative mitral stenosis.
PG  - 1845-1853
LID - 10.1007/s10554-020-01898-2 [doi]
AB  - Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is increasingly encountered, particularly among 
      the elderly and those with chronic kidney disease, and is often associated with a 
      transvalvular gradient. In contrast to rheumatic mitral stenosis relatively little 
      is known about mitral stenosis due to MAC. We aimed to clarify whether exercise 
      limitation in this group is primarily due to valvular obstruction or ventricular 
      dysfunction resulting from multiple comorbidities. 20 patients with severe MAC 
      (bulky calcium deposits which restricted leaflet motion) were submitted to supine 
      bicycle exercise, measuring Doppler and echocardiographic parameters at baseline and 
      during exercise. They were compared 1:1 to subjects matched for age, sex, and left 
      ventricular wall thickness. At baseline MAC subjects had higher mean mitral valve 
      gradients (MVG) than comparison subjects (7.5 ± 3.8 vs 1.6 ± 0.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), 
      along with larger indexed left atrial volumes (54.4 ± 14.9 vs 34.0 ± 11.7 mL, 
      p < 0.0001) and reduced left atrial strains (reservoir, conduit, and booster pump). 
      With exercise MAC subjects reached higher levels of MVG (17.3 ± 8.4 vs 5.5 ± 2.5 mm 
      Hg, p < 0.0001), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (estimated from tricuspid 
      regurgitant jet [TR] velocity) and displayed a moderate correlation between ΔMVG and 
      ΔTR velocity (r(2) = 0.57). MAC subjects whose exercise MVG was ≥ 15 mm Hg all had a 
      peak pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 60 mm Hg. MAC subjects also had relative 
      chronotropic incompetence. Patients with severe MAC and a transvalvular gradient 
      experience large increases in MVG and pulmonary pressure with exercise, similar to 
      what has been described in rheumatic mitral stenosis. MAC may be an under-recognized 
      cause of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in older patients.

TI  - Vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 4183-6
AB  - The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include 
      duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, 
      hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was 
      performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis 
      population. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent 
      plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or 
      negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 
      calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients 
      (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for 
      duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = 
      .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or 
      iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not 
      different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to 
      NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = 
      .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, 
      P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the 
      duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular 
      calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other 
      factors in patients with longer dialysis.

TI  - The association between cardiac valvular calcification and fetuin-A levels in kidney 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 1250-1256
LID - 10.1007/s10157-019-01761-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low fetuin-A levels in hemodialysis patients can be associated with 
      development of vascular and valvular calcifications. The mechanisms underlying 
      vascular and valvular calcifications are multifactorial. There are a few studies 
      showing the relationship between low fetuin-A levels and valvular calcification 
      after kidney transplantation. We aimed to evaluate the association between serum 
      fetuin-A levels and valvular calcification in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: 
      The cardiac valvular calcification was assessed by echocardiography in 56 
      recipients. Patients were divided into two groups as those with (n = 11) and without 
      (n = 45) aortic and/or mitral valve calcification. The extent of valvular 
      calcification was visually assessed according to the standard visual score method: 
      moderately (multiple larger spots) and heavily calcified (extensive thickening and 
      calcification) of all cusps. Serum fetuin-A levels were measured. RESULTS: The 
      demographic features of both groups were comparable. There was no significant 
      difference between regular physical exercise (63.6% vs. 55.6%), obesity (18.2% vs. 
      17.8%), abdominal obesity (54.5% vs. 46.7%), smoking (0% vs. 13.3%), hypertension 
      (63.6% vs. 68.9%), left ventricular hypertrophy (45.5% vs. 33.3%) and diabetes 
      mellitus (9.1% vs. 20%) ratios in groups with or without valvular calcification, 
      respectively (p > 0.05). Fetuin-A levels of both groups did not differ. Fetuin-A 
      levels positively correlated with serum creatinine (r 0.326, p = 0.014), and 
      negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r - 0.297, 
      p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: We could not find a relationship between serum fetuin-A 
      levels and valvular calcification in kidney recipients. In this population, further 
      studies are needed to assess the role of serum fetuin-A in valvular calcification.

TI  - Mineral and bone disorders, morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal failure 
      patients on chronic dialysis.
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.15386/cjmed-515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In spite of numerous interventions, the control of mineral 
      disturbances remains poor in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Chronic kidney 
      disease - mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) represent an important cause of 
      mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship 
      between mineral and bone disorders (MBD) and their components impact on all-cause 
      mortality and cardiovascular (CDV) mortality and morbidity in chronic dialysis 
      patients. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in a cohort of 92 randomly 
      selected patients with ESRF treated with hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD). The data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, 
      including vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral). The follow-up lasted 40 
      months and the final evaluation included the number and causes of deaths, CDV events 
      and disease. Serum Ca, P, ALP, iPTH, albumin, cholesterol, urea and creatinine 
      levels were measured. The plain radiographic films of hands and pelvis evaluated all 
      bone abnormalities suggestive of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) and peripheral vascular 
      calcification (VC). RESULTS: All-cause annual mortality represented 9.25% in HD and 
      9.09% in PD patients. The CDV mortality represented almost 44% in HD patients and 
      66% in PD patients from all deaths. There was a high prevalence of CDV diseases and 
      events. High and low serum P levels were associated with a worse survival rate. 
      Hypercalcaemia was associated with high risk for CDV events in HD patients. In PD 
      patients, the relationship between increased ALP levels and all-cause mortality was 
      significant. Other mineral markers were not predictive of the outcome in the studied 
      patients. In the HD patients the severity of VC was associated with all-cause and 
      CDV mortality, and with CDV events. Male gender, hypercholesterolemia, decreased 
      URR, albumin and creatinine were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. 
      The diabetics had higher death rates. Low dialysis efficacy represented a risk 
      factor for mortality and CDV diseases and events. In PD patients, low albumin 
      induced a higher death rate. In PD patients the death rate was similar to HD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: All-cause mortality was higher than in general population, but 
      lower than the chronic dialysis patients' mortality reported in other studies. The 
      death rates in HD and PD patients were similar. VC and serum P levels influenced the 
      outcome in the HD patients - increased the risk for all-cause and CDV mortality, but 
      also for CDV events. ALP levels influenced outcome in PD patients. There were no 
      significant differences between HD and PD patients regarding outcome.

TI  - Calciphylaxis: emerging concepts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
PG  - 172-86
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a small vessel vasculopathy involving mural calcification with 
      intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and thrombosis. This syndrome occurs predominantly 
      in individuals with renal failure and results in ischemia and necrosis of skin, 
      subcutaneous fat, visceral organs, and skeletal muscle. The syndrome causes 
      significant morbidity in the form of infection, organ failure, and pain. Mortality 
      rates are high. In individuals with renal failure, risk factors for the development 
      of calciphylaxis include female sex, Caucasian race, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. 
      Many cases occur within the first year of dialysis treatment. Several recent reports 
      demonstrate that prolonged hyperphosphatemia and/or elevated calcium x phosphorus 
      products are associated with the syndrome. Protein malnutrition increases the 
      likelihood of calciphylaxis, as does warfarin use and hypercoagulable states, such 
      as protein C and/or protein S deficiency. Recent advances in diagnostic tools and 
      therapeutic strategies have helped in the management of patients with calciphylaxis.

TI  - Renal Resistive Index Is Associated With Inactive Matrix Gla (γ-Carboxyglutamate) 
      Protein in an Adult Population-Based Study.
PG  - e013558
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.013558 [doi]
LID - e013558
AB  - Background Increased renal resistive index (RRI) has been associated with target 
      organ damage as well as renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Matrix Gla 
      (γ-carboxyglutamate) protein (MGP) is a strong inhibitor of soft tissue 
      calcification. Its inactive form (dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP [dp-ucMGP]) has been 
      associated with vascular stiffness, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality. In this 
      study, we hypothesized that high levels of dp-ucMGP were associated with increased 
      RRI. Methods and Results We recruited participants via a multicenter family-based 
      cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Levels of dp-ucMGP were measured in plasma by 
      sandwich ELISA. RRI was measured by Doppler ultrasound in 3 segmental arteries in 
      both kidneys. We used mixed regression models to assess the relationship between 
      dp-ucMGP and RRI. We adjusted for common determinants of RRI as well as renal 
      function and cardiovascular risk factors. We included 1006 participants in our 
      analyses: 526 women and 480 men. Mean values were 0.44±0.20 nmol/L for dp-ucMGP and 
      64±5% for RRI. After multivariable adjustment, dp-ucMGP was positively associated 
      with RRI (P=0.001). In subgroup analysis by age tertiles, this association was not 
      significant in the youngest age group (<38 years; P=0.62), whereas it was 
      significant in older age groups (38-55 and >55 years; P=0.016 and P<0.001, 
      respectively). Conclusions Levels of dp-ucMGP are positively and independently 
      associated with RRI after adjustment for common determinants of RRI, cardiovascular 
      risk factors, and renal function. The stronger association among older adults is 
      probably due, in part, to age-related arterial stiffness. RRI thus seems to reflect 
      the global atherosclerotic burden in a general adult population.

TI  - Kidney function is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in men 
      and women free of cardiovascular disease: the Framingham Heart Study.
PG  - 2017-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the risk of 
      cardiovascular disease is 10 to 20 times higher than the general population. Adults 
      with ESRD have increased coronary-artery calcification (CAC) detected by 
      electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). Because the risk of coronary heart disease 
      is increased even at moderate declines in kidney function, we sought to test whether 
      high CAC scores are seen among those with mild reductions in kidney function. 
      METHODS: Men and women free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease underwent EBCT. 
      Coronary calcium was quantified using the method described by Agatston. Renal 
      function was estimated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Spearman correlation 
      coefficients were used to test the association between GFR and CAC. RESULTS: Three 
      hundred nineteen subjects (162 men/157 women), mean age 60, were included. Mean GFR 
      was 86 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 31-169; 10% with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The 
      median CAC scores by quartile of GFR were 85.9, 48.1, 7.9, and 2.7. Overall, the 
      unadjusted correlation of GFR and CAC was -0.28 (P < 0.0001). This remained 
      significant after adjustment for age and sex (-0.11, P < 0.05), and additionally 
      after adjustment for body mass index (-0.11, P < 0.05), hypertension (-0.11, P < 
      0.05), or total cholesterol (-0.12, P= 0.04). A similar correlation was noted after 
      multivariable adjustment (-0.10, P < 0.08). CONCLUSION: Mild declines in kidney 
      function are associated with subclinical coronary artery calcification in a sample 
      of subjects free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease. This might help 
      explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease among individuals with renal 
      dysfunction. Larger ongoing studies are needed to better quantify this finding.

AB  - Calciphylaxis or calcific arteriolopathy is a rare, life-threatening obstructive 
      pathology of the small cutaneous and subcutaneous vessels. It mainly affects 
      patients with chronic renal failure but it also has been described in patients with 
      normal renal function. The principal risks factors apart from renal failure and 
      phosphocalcic metabolism imbalance are: the female sex, obesity, peripheral vascular 
      disease, diabetes and oral anti-coagulation. We present a very rare case of 
      abdominal, mammarian and upper thighs calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal 
      function. She presented a severe obesity with a recent important loss of weight and 
      had been treated by oral anticoagulants for a long time. She benefited of a 
      multidisciplinary approach with dermatologists, plastic surgeons and anesthesists 
      permitting a recovery in fourteen weeks. Multidisciplinary approach is necessary but 
      the place of the surgery is not well defined. We report a case in which early and 
      wide surgical approach permitted to obtain a favourable evolution of the pathology. 
      Then, we propose a therapeutic strategy after review of the literature.

TI  - Insulin resistance and subclinical abnormalities of global and regional left 
      ventricular function in patients with aortic valve sclerosis.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-13-86 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance, as a key mediator of metabolic syndrome, is thought 
      to be associated with pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease and altered left 
      ventricular (LV) function and structure. However, in patients with aortic valve 
      sclerosis (AVS), the association between insulin resistance and subclinical 
      impairment of LV function is not fully elucidated. METHODS: We studied 57 patients 
      (mean age 70 ± 8 years, 22 women) with asymptomatic AVS but normal LV ejection 
      fraction in echocardiography. LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain 
      rate was analyzed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Patients 
      with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and 
      concomitant coronary artery disease were excluded. They were divided into the 
      insulin-resistant group (AVS+IR; N = 28) and no insulin-resistant group (AVS-IR; 
      N = 29) according to the median value of homeostatic model assessment index. 
      Computed tomography scans were also performed to measure the aortic valve calcium 
      score and the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area. In addition, age- and sex- 
      adjusted 28 control subjects were recruited for the comparison. RESULTS: There were 
      no significant differences in LV ejection fraction or mass index among the groups. 
      The AVS+IR group had a higher aortic valve calcium score (median 94 versus 21, 
      P = 0.022) and a larger VAT area (113 ± 42 cm2 versus 77 ± 38 cm2, P = 0.001) than 
      the AVS-IR group. Notably, LV global longitudinal strain, strain rate (SR), and 
      early diastolic SR were significantly lower in the AVS+IR group than in the AVS-IR 
      group and in control subjects (strain: -16.2 ± 1.6% versus -17.2 ± 1.2% and 
      -18.9 ± 0.8%; SR: -1.18 ± 0.26 s(-1) versus -1.32 ± 0.21 s(-1) and -1.52 ± 0.08 
      s(-1); early diastolic SR: -1.09 ± 0.23 s(-1) versus -1.23 ± 0.18 s(-1) and 
      -1.35 ± 0.12 s(-1); P < 0.05 for all comparison), whereas circumferential function 
      were not significantly different. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed 
      insulin resistance as an independent determinant of LV longitudinal strain 
      (P = 0.017), SR (P = 0.047), and early diastolic SR (P = 0.049) regardless of LV 
      mass index or VAT area. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance is a powerful independent 
      predictor of subclinical LV dysfunction regardless of concomitant visceral obesity 
      and LV hypertrophy. Thus, it may be a novel therapeutic target to prevent subsequent 
      heart failure in patients with AVS.

TI  - Increased circulating sclerostin levels in end-stage renal disease predict 
      biopsy-verified vascular medial calcification and coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 1356-1364
LID - 10.1038/ki.2015.194 [doi]
AB  - Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to mineral 
      bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of vascular 
      calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with measures of 
      calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with end-stage renal 
      disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in the serum of patients 
      with epigastric and coronary artery calcification (calcification score 100 or more). 
      In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin levels significantly associated with 
      age, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent 
      calcification. Multivariable regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin 
      each significantly associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. 
      Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) 
      predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein expressions 
      were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and non-calcified vessels, 
      suggesting that the vasculature is not a major contributor to circulating levels. 
      Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate with the extent of vascular 
      calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery CT and scoring of epigastric 
      artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers of mineral bone disorder, only 
      sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

AB  - Hypertension is very common in dialysis patients. Disorders of mineral metabolism 
      have been linked to vascular calcification and hypertension in dialysis. Fifty-four 
      hemodialysis patients were included in a cross-sectional study in a dialysis unit 
      during a 6-month period. Linear regression analysis was done between averages of 
      calcium and phosphorus (ca x ph) product and blood pressures (BPs). Ca x ph was 
      significantly associated with systolic BP predialysis (P=.03, R=0.28), diastolic BP 
      predialysis (P=.001, R=0.44), predialysis mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P=.002, 
      R=0.4), and diastolic BP postdialysis (P=.03, R=0.26). No relationship was found 
      with pulse pressures. Multilinear regression analysis was then done between ca x ph 
      product and BPs adjusting for age, sex, hemoglobin, diabetes, albumin, parathyroid 
      hormone, ultrafiltration volume, and average BP medications per patient. There was a 
      strong positive association with predialysis systolic BP (P=.003, R(2)=0.49), 
      predialysis MAP (P=.001, R(2)=0.51), and postdialysis MAP (P=.02, R(2)=0.65). No 
      associations with pulse pressures were detected. The study findings suggest that ca 
      x ph product is significantly associated with dialysis MAP and not pulse pressure. 
      This is likely secondary to the stronger relationship with diastolic BP than with 
      systolic BP. Prospective studies looking into the associated hemodynamic parameters 
      related to arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction along with measures for 
      calcifications would be very beneficial.

TI  - Low versus high dialysate calcium concentration in alternate night nocturnal 
      hemodialysis: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 19-28
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12452 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal 
      hemodialysis (NHD) (≥6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what the 
      optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We aimed 
      to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC) dialysate on 
      cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population. METHODS: A randomized 
      controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or HC 
      dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change in mineral 
      metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular calcification 
      (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral arteries (SFA)), pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left ventricular mass index 
      (LVMI) over 12 months. FINDINGS: In the LC group, pre-dialysis ionised calcium 
      decreased -0.12 mmol/L (-0.18-0.06, P = 0.0001) and PTH increased 16 pmol/L 
      (3.5-28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no significant change in the HC 
      group. In both groups, there was no progression of VC in AA or SFA and no change in 
      PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics were prescribed in a higher percentage 
      in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) with a lower proportion of the HC group 
      being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs. 72%). DISCUSSION: Although dialysate calcium 
      prescription influenced biochemical parameters it was not associated with difference 
      in progression of VC between HC and LC groups. An important finding was the 
      potential impact of alternate night NHD in attenuating progression of VC and 
      inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.

TI  - Aortic Calcification and Arterial Stiffness Burden in a Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Cohort with High Cardiovascular Risk: Baseline Characteristics of the Impact of 
      Phosphate Reduction On Vascular End-Points in Chronic Kidney Disease Trial.
PG  - 201-215
LID - 10.1159/000505717 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality compared to the general population. Hyperphosphataemia, associated with 
      vascular calcification and arterial stiffness, may play a key role in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with CKD, although phosphate 
      reduction strategies have not consistently proven to beneficially affect clinically 
      relevant outcomes. The IMpact of Phosphate Reduction On Vascular End-points in CKD 
      (IMPROVE-CKD) study is an international, multi-centre, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of the phosphate binder lanthanum 
      carbonate on intermediate cardiovascular markers in patients with stage 3b-4 CKD. 
      The primary end-point is change in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, 
      SphygmoCor) after 96 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC, computed tomography), serum phosphate and fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF-23). In total, 278 participants were recruited and randomized, mean 
      age 63 ± 13 years, 69% male, 45% diabetes, 32% CVD, 33% stage 3b CKD and 67% stage 4 
      CKD. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate were 26.6 ± 8.3 
      mL/min/1.72 m2 and 1.25 ± 0.20 mmol/L, respectively. Median (interquartile range) 
      intact and c-terminal FGF-23 levels were 133.0 (89.1-202) pg/mL and 221.1 
      (154.3-334.1) RU/mL, respectively. Mean PWV was 10.8 ± 3.6 m/s and 81% had AAC 
      (median Agatston score 1,535 [63-5,744] Hounsfield units). PWV ≥10 m/s was 
      associated with older age, diabetes, CVD, presence of AAC, higher systolic blood 
      pressure (BP), larger waist circumference and higher alkaline phosphatase. AAC was 
      associated with older age, male sex, diabetes, CVD, higher diastolic BP, 
      dyslipidaemia (and use of statins), smoking, larger waist circumference and 
      increased PWV. In conclusion, IMPROVE-CKD participants had high baseline risk for 
      cardiovascular events, as suggested by high baseline PWV and AAC values.

TI  - Epicardial fat, cardiovascular risk factors and calcifications in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 571-579
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfz030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) exerts cardiopathogenic effects, but the 
      independent association between EAT and cardiovascular (CV) calcification in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains controversial. We therefore 
      assessed the association between EAT, CV risk factors and CV calcifications. 
      METHODS: 257 patients with CKD Stage 3 and/or overt proteinuria underwent 
      quantification of EAT, coronary artery calcification and aortic valve calcification 
      by computed tomography. Framingham and American College of Cardiology and American 
      Heart Association (ACC-AHA) 10-year CV event risk scores were calculated for each 
      patient. RESULTS: Using multivariable regression analysis, higher EAT was 
      significantly associated with the majority of investigated risk factors {higher age: 
      odds ratio [OR] 1.05/year [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.08]; male sex: OR 
      4.03 [95% CI 2.22-7.31]; higher BMI: OR 1.28/kg/m(2) [95% CI 1.20-1.37]; former 
      smoking: OR 1.84 [95% CI 1.07-3.17]; lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: OR 
      0.98/mg/dL [95% CI 0.96-1.00] and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate: OR 
      0.98/mL/min/1.73 m(2) [95% CI 0.97-0.99]; all P < 0.05} and was not associated with 
      diabetes mellitus, hypertensive nephropathy, total cholesterol and albuminuria. EAT 
      was positively associated with higher ACC-AHA and Framingham risk scores. EAT 
      correlated with coronary artery calcification and aortic valve calcification 
      [Spearman ρ = 0.388 (95% CI 0.287-0.532) and r (rb) = 0.409 (95% CI 0.310-0.556), 
      respectively], but these correlations were dependent on CV risk factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The increase of EAT can be explained by individual CV risk factors and 
      kidney function and correlates with 10-year risk for CV event scores, suggesting 
      that EAT is a modifiable risk factor in patients with CKD. Although EAT correlates 
      with CV calcifications, these relations depend on CV risk factors.

TI  - Arteriosclerosis Is a Major Predictor of Small Bowel Vascular Lesions.
PG  - 723-730
LID - 10.1007/s10620-018-4930-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies have focused on evaluating the association between the 
      presence of small bowel vascular lesions (SBVLs) and patients' comorbidities. AIMS: 
      We sought to uncover a more fundamental indicator that may predict the presence of 
      SBVLs by considering atherosclerosis qualitatively and quantitatively. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 79 consecutive patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding who had 
      undergone computed tomography (CT) and capsule endoscopy or double-balloon endoscopy 
      from January 2015 to June 2017. The SBVL frequency, type, and location, and the 
      relationship between the presence of SBVLs and the patients' clinical 
      characteristics were evaluated. Arterial wall calcification was assessed on 
      unenhanced CT images, and a modified Agatston scoring system was used to determine 
      the abdominal aorta calcium scores. RESULTS: Of the 27 (34%) patients with SBVLs, 15 
      (19%) had type 1a, 12 (15%) had type 1b, and 2 (3%) had type 2a SBVLs. Most of the 
      lesions were located in the jejunum. Cardiovascular disease (P = .017), chronic 
      kidney disease (P = .025), and arteriosclerosis (P = .0036) were associated with the 
      presence of SBVLs. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that arteriosclerosis 
      (odds ratio [OR] 7.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-143.9) and superior 
      mesenteric artery calcification (OR 16.3; 95% CI 3.64-118.6) were independent 
      predictors of the presence of SBVLs. The modified Agatston score was significantly 
      higher in SBVL cases than in non-SBVL cases (6384 vs. 2666, P = .0023). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Arteriosclerosis, especially increased superior mesenteric artery calcification, is 
      associated with an increased likelihood of SBVLs.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of coronary microvascular dysfunction among chest 
      pain patients in the emergency department.
PG  - 5-13
LID - 10.1177/2048872618764418 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is common in patients with 
      non-obstructive coronary arteries but has not been described in low-risk symptomatic 
      patients. We therefore assessed the prevalence and characteristics of CMD in low to 
      moderate risk patients with chest pain in an emergency department. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We used three-dimensional Rb(82) cardiac positron emission 
      tomography/computed tomography to diagnose coronary artery disease (known or new 
      regional defect, any coronary calcification) and CMD (low coronary flow reserve 
      without coronary artery disease) in chest pain patients after being ruled out for 
      acute myocardial infarction. Exclusions included age 30 years or less, acute 
      myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, heart failure and dialysis. Among 
      195 participants undergoing cardiac positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography, 42% had CMD, 36% had coronary artery disease and 22% had normal flows; 
      70% were women and 84% were obese. Patients with CMD and coronary artery disease had 
      significantly lower coronary flow reserve than normal patients (mean coronary flow 
      reserve 1.6 and 1.9 vs. 2.6, respectively, P<0.05). However, CMD patients were 
      younger (mean age 51 vs. 61 years), and had fewer traditional cardiac risk factors 
      (P<0.05) than patients with coronary artery disease. Nearly one third (31%) of 
      patients had a prior emergency department visit for chest pain within three years of 
      index presentation. Women were four times as likely to have CMD as men (adjusted 
      odds ratio 4.2; 95% confidence interval 1.8, 9.6) after controlling for age, race, 
      hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity and family history of 
      coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their low-risk profile, nearly one 
      half of symptomatic and mostly obese emergency department patients without evidence 
      of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease had CMD. The results could 
      explain the high rates of return visits associated with chest pain, although their 
      application to the general emergency department population require validation.

TI  - Sex-specific relationship between vascular calcification and incident fracture in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 344-355
LID - 10.23876/j.krcp.20.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is a major component of mineral bone 
      disorders in patients with endstage renal disease (ESRD). Bone metabolism is 
      affected by various factors, including sex hormones. This study investigated whether 
      there was a sex-specific relationship between VC and incident fracture in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of dialysis patients from 
      a single center. VC was assessed by the aortic calcification index (ACI) using 
      abdominal computed tomography. Patients were grouped by sex and stratified into low 
      or high ACI groups, according to the median ACI value. The association between ACI 
      and incident fracture was analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 593 patients (male: n = 328, 
      median ACI, 14.57; female: n = 265, median ACI, 19.44) were included. During a 
      median follow-up of 36.7 months, 71 patients (12.0%) developed fractures. The 
      fracturefree survival rate was significantly lower in the high ACI group versus the 
      low ACI group, both in males (P = 0.021) and females (P = 0.001). In males, 
      multivariate analysis showed that the high ACI group and ACI per se were not 
      significant risks for fracture. However, in females, both the high ACI group 
      (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.720; P = 0.003) and ACI per se (adjusted hazard ratio, 
      1.768; P = 0.035) were independently associated with fracture after adjustment for 
      confounding variables. CONCLUSION: VC was independently associated with incident 
      fracture in female patients with ESRD. There may be a sex-specific relationship 
      between VC and fracture in patients with ESRD.

TI  - Alkalosis and Dialytic Clearance of Phosphate Increases Phosphatase Activity: A 
      Hidden Consequence of Hemodialysis.
PG  - e0159858
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159858 [doi]
LID - e0159858
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular pyrophosphate is a potent endogenous inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification, which is degraded by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and generated by 
      hydrolysis of ATP via ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). 
      ALP activity (as routinely measured in clinical practice) represents the maximal 
      activity (in ideal conditions), but not the real activity (in normal or 
      physiological conditions). For the first time, the present study investigated 
      extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism during hemodialysis sessions (including its 
      synthesis via eNPP1 and its degradation via ALP) in physiological conditions. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: 45 patients in hemodialysis were studied. Physiological ALP 
      activity represents only 4-6% of clinical activity. ALP activity increased 
      post-hemodialysis by 2% under ideal conditions (87.4 ± 3.3 IU/L vs. 89.3 ± 3.6 IU/L) 
      and 48% under physiological conditions (3.5 ± 0.2 IU/L vs. 5.2 ± 0.2 IU/L). 
      Pyrophosphate synthesis by ATP hydrolysis remained unaltered post-hemodialysis. 
      Post-hemodialysis plasma pH (7.45 ± 0.02) significantly increased compared with the 
      pre-dialysis pH (7.26 ± 0.02). The slight variation in pH (~0.2 units) induced a 
      significant increase in ALP activity (9%). Addition of phosphate in 
      post-hemodialysis plasma significantly decreased ALP activity, although this effect 
      was not observed with the addition of urea. Reduction in phosphate levels and 
      increment in pH were significantly associated with an increase in physiological ALP 
      activity post-hemodialysis. A decrease in plasma pyrophosphate levels (3.3 ± 0.3 
      μmol/L vs. 1.9 ± 0.1 μmol/L) and pyrophosphate/ATP ratio (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) 
      post-hemodialysis was also observed. CONCLUSION: Extraction of uremic toxins, 
      primarily phosphate and hydrogen ions, dramatically increases the ALP activity under 
      physiological conditions. This hitherto unknown consequence of hemodialysis suggests 
      a reinterpretation of the clinical value of this parameter.

TI  - Pulse wave velocity--a useful tool for cardiovascular surveillance in pre-dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 3527-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is high among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a simple method used for arterial 
      distensibility evaluation. Few data are available concerning PWV in pre-dialysis 
      patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between PWV and 
      cardiovascular disease in pre-dialysis. METHODS: One hundred and four patients were 
      submitted to PWV analysis, coronary artery calcium (CAC) determination with a 
      multi-slice CT scan of the coronary arteries, echocardiogram and a carotid 
      intima-media thickness (IMT) evaluation, with a high resolution ultrasound. The 
      demographic characteristics and laboratory tests results were studied. RESULTS: The 
      mean age of those studied was 54.4 +/- 11.5 years, 60% were males and the mean 
      creatinine clearance was 40 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The mean PWV was 12.2 +/- 3.4 m/s and 
      it was significantly higher in males, diabetics, those with creatinine clearance <60 
      ml/min and proteinuria > or =1 g/24 h. PWV was correlated with systolic blood 
      pressure, age, triglycerides, total cholesterol and 24 h proteinuria. In the 
      multiple regression analysis, PWV was significantly associated with diabetes, age, 
      systolic blood pressure and cholesterol. Fifty-eight patients (56%) presented 
      coronary calcification and PWV correlated with coronary calcium score (R = 0.48; P < 
      0.001) and calcium volume (R = 0.50; P < 0.001). Moreover, PWV was higher in 
      patients with coronary calcification (13.4 +/- 3.6 m/s vs 10.7 +/- 2.4 m/s; P < 
      0.001). The mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was 106 +/- 31 g/m(2) and 24% of 
      patients had left ventricular hypertrophy, while 19 (18.3%) patients had left 
      ventricular dysfunction. PVW was correlated with LVMI (R = 0.25; P = 0.01) while no 
      association could be seen between PWV and the ejection fraction or left ventricular 
      dysfunction. A correlation between the IMT and PWV was observed (R = 0.27; P = 
      0.005). In addition, those with a thicker IMT had a higher PWV (13.2 +/- 3.4 m/s vs 
      11. 2 +/- 3.2 m/s; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: PWV is associated with cardiovascular 
      disease in pre-dialysis patients and can be a useful tool to identify patients with 
      increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Influence of intraoperative findings on immediate flow through radial-cephalic 
      arteriovenous wrist fistulas for hemodialysis access.
PG  - 208-214
LID - 10.1590/1677-5449.001518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate flow through a newly created arteriovenous fistula depends on 
      multiple characteristics of the vessels and patient comorbidities. Several studies 
      have related preoperative findings to failure, but few have analyzed the influence 
      of intraoperative findings. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive value of 
      intraoperative findings on the immediate outcome of radial-cephalic arteriovenous 
      wrist fistulas (RCAVF) by collecting data that are easily measured intraoperatively. 
      METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study, in which a single surgeon performed 
      101 RCAVF in 100 patients at a single center. We analyzed the immediate 
      postoperative flow, assessed by thrill intensity immediately after fistula creation, 
      against patient demographics and intraoperative data. The following variables were 
      analyzed: age, sex, comorbidities, length of vein visible at preoperative 
      examination, macroscopic arterial calcification, maximum vein diameter, and length 
      of stenosis-free vein, measured by cannulation with a urethral catheter during the 
      procedure. The chi-square test was used both to eliminate possible bias introduced 
      by side of venous access (left or right), and to determine predictive values of 
      immediate thrill. RESULTS: Side of access was not associated with any significant 
      differences in variables. Absence of macroscopic arterial calcification, successful 
      venous catheterization using a 6 French catheter or larger, and ability to advance 
      it more than 10 centimeters along the lumen of the proximal vein were correlated 
      with adequate immediate postoperative thrill (p = 0.004, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of 101 RCAVF, both the diameter of the 
      catheter and its progress through the proximal vein and also absence of arterial 
      calcification had positive predictive value for achieving adequate immediate thrill 
      after vascular access construction.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of uremic patients. In addition to 
      classical risk factors such as age, male gender, smoking, inflammation, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which also exist in the general 
      population, patients with chronic renal failure have other risk factors such as 
      oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, 
      hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and overtreatment with calcium and vitamin D. 
      These latter risk factors may even have a better predictive value than classical 
      risk factors for coronary heart disease in uremic patients.

AB  - AIMS: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) has been recently introduced in the clinical 
      practice. Rather than interfering with vitamin K-dependent posttranscriptional 
      modification of various proteins, DOACs selectively inhibit factors involved in the 
      coagulation cascade. In particular, in contrast with Warfarin, Rivaroxabn does not 
      interfere with activation of matrix Gla Protein (MGP), a potent vascular 
      calcification Inhibitor. We herein sought to investigate the impact of Rivaroxaban 
      and Warfarin on cardiac valve calcifications in a cohort of moderate-to advanced CKD 
      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, 
      longitudinal study. Consecutive CKD stage 3b - 4 (according to KDIGO guidelines) 
      patients from 8 cardiologic outpatient clinics were enrolled between May 2015 and 
      October 2017. All patients received anticoagulation (100 Warfarin vs 247 
      Rivaroxaban) as part of their non-valvular atrial fibrillation management. Cardiac 
      valve calcification was evaluated via standard trans-thoracic echocardiogram. 347 
      patients (mean age: 66 years; mean eGFR: 37 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) were studied. Over a 
      mean follow-up period of 16 months, Rivaroxaban compared to Warfarin reduced both 
      mitral and aortic valve calcifications (p < 0.001) independently of the degree of 
      calcifications at baseline and potential confounders. Notably, Rivaroxaban use was 
      also associated with a significant reduction in C reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001) 
      during follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study generates the hypothesis that the use of 
      Rivaroxaban associates with a reduction of cardiac valve calcification deposition 
      and progression as compared to Warfarin, in a cohort of CKD stage 3b-4 patients. 
      Future endeavors are needed to confirm and to establish the mechanisms responsible 
      for these findings.

      dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement 
      of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication 
      cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including 
      changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are 
      nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Dialysis 
      patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 
      2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the 
      time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical 
      outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve 
      dialysis patients. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age 
      was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of 
      cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 
      27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium 
      (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) 
      (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), 
      calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin 
      (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular 
      events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality 
      rate of 19% (n = 13). CONCLUSION: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet 
      withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium 
      and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

TI  - Potential Role of H-Ferritin in Mitigating Valvular Mineralization.
PG  - 413-431
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312191 [doi]
AB  - Objective- Calcific aortic valve disease is a prominent finding in elderly and in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease. We investigated the potential role of iron 
      metabolism in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. Approach and 
      Results- Cultured valvular interstitial cells of stenotic aortic valve with 
      calcification from patients undergoing valve replacement exhibited significant 
      susceptibility to mineralization/osteoblastic transdifferentiation in response to 
      phosphate. This process was abrogated by iron via induction of H-ferritin as 
      reflected by lowering ALP and osteocalcin secretion and preventing extracellular 
      calcium deposition. Cellular phosphate uptake and accumulation of lysosomal 
      phosphate were decreased. Accordingly, expression of phosphate transporters Pit1 and 
      Pit2 were repressed. Translocation of ferritin into lysosomes occurred with high 
      phosphate-binding capacity. Importantly, ferritin reduced nuclear accumulation of 
      RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), and as a reciprocal effect, it enhanced 
      nuclear localization of transcription factor Sox9 (SRY [sex-determining region 
      Y]-box 9). Pyrophosphate generation was also increased via upregulation of ENPP2 
      (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-2). (3)H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione 
      mimicked these beneficial effects in valvular interstitial cell via induction of 
      H-ferritin. Ferroxidase activity of H-ferritin was essential for this function, as 
      ceruloplasmin exhibited similar inhibitory functions. Histological analysis of 
      stenotic aortic valve revealed high expression of H-ferritin without iron 
      accumulation and its relative dominance over ALP in noncalcified regions. Increased 
      expression of H-ferritin accompanied by elevation of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) 
      and IL-1β (interleukin-1β) levels, inducers of H-ferritin, corroborates the 
      essential role of ferritin/ferroxidase via attenuating inflammation in calcific 
      aortic valve disease. Conclusions- Our results indicate that H-ferritin is a 
      stratagem in mitigating valvular mineralization/osteoblastic differentiation. 
      Utilization of 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione to induce ferritin expression may prove a 
      novel therapeutic potential in valvular mineralization.

      and/or coronary artery disease.
PG  - 880-90
AB  - Little is known about the association between plasma levels of pigment 
      epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). This study evaluated 289 consecutive patients with chest pain 
      or at least one coronary risk factor who underwent coronary angiography using 
      multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT). Presence of CAD and CKD, CAD severity 
      (i.e. number of significantly stenosed coronary vessels, described as vessel disease 
      [VD]), coronary calcification scores, visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area 
      on MDCT, and metabolic biomarkers were recorded. PEDF levels correlated 
      significantly with sex, VFA, CKD presence/hyperuricaemia and high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PEDF levels were closely associated with CKD and 
      were significantly higher in CKD patients than in non-CKD patients, regardless of 
      the presence of CAD. CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD had higher plasma PEDF 
      levels than non-CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD. It is concluded that PEDF may 
      be associated with CKD regardless of the presence of CAD.

TI  - Prevalence and correlates of depression in individuals with and without type 1 
      diabetes.
PG  - 575-9
LID - 10.2337/dc08-1835 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is associated with poor glycemic control and complications in 
      people with type 1 diabetes. We assessed the prevalence of depression and 
      antidepressant medication use among adults with and without type 1 diabetes and the 
      association between depression and diabetes complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: In 2006-2008, the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes Study 
      applied the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) to 458 participants with type 1 
      diabetes (47% male, aged 44 +/- 9 years, type 1 diabetes duration 29 +/- 9 years) 
      and 546 participants without diabetes (nondiabetic group) (51% male, aged 47 +/- 9 
      years). Use of antidepressant medication was self-reported. Depression was defined 
      as a BDI-II score >14 and/or use of antidepressant medication. Occurrence of 
      diabetes complications (retinopathy, blindness, neuropathy, diabetes-related 
      amputation, and kidney or pancreas transplantation) was self-reported. RESULTS: Mean 
      BDI-II score, adjusted for age and sex, was significantly higher in participants 
      with type 1 diabetes than in nondiabetic participants (least-squares mean +/- SE: 
      7.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.3; P < 0.0001). Type 1 diabetic participants reported 
      using more antidepressant medications (20.7 vs. 12.1%, P = 0.0003). More type 1 
      diabetic than nondiabetic participants were classified as depressed by BDI-II cut 
      score (17.5 vs. 5.7%, P < 0.0001) or by either BDI-II cut score or antidepressant 
      use (32.1 vs. 16.0%, P < 0.0001). Participants reporting diabetes complications (n = 
      209) had higher mean BDI-II scores than those without complications (10.7 +/- 9.3 
      vs. 6.4 +/- 6.3, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nondiabetic participants, 
      adults with type 1 diabetes report more symptoms of depression and more 
      antidepressant medication usage. Depression is highly prevalent in type 1 diabetes 
      and requires further study on assessment and treatment.

TI  - Cross-sectional association of kidney function with valvular and annular 
      calcification: the Framingham heart study.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - Valvular calcification is common in the setting of end-stage kidney disease and is 
      associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease events. It is unknown 
      whether the prevalence of valvular calcification is increased in milder kidney 
      disease after accounting for cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who attended 
      the sixth examination of the Framingham Offspring Study (1995 to 1998) were 
      eligible. Kidney function was estimated by GFR using the simplified Modification of 
      Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Mitral annular calcification (MAC), aortic 
      sclerosis, and aortic annular calcification were assessed by two-dimensional 
      echocardiography. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of valvular 
      calcification among participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD; GFR < 60 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2)). A total of 3047 participants (52% women; mean age 59 +/- 10 yr) were 
      available for analysis. CKD was present in 8.6% (n = 262) of the sample. Among 
      participants with valve/annular calcification (n = 284; 9.3%), 20% had CKD, compared 
      with 7% in patients without valvular calcification. After adjustment for age, 
      gender, systolic and diastolic BP, hypertension treatment, total/HDL cholesterol, 
      body mass index, diabetes, smoking status, and cardiovascular disease, participants 
      with CKD had a 60% increased odds of MAC (odds ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 
      1.03 to 2.5). There was no significant association between CKD and either aortic 
      sclerosis or aortic annular calcification (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.1, respectively). 
      After age and gender adjustment, the combination of both CKD and MAC was associated 
      with a three-fold increased risk for death compared with those with neither 
      condition (P = 0.0004). In the community, CKD is associated with presence of MAC 
      before the onset of ESRD. Further research is warranted to understand whether 
      traditional and novel vascular risk factor burden, as well as metabolic derangements 
      found in early kidney disease, can account for the CKD-MAC association.

TI  - Suboptimal vitamin K status and its risk factors in a population of Chinese chronic 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 625-31
LID - 10.1111/nep.12494 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Vitamin K deficiency is known to be common in haemodialysis patients and 
      associates with adverse outcomes in this population, particularly vascular 
      calcification. We aimed to investigate the vitamin K status in a population of 
      Chinese haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We collected demographic and 
      biochemical data from a population of maintenance HD (MHD) patients in our unit and 
      a control group composed of healthy subjects from our outpatient clinic. Fasting 
      serum samples from all subjects were collected for the measurement of known vitamin 
      K-dependent proteins i.e. matrix Gla protein (MGP), osteocalcin (OC) and 
      uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC). We also quantified the fraction of ucOC to total 
      OC (%ucOC). Differences of these parameters between groups were analyzed and risk 
      factors of vitamin K deficiency based on the definition as per %ucOC were 
      investigated. RESULTS: We enrolled 93 MHD patients as a test group and 93 healthy 
      subjects as a control group. There was no significant difference in MGP between 
      groups (4.0 ± 2.8 pg/mL in MHD vs 4.2 ± 1.2 pg/mL in control; P = 0.676). Mean %ucOC 
      was significantly greater in the MHD patients as compared to control subjects 
      (76.4 ± 20.0% in MHD vs 48.56 ± 15.5%; P < 0.001). Time on dialysis and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol level appeared to be indicators of vitamin K deficiency, 
      with the former being an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Defining Vitamin K 
      deficiency by %ucOC, suboptimal vitamin K levels appear common in Chinese MHD 
      patients. Time on dialysis and LDL cholesterol level predict vitamin K deficiency.

AB  - Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with poor angiographic results and 
      higher rates of complications after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
      Limited data are available regarding the impact of angiographically evident CAC on 
      long-term outcomes after primary PCI in patients presenting with ST-segment 
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this single-center, registry-based 
      retrospective cohort analysis, we analyzed 2,143 consecutive patients presenting 
      with STEMI who underwent primary PCI within 12 hours of symptom onset. Patients were 
      divided based on degree of CAC (determined by visual inspection of angiograms) as 
      follows: (1) moderate-to-severe CAC (n = 306; 14.3%) and (2) minimal-to-none CAC 
      (n = 1,837; 85.7%). The primary end point was all-cause mortality at 1-year after 
      PCI. Patients with moderate-to-severe CAC were older, women, and had higher rates of 
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease. 
      Moderate-to-severe CAC was associated with higher rates of anterior myocardial 
      infarction, advanced Killip class, and poor final angiographic results. At 1-year 
      follow-up, rates of all-cause mortality were higher in the moderate-to-severe CAC 
      cohort than those in the minimal-to-none CAC cohort (8.5% vs 4.7%; p = 0.008). 
      However, after accounting for major clinical and angiographic characteristics, 
      moderate-to-severe CAC on presenting STEMI angiogram was no longer predictive of 
      1-year all-cause mortality. In conclusion, advanced CAC burden occurs in ∼15% of 
      patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI and reflects a marker of adverse prognosis 
      late into follow-up after PCI.

TI  - Off-pump coronary surgery: surgical strategy for the high-risk patient.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective study, we compared two groups of consecutive patients 
      operated by the same team during the year 2000 for coronary artery disease with the 
      use of extracorporeal circulation (group 1, n=230) or on the beating heart using the 
      Octopus II plus stabiliser (group 2, n=228). High-risk patients were identified by a 
      EuroSCORE plus 6. EuroSCORE definitions and predicted risk models were utilized to 
      compare the variables of the groups. METHODS: There were no significant differences 
      between the preoperative variables of the groups in age, gender, left ventricular 
      function, diabetes and peripheral vascular and renal disease as is indicated by the 
      Euroscore (resp. 4.7/5.1 p=0.107). Calcification of the ascending aorta and chronic 
      obstructive lung disease were statistically significant more prevalent in the 
      beating heart group. No differences in preoperative variables in the high-risk 
      patients group (Euroscore 8.5/8.1 p=0.356) except for calcification of the ascending 
      aorta. RESULTS: All patients underwent a full revascularisation through a midline 
      sternotomy. Significant more distal anastomoses were performed in group 1 (3.7 per 
      patient (1-6)) with regard to group 2 (2.9 per patient (1-6)). Anesthesia, 
      postoperative treatment and follow up were equal for both groups. A significant 
      lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.010), shorter ICU stay (p=0.031) and 
      renal insufficiency (p=0.033) was reported in group 2. In the low risk group, we 
      could not diagnose any difference between the two groups, except for atrial 
      fibrillation. The benefits of the beating heart surgery however were more pronounced 
      in the high-risk patient as is indicated by a significant reduction of the ICU stay 
      by 1 day (3.5d/2.5d (p=0.028)), better preservation of the renal function (p=0.017) 
      and a significant reduction of the length of hospital stay by more than two days 
      (p=0.040). A lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, however not significant. 
      CONCLUSION: In our experience, beating heart surgery is a safe alternative for 
      conventional coronary heart surgery. High-risk patients do benefit most from this 
      technique. It became our first choice in the elderly patient and patients presenting 
      with higher co-morbidities.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene promoter 
      polymorphisms are associated with mortality in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2207-12
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major causes 
      of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a 
      family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in 
      atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of 
      atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G) and 
      MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery 
      calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) 
      and all-cause mortality risk in HD. METHODS: Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up 
      for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD 
      patients' characteristics were age 64 +/- 13 years, males 64%, diabetic 24%, 
      hypertensive 62%, smokers 38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all undergoing standard HD thrice 
      weekly. RESULTS: ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was 
      associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, diabetes, 
      hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage 
      and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for 
      the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 
      3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity 
      significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 
      (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first 
      time that MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors 
      for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. 
      These data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis 
      of the increased mortality in HD patients.

TI  - Association between very low PTH levels and poor survival rates in haemodialysis 
      patients: results from the French ARNOS cohort.
PG  - c211-6
LID - 10.1159/000321642 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated with 
      an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and mortality in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency, the 
      associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent 
      HD patients. METHODS: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the 
      French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the 
      Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 
      1) and ≥ 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis was 
      performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded. 
      RESULTS: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 
      (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels 
      (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 
      1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 
      0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 
      0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds 
      ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and 
      serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any 
      PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet 
      (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥ 1.5 mmol/l (94%)). CONCLUSION: In this 
      observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and 
      was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be 
      responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic 
      bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing 
      vascular calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using 
      fewer PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor 
      prognosis.

TI  - APOL1 nephropathy risk variants do not associate with subclinical atherosclerosis or 
      left ventricular mass in middle-aged black adults.

AB  - Prior studies reported associations of APOL1 nephropathy risk variants with 
      subclinical atherosclerosis. However, these findings were limited to older 
      individuals with high comorbidities. To evaluate this in younger individuals, we 
      calculated associations of APOL1 risk variants (high risk [2 risk variants] vs. low 
      risk [0-1 risk variant]) with prevalent, incident, or progressive coronary artery 
      calcification, a carotid intima media thickness over the 90th percentile, and left 
      ventricular hypertrophy in 1315 black participants of the Coronary Artery Risk 
      Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The mean age of this cohort was 44.6 
      years and their mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 102.5 ml/min/1.73m(2). 
      High-risk participants were found to be younger and have a higher prevalence of 
      albuminuria than low-risk participants. In Poisson regression models adjusted for 
      comorbidities and kidney function, the risk of prevalent coronary artery 
      calcification (relative risk [95% confidence interval] 1.12 [0.72,1.71]), the 
      incident coronary artery calcification (1.50 [0.87,2.59]), and the progression of 
      coronary artery calcification (1.40 [0.88,2.23]) did not significantly differ in 
      high vs. low-risk participants. Furthermore, the risk of carotid intima media 
      thickness over the 90th percentile (1.28 [0.78,2.10]) and left ventricular 
      hypertrophy (1.02[0.73,1.43]) did not significantly differ in high vs. low-risk 
      participants in fully-adjusted models. Thus, APOL1 risk variants did not associate 
      with subclinical markers of atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy in 
      middle-aged black adults with preserved kidney function.

TI  - Parathyroid ultrasonography and bone metabolic profile of patients on dialysis with 
      hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 437-47
LID - 10.5527/wjn.v5.i5.437 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the parathyroid ultrasonography and define parameters that can 
      predict poor response to treatment in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      due to renal failure. METHODS: This cohort study evaluated 85 patients with chronic 
      kidney disease stage V with parathyroid hormone levels above 800 pg/mL. All patients 
      underwent ultrasonography of the parathyroids and the following parameters were 
      analyzed: Demographic characteristics (etiology of chronic kidney disease, gender, 
      age, dialysis vintage, vascular access, use of vitamin D), laboratory (calcium, 
      phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase), 
      and the occurrence of bone changes, cardiovascular events and death. The χ(2) test 
      were used to compare proportions or the Fisher exact test for small sample 
      frequencies. Student t-test was used to detect differences between the two groups 
      regarding continuous variables. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (66.4%) had 
      parathyroid nodules with higher levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium and 
      phosphorus. Sixteen patients underwent parathyroidectomy and had higher levels of 
      phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus product (P = 0.03 and P = 0.006, respectively). 
      They also had lower mortality (32% vs 68%, P = 0.01) and lower incidence of 
      cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (27% vs 73%, P = 0.02). Calcium × 
      phosphorus product above 55 mg(2)/dL(2) [RR 1.48 (1.06, 2.08), P = 0.03], presence 
      of vascular calcification [1.33 (1.01, 1.76), P = 0.015] and previous occurrence of 
      vascular events [RR 2.25 (1.27, 3.98), P < 0.001] were risk factors for mortality in 
      this population. There was no association between the occurrence of nodules and 
      mortality. CONCLUSION: The identification of nodules at ultrasonography strengthens 
      the indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      due to renal failure.

TI  - Plasma homocysteine predicts progression of atherosclerosis.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - MINI ABSTRACT: Three emerging risk factors potentially useful in predicting future 
      cardiac events are electron-beam computed tomography (EBT), homocysteine(HCY), and 
      C-reactive Protein (CRP). We evaluated a cohort of 133 serial asymptomatic patients, 
      who underwent two consecutive EBT scans (8-84 months apart) and a comprehensive 
      cardiac risk factor assessment, including measurements for lipids, ultrasensitive 
      CRP and homocysteine. Individuals with elevated HCY (> or =12 micromol/L) 
      demonstrated a mean increase in CC progression of 35% per year, while those with HCY 
      <12 micromol/L (median) progressed at 17% per year (p = 0.0008). Patients with a 
      level equal to or lower than the median value of CRP (0.8 mg/L) had a median yearly 
      progression of 22%, compared to 21% for those with CRP value = 0.9-11 mg/L (p = ns). 
      Presence of elevated HCY (>12 micromol/L) strongly and independently predicts 
      progression of coronary plaque burden. BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of 
      effective preventive therapies, coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading 
      cause of morbidity and mortality. Use of traditional cardiovascular risk factors is 
      imprecise and predicts less than one half of future cardiovascular events. Three 
      'emerging risk factors', as potential means of identifying subclinical 
      atherosclerosis and predicting future cardiovascular events, are electron-beam 
      computed tomography, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein. Given the evidence that 
      HCY and CRP are involved in atherogenesis, we hypothesized that significant 
      progression of EBT calcium score (a measure of atherosclerotic plaque burden) is 
      associated with higher levels of these markers. METHODS: We evaluated 133 
      asymptomatic patients (100 men, 33 women; mean age was 61 +/- 9 years) who underwent 
      previous EBT calcium score testing at Harbor-UCLA 8-80 months prior to enrollment 
      (mean follow-up 20 months). Exclusion criteria included those with known or 
      symptomatic CAD and chronic renal disease. During enrollment, we measured risk 
      factors, serum HCY, serum lipids, ultrasensitive-CRP, and repeat EBT calcium scan. 
      Statistical analysis was performed using probable Chi square method, and Student's 
      t-test. RESULTS: Individuals with elevated HCY (> or =12 micromol/L) demonstrated a 
      mean increase in CC progression of 35% per year, while those with HCY <12 micromol/L 
      (median) progressed at 17% per year (p = 0.0008). Patients with a level equal to or 
      lower than the median value of CRP (0.8 mg/L) had a median yearly progression of 
      22%, compared to 21% for those with CRP value = 0.9-11 mg/L (p = ns). Neither 
      cholesterol values, body mass index, gender, age nor presence of individual risk 
      factors predicted progression of coronary calcium. CONCLUSION: Presence of elevated 
      HCY (>12 micromol/L) strongly and independently predicts progression of coronary 
      plaque burden.

PG  - 4310379

LID - 4310379
AB  - Cardiovascular complications are extremely frequent in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and death from cardiac causes is the most common cause of death in 
      this particular population. Cardiovascular disease is approximately 3 times more 
      frequent in patients with CKD than in other known cardiovascular risk groups and 
      cardiovascular mortality is approximately 10-fold more frequent in patients on 
      dialysis compared to the age- and sex-matched segments of the nonrenal population. 
      Among other structural and functional factors advanced calcification of 
      atherosclerotic plaques as well as of the arterial and venous media has been 
      described as potentially relevant for this high cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. One potential explanation for this exceedingly high vascular 
      calcification in animal models as well as in patients with CKD increased systemic 
      and most importantly local (micro)inflammation that has been shown to favor the 
      development of calcifying particles by multiple ways. Of note, local vascular 
      upregulation of proinflammatory and proosteogenic molecules is already present at 
      early stages of CKD and may thus be operative for vascular calcification. In 
      addition, increased expression of costimulatory molecules and mast cells has also 
      been documented in patients with CKD pointing to a more inflammatory and potentially 
      less stable phenotype of coronary atherosclerotic plaques in CKD.

TI  - Calcium supplementation: lessons from the general population for chronic kidney 
      disease and back.
PG  - 369-75
LID - 10.1097/MNH.0b013e328347486a [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Concern that calcium use may increase cardiovascular risk was 
      previously the domain of nephrologists. By contrast, calcium supplementation has 
      been promoted within the general community as beneficial to the maintenance of bone 
      mineral density, as an adjunct to osteoporosis therapies and as potentially useful 
      for cardiovascular health. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of patients with normal serum 
      creatinine levels have reported that combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation 
      reduced fracture risk, and osteoporosis trials have generally included calcium and 
      vitamin D in placebo and active arms. However, an increased risk of myocardial 
      infarction and other cardiovascular events has now been reported in secondary 
      analysis of a fracture study of patients taking calcium or placebo, in subsequent 
      meta-analysis of 15 similar studies, and most recently in re-analysis of the Women's 
      Health Initiative calcium, vitamin D dataset. These reports have been criticized 
      regarding event ascertainment, adjudication and the use of composite outcomes. 
      SUMMARY: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have impaired renal calcium 
      regulation, abnormal bone turnover and are predisposed to positive calcium balance. 
      If these general population data are proven, they should heighten our unease 
      regarding the use of calcium salts in all stages of CKD, and particularly for 
      patients with prevalent vascular calcification, suspected adynamic bone and high 
      bone turnover.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification as an important predictor for all-cause mortality and 
      cardiovascular mortality in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients: a prospective 
      study.
PG  - 159-68
AB  - Calcification complications are frequent among long-term dialysis patients. However, 
      the prognostic implication of cardiac valve calcification in this population is not 
      known. This study aimed to determine if cardiac valve calcification predicts 
      mortality in long-term dialysis patients. Baseline echocardiography was performed in 
      192 patients (mean +/- SD age, 55 +/- 12 yr) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (mean +/- SD duration of dialysis, 39 +/- 31 mo) to screen for 
      calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, or both. Valvular calcification was 
      present in 62 patients. During the mean follow-up of 17.9 mo (range, 0.6 to 33.9 
      mo), 46 deaths (50% of cardiovascular causes) were observed. Overall 1-yr survival 
      was 70% and 93% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001, 
      log-rank test). Cardiovascular mortality was 22% and 3% for patients with and 
      without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis 
      showed that cardiac valve calcification was predictive of an increased all-cause 
      mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.76; P = 0.005) and 
      cardiovascular death (HR 5.39; 95% CI, 2.16 to 13.48; P = 0.0003) independent of 
      age, male gender, dialysis duration, C-reactive protein, diabetes, and 
      atherosclerotic vascular disease. Eighty-nine percent of patients with both valvular 
      calcification and atherosclerotic vascular disease, 23% of patients with valvular 
      calcification only, 21% of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 
      13% of patients with neither complication died at 1-yr (P < 0.0005). The 
      cardiovascular death rate was 85% for patients with both complications, 13% for 
      patients with valvular calcification only, 14% for patients with atherosclerotic 
      vascular disease only, and 5% for those with neither complication (P < 0.0005). The 
      number of calcified valves was associated with all-cause mortality (P < 0.0005) and 
      cardiovascular death (P < 0.0005). One-year all-cause mortality was 57% for patients 
      with both aortic and mitral valves calcified, 40% for those with either valve 
      calcified, and 15% for those with neither valve calcified. In conclusion, cardiac 
      valve calcification is a powerful predictor for mortality and cardiovascular deaths 
      in long-term dialysis patients. Valvular calcification by itself has similar 
      prognostic importance as the presence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Its 
      coexistence with other atherosclerotic complications indicates more severe disease 
      and has the worst outcome.

TI  - The prevalence and predictors of atrial fibrillation in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 8-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of atrial 
      fibrillation in long-term hemodialysis patients and to identify clinical and 
      echocardiographic risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: The study included 183 patients (93 
      males, 90 females; mean age 52+/-17 years) who had been on long-term hemodialysis 
      treatment (mean 41.6+/-39.8 months) and had preserved systolic function. Atrial 
      fibrillation was determined electrocardiographically and the patients were divided 
      into two groups depending on the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation. 
      Conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed on 
      interdialytic days. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were 
      compared. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (13.1%) had atrial fibrillation. Patients 
      with atrial fibrillation significantly differed in terms of higher age (64.9+/-9.8 
      vs. 49.9+/-16.6 years; p<0.001), higher frequency of coronary artery disease (37.5% 
      vs. 10.7%; p=0.008), and lower serum albumin level (3.6+/-0.4 vs. 3.9+/-0.5 mg/dl; 
      p=0.015). Echocardiographic examination showed significantly increased left and 
      right atrial diameters (p<0.05), higher incidence of mitral and/or aortic 
      calcification (p=0.033), increased systolic pulmonary artery pressure (38.1+/-6.1 
      vs. 28.5+/-5.5 mmHg, p<0.001) and E/E' ratio (11.8+/-3.8 vs. 8.8+/-4.7, p=0.008) in 
      patients with atrial fibrillation. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age 
      (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.00-1.17; p=0.036) and right atrial diameter (OR 1.19; 95% CI 
      1.05-1.35; p=0.008) were independent risk factors for the development of atrial 
      fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight age and right atrial diameter as 
      independent predictors of atrial fibrillation in hemodialysis patients. In addition, 
      the E/E' ratio and pulmonary artery pressure may be considered new risk factors of 
      atrial fibrillation in this population.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and fetuin A are independent predictors for the coronary 
      artery disease extent in mild chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1780-6
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02560310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by uremia-specific 
      factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors involved in its 
      regulation, and in the vascular calcification process. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In an unselected population of 177 patients with 
      calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), the link between the 
      mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product), 
      regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH], intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin A), and the severity of coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary angiography were evaluated in three 
      subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini lesion severity score. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population was 28.1 ± 17.3 RU/ml and for 
      fetuin A was 473.1 ± 156.2 μg/ml. Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had 
      significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; 
      arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. 
      After the adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk 
      factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini 
      score. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with 
      mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels 
      appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for 
      extent of CAD.

TI  - Rivaroxaban's Impact on Renal Decline in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation: A US MarketScan Claims Database Analysis.

AB  - Warfarin has been associated with renovascular calcification and worsening renal 
      function, whereas rivaroxaban may provide a degree of renopreservation by decreasing 
      vascular inflammation. We sought to compare rivaroxaban and warfarin's impact on 
      renal decline in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated in 
      routine practice. Using US MarketScan claims data from January 2012 to December 
      2017, we identified patients with NVAF newly initiated on rivaroxaban or warfarin 
      with ≥12 months of continuous insurance coverage prior to initiation. Patients with 
      stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or receiving hemodialysis at baseline were 
      excluded. Outcomes included rates (events/100 person-years) of hospital or emergency 
      department admission for acute kidney injury (AKI) or progression to stage 5 CKD or 
      need for hemodialysis. Differences in baseline covariates between cohorts were 
      adjusted using inverse probability-of-treatment weights based on propensity scores 
      (absolute standardized differences <0.1 achieved for all covariates after 
      adjustment). Patients were followed until an event, anticoagulant 
      discontinuation/switch, insurance disenrollment, or end of data availability. Hazard 
      ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression. We 
      assessed 36 318 rivaroxaban (19.8% received a dose <20 mg/d) and 36 281 warfarin 
      users. Stages 3 and 4 CKD were present in 5% and 1% of patients at baseline, and 
      proteinuria was present in 2%. Rivaroxaban was associated with a 19% (95% CI = 
      13%-25%) reduction in the hazard of AKI (rates = 4.91 vs 8.45) and an 18% (95% CI = 
      9%-26%) reduction in progression to stage 5 CKD or hemodialysis (rates = 2.67 vs 
      4.12). Rivaroxaban appears associated with lower hazards of undesirable renal end 
      points versus warfarin in patients with NVAF.

TI  - The GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism is associated with vascular calcifications in 
      nondiabetic uremic patients.
PG  - c182-7
LID - 10.1159/000118940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose transporters mediate the facilitative uptake of glucose into 
      cells, with GLUT-1 being the predominant isoform in vascular smooth muscle cell 
      (VSMC). Clones of human cells overexpressing the GLUT-1 transporter showed a high 
      increase in intracellular glucose concentrations, mimicking the diabetic milieu. It 
      is possible that high intracellular glucose together with uremic factors may play an 
      important role in vascular calcification by transforming VSMC into osteoblast-like 
      cells. The XbaI polymorphism in the GLUT-1 gene has been linked to variations in 
      GLUT-1 expression, with consequent changes in intracellular glucose concentration. 
      METHODS: To assess the association between the GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism and the 
      presence of VC in nondiabetic uremic patients, a total of 105 nondiabetic patients 
      on hemodialysis were studied. VC were evaluated by conventional simple X-ray. Mean 
      values of serum calcium, phosphorous, cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, PTH and 
      insulin were measured. Height, weight, BMI and waist circumference were also 
      determined. The GLUT-1 XbaI polymorphism in the second intron of the gene was 
      ascertained by means of the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment 
      length polymorphism analysis on DNA isolated from peripheral blood DNA. In the 
      absence of an XbaI site, a fragment of 305 bp was seen (so-called x allele), whereas 
      fragments of 232 and 73 bp were generated if the XbaI site was present (X allele). 
      RESULTS: Genotype distribution in all patients was similar to the Caucasian 
      population. However, when the patients were grouped according to the presence or 
      absence of VC, there were marked differences in the frequency of the GLUT1 
      genotypes: the xx GLUT-1 genotype was more prevalent in the group with VC (30.7 vs. 
      4.5%, p = 0.001). Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that the xx GLUT-1 
      genotype was independently associated with the presence of VC after adjusting for 
      other variables such as age, calcium x phosphrus product, BMI and time on dialysis 
      (OR 7.68; 95% CI 1.28-45.7). CONCLUSIONS: GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism is 
      associated with vascular calcifications in nondiabetic uremic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether the use of sevelamer rather than a calcium-containing phosphate 
      binder improves cardiovascular (CV) survival in patients receiving dialysis remains 
      to be elucidated. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label randomized controlled trial with parallel 
      groups. SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: 466 incident hemodialysis patients recruited from 
      18 centers in Italy. INTERVENTION: Study participants were randomly assigned in a 
      1:1 fashion to receive either sevelamer or a calcium-containing phosphate binder 
      (although not required by the protocol, all patients in this group received calcium 
      carbonate) for 24 months. OUTCOMES: All individuals were followed up until 
      completion of 36 months of follow-up or censoring. CV death due to cardiac 
      arrhythmias was regarded as the primary end point. MEASUREMENTS: Blind event 
      adjudication. RESULTS: At baseline, patients allocated to sevelamer had higher serum 
      phosphorus (mean, 5.6 ± 1.7 [SD] vs 4.8 ± 1.4 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein levels 
      (mean, 8.8 ± 13.4 vs 5.9 ± 6.8 mg/dL) and lower coronary artery calcification scores 
      (median, 19 [IQR, 0-30] vs 30 [IQR, 7-180]). At study completion, serum phosphate 
      levels were lower in the sevelamer arm (median dosages, 4,800 and 2,000 mg/d for 
      sevelamer and calcium carbonate, respectively). After a mean follow-up of 28 ± 10 
      months, 128 deaths were recorded (29 and 88 due to cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause 
      CV death). Sevelamer-treated patients experienced lower CV mortality due to cardiac 
      arrhythmias compared with patients treated with calcium carbonate (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 
      0.01-0.25; P < 0.001). Similar results were noted for all-cause CV mortality and 
      all-cause mortality, but not for non-CV mortality. Adjustments for potential 
      confounders did not affect results. LIMITATIONS: Open-label design, higher baseline 
      coronary artery calcification burden in calcium carbonate-treated patients, 
      different mineral metabolism control in sevelamer-treated patients, overall lower 
      than expected mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that sevelamer compared to 
      a calcium-containing phosphate binder improves survival in a cohort of incident 
      hemodialysis patients. However, the better outcomes in the sevelamer group may be 
      due to better phosphate control rather than reduction in calcium load.

TI  - Pentosidine in chronic hemodialysis patients: relation with arteriovenous fistula 
      morphology and function.
PG  - 1035-1042
LID - 10.1007/s11255-019-02151-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It has been suggested that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are 
      involved in atherogenesis, vascular calcification and remodeling, including 
      neointimal hyperplasia, in renal and non-renal patients. Their relevance for 
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) function has been poorly studied to date, with only one 
      clinical study addressing the issue of thrombosis of vascular access in relation to 
      AGEs in dialysis patients. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum 
      pentosidine and AVF morphology and function. METHODS: Eighty-eighth hemodialysis 
      patients with patent native AVF were included. Ultrasound examination of AVF 
      evaluated blood flow in the brachial artery, resistivity index (RI), the diameter of 
      the vessels and the presence of stenosis. AVF and cardiovascular history were 
      recorded, routine clinical and laboratory evaluation was performed and serum 
      pentosidine was assessed. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (54.54%) had AVF stenosis. 
      Pentosidine correlated in univariate analysis with cholesterol (r = 0.270, 
      p = 0.01), triglycerides (r = 0.309, p = 0.003), calcium (r = 0.040, p < 0.001) and 
      inversely to dialysis vintage (r = - 0.453, p < 0.001), access vintage (r = - 0.432, 
      p = 0.001), phosphate (r = - 0.211, p = 0.04), parathyroid hormone (r = - 0.211, 
      p = 0.04), urea (r = - 0.230, p = 0.03), residual diameter of AVF (r = - 0.023, 
      p = 0.03). In multivariate regression calcium (p = 0.006), access vintage 
      (p = 0.03), and residual diameter of AVF vein (p = 0.02) remain significantly linked 
      to pentosidine. Patients with pentosidine above median had higher cholesterol 
      (179.91 vs. 160.97, p = 0.04), triglycerides (187.18 vs. 129.31, p = 0.002) and 
      higher prevalence of hypertension (93.70% vs. 84.10%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggests that pentosidine could be associated to vascular access morphology 
      and function in dialysis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a cardiovascular risk 
      marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is known about its role in patients 
      with higher cardiovascular risk profile such as chronic kidney disease. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the relationship between EAT and several 
      cardiovascular surrogate markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial 
      stiffness and atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: A 
      total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional 
      study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography, arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and 
      carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode doppler ultrasonography. 
      RESULTS: Mean age was 59 ± 13 years and time on hemodialysis 75 ± 44 months. Twenty 
      percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean EAT volume was 62.6 ± 26.8 cm(3)/m(2). 
      Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased across the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated 
      with age, female gender, body mass index, albumin and lipid parameters. 
      Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values were positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume 
      was significantly higher in patients with CACs >10 compared to the patients with 
      CACs ≤10. Despite the univariate associations between EAT and cardiovascular 
      surrogate markers, only age, body mass index and total cholesterol levels were 
      associated with EAT in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: In prevalent hemodialysis 
      patients, EAT is correlated with atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the 
      presence of CAC. However, this correlation is not independent of other risk factors.

TI  - Plasma biomarkers improve prediction of diabetic kidney disease in adults with type 
      1 diabetes over a 12-year follow-up: CACTI study.
PG  - 1189-1196
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to determine whether plasma biomarkers of 
      kidney injury improve the prediction of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in adults with 
      type 1 diabetes (T1D) over a period of 12 years. METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% 
      females) in the Coronary Artery Calcification in T1D (CACTI) Study were examined 
      during 2002-04, at a mean (± standard deviation) age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years with 
      24.8 years as the median duration of diabetes. Urine albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by CKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease 
      epidemiology collaboration) creatinine were measured at the baseline and after mean 
      follow-up of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Albuminuria was defined as ACR ≥30 mg/g and impaired 
      GFR as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Kidney injury biomarkers (Meso Scale Diagnostics) 
      were measured on stored baseline plasma samples. A principal component analysis 
      (PCA) identified two components: (i) kidney injury molecule-1, calbindin, 
      osteoactivin, trefoil factor 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor; and (ii) β-2 
      microglobulin, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and 
      osteopontin that were used in the multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      Component 2 of the PCA was associated with increase in log modulus ACR [β ± standard 
      error (SE): 0.16 ± 0.07, P = 0.02] and eGFR (β ± SE: -2.56 ± 0.97, P = 0.009) over a 
      period of 12 years after adjusting for traditional risk factors (age, sex, HbA1c, 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure and baseline 
      eGFR/baseline ACR). Only Component 2 of the PCA was associated with 
      incident-impaired GFR (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.18-3.67, 
      P = 0.01), adjusting for traditional risk factors. The addition of Component 2 to 
      traditional risk factors significantly improved C-statistics and 
      net-reclassification improvement for incident-impaired GFR (ΔAUC: 0.02 ± 0.01, 
      P = 0.049, and 29% non-events correctly reclassified, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Plasma kidney injury biomarkers can help predict development of DKD in T1D.

TI  - Association of low fetuin-A (AHSG) concentrations in serum with cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients on dialysis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 827-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is the most prominent underlying pathological 
      finding in patients with uraemia, and is a predictor of mortality in this 
      population. Fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein; AHSG) is an important 
      circulating inhibitor of calcification in vivo, and is downregulated during the 
      acute-phase response. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that AHSG deficiency is 
      directly related to uraemic vascular calcification. METHODS: We did a 
      cross-sectional study in 312 stable patients on haemodialysis to analyse the 
      inter-relation of AHSG and C-reactive protein (CRP) and their predictive effect on 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, over a period of 32 months. Subsequently, we 
      tested the capacity of serum to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation in patients on 
      long-term dialysis (n=17) with apparent soft-tissue calcifications, and in those on 
      short-term dialysis (n=8) without evidence of calcifications and cardiovascular 
      disease. FINDINGS: AHSG concentrations in serum were significantly lower in patients 
      on haemodialysis (mean 0.66 g/L [SD 0.28]) than in healthy controls (0.72 [0.19]). 
      Low concentrations of the glycoprotein were associated with raised amounts of CRP 
      and with enhanced cardiovascular (p=0.031) and all-cause mortality (p=0.0013). Sera 
      from patients on long-term dialysis with low AHSG concentrations showed impaired 
      ex-vivo capacity to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation (mean IC50: 9.0 microL serum [SD 
      3.1] vs 7.5 [0.8] in short-term patients and 6.4 [2.6] in controls). Reconstitution 
      of sera with purified AHSG returned this impairment to normal. Interpretation AHSG 
      deficiency is associated with inflammation and links vascular calcification to 
      mortality in patients on dialysis. Activated acute-phase response and AHSG 
      deficiency might account for accelerated atherosclerosis in uraemia.

TI  - Circulating levels of cardiac troponin T are associated with coronary noncalcified 
      plaque burden in HIV-infected adults: a pilot study.
PG  - 223-230

AB  - HIV infection and/or antiretroviral therapy may increase the risk of subclinical 
      coronary atherosclerosis. However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      those without IV access cannot undergo contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography 
      (CCTA). This study was to explore the relationship between cardiac troponin T (cTnT) 
      levels and the extent of coronary plaque burden, as assessed by CCTA in those with 
      HIV infection. Between June and September 2017, 58 HIV-infected participants were 
      recruited and underwent contrast-enhanced CCTA. cTnT was measured with the Elecsys 
      Troponin T Gen 5 STAT assay, and noncalcified plaque burden was quantified using 
      coronary plaque analysis. Robust regression model was employed to perform primary 
      statistical analysis. Univariate robust regression analysis indicated that male 
      gender, cardiovascular risk score defined by the 2013 ACC/AHA cardiovascular risk 
      score algorithm, and cTnT levels were significantly associated with noncalcified 
      plaque volume index (NCPI). Final robust regression analyses showed that only cTnT 
      (log scale) was independently associated with the NCPI (regression coefficient: 
      0.0453 with 95% CI: 0.0151, 0.0755, p = 0.003). These results of this study suggest 
      that cTnT may be a promising marker for coronary plaque burden, especially in 
      patients with HIV-associated CKD or without IV access.

TI  - Recent advances in the noninvasive diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy.
PG  - 886-94
LID - 10.1038/ki.2013.254 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is the term used to 
      describe a constellation of biochemical abnormalities, bone disturbances that may 
      lead to fractures, and extraskeletal calcification in soft tissues and arteries seen 
      in CKD. This review focuses on the noninvasive diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy, 
      the term used exclusively to define the bone pathology associated with CKD. 
      Transiliac bone biopsy and histomorphometry with double-labeled tetracycline or its 
      derivatives remains the gold standard for diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy. 
      However, histomorphometry provides a 'window' into bone only at a single point in 
      time, and is not clinically practical for studying continuous changes in bone 
      morphology. Furthermore, the etiology of fractures in CKD is multifactorial and not 
      fully explained by histomorphometry findings alone. The propensity of a bone to 
      fracture is determined by bone strength, which is affected by bone mass and bone 
      quality; the latter is a term used to describe the structure and composition of 
      bone. Bone quantity is traditionally assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 
      CT-based methods. Bone quality is more difficult to assess noninvasively, but newer 
      techniques are emerging and are described in this review. Ultimately, the optimal 
      diagnostic strategy for renal osteodystrophy may be a combination of multiple 
      imaging techniques and biomarkers that are specific to each gender and race in CKD, 
      with a goal of predicting fracture risk and optimizing therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High serum phosphorus and the calcium-phosphorus product concentration 
      has been associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the 
      relationship between calcium-phosphorus product concentration and the presence of 
      coronary artery calcification in subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: 
      We reviewed the medical records of 2056 general subjects with a mean age of 55.1 ± 
      9.9 years and a glomerular filtration rate of 88.9 ± 16.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The 
      enrolled subjects consisted of 384 (18.7%) subjects with MetS and 1672 (81.3%) 
      subjects without MetS. The severity of coronary artery calcification was assessed by 
      the coronary artery calcification score (CACS) using multi-detector computed 
      tomography (MDCT). RESULTS: The CACS correlated with calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration in subjects with MetS (r = 0.184, P < 0.01). The odds ratio of 
      calcium-phosphorus product concentration having CACS >50 was 1.053 in subjects with 
      MetS (P < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, 
      calcium-phosphorus product concentrations had a positive correlation with CACS in 
      subjects with MetS. In single regression analysis, calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration as independent variable was the significant predictor of CACS in 
      subjects with MetS. Using a multivariate analysis, calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration remained a significant factor associated with CACS in subjects with 
      MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-phosphorus product concentration was weakly associated 
      with CACS and an independent factor predicting for CACS by MDCT in subjects with 
      MetS. These results suggest that calcium-phosphorus product concentration might be 
      considered as a risk factor of coronary artery disease in subjects with MetS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in dialysis (HD) 
      patients, and its mechanism is multifactorial. Most likely that systemic or local 
      inhibitory factor is overwhelmed by promoters of VC in these patients. VC increased 
      arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the present study aimed 
      to investigate the association of VC and myocardial remodeling and to analyze their 
      relationship with VC promoters (fibroblast growth factor 23-FGF23, Klotho, intact 
      parathormon-iPTH, vitamin D) in 56 prevalent HD patients (median values: age 54 yrs, 
      HD vintage 82 months). METHODS: Besides routine laboratory analyzes, serum levels of 
      FGF 23, soluble Klotho, iPTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; pulse wave velocity (PWV); 
      left ventricular (LV) mass by ultrasound; and VCs score by Adragao method were 
      measured. RESULTS: VC was found in 60% and LV concentric or eccentric hypertrophy in 
      50% patients. Dialysis vintage (OR 1.025, 95%CI 1.007-1.044, p=0.006) FGF23 (OR 
      1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.012, p=0.029) and serum magnesium (OR 0.000, 95%CI 
      0.000-0.214, p=0.04) were associated with VC. Changes in myocardial geometry was 
      associated with male sex (beta=-0.273, 95% CI -23.967 1.513, p=0.027), iPTH (beta 
      0.029, 95%CI -0.059-0.001, p=0.027) and vitamin D treatment (beta 25.49, 95%CI 
      11.325-39.667, p=0.001). Also, patients with the more widespread VC had the highest 
      LV remodeling categories. PWV was associated patient's age, cholesterol, diastolic 
      blood pressure, LV mass (positively) and serum calcium (negatively), indicating 
      potential link with atherosclerotic risk. CONCLUSIONS: Despite to different risk 
      factors for VC and myocardial remodeling, obtained results could indicate that risk 
      factors intertwine in long-term treatment of HD patients and therefore careful and 
      continuous correction of mineral metabolism disorders is undoubtedly of the utmost 
      importance.

TI  - Pre-treatment considerations in childhood hypertension due to chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 500-10
LID - 10.5527/wjn.v4.i5.500 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension (HTN) develops very early in childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD). It 
      is linked with rapid progression of kidney disease, increased morbidity and 
      mortality hence the imperative to start anti-hypertensive medication when blood 
      pressure (BP) is persistently > 90(th) percentile for age, gender, and height in 
      non-dialyzing hypertensive children with CKD. HTN pathomechanism in CKD is 
      multifactorial and complexly interwoven. The patient with CKD-associated HTN needs 
      to be carefully evaluated for co-morbidities that frequently alter the course of the 
      disease as successful treatment of HTN in CKD goes beyond life style modification 
      and anti-hypertensive therapy alone. Chronic anaemia, volume overload, endothelial 
      dysfunction, arterial media calcification, and metabolic derangements like secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphataemia, and calcitriol deficiency are a few 
      co-morbidities that may cause or worsen HTN in CKD. It is important to know if the 
      HTN is caused or made worse by the toxic effects of medications like erythropoietin, 
      cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
      Poor treatment response may be due to any of these co-morbidities and medications. A 
      satisfactory hypertensive CKD outcome, therefore, depends very much on identifying 
      and managing these co-morbid conditions and HTN promoting medications promptly and 
      appropriately. This review attempts to point attention to factors that may affect 
      successful treatment of the hypertensive CKD child and how to attain the desired 
      therapeutic BP target.

TI  - The prognosis of diabetic patients with high ankle-brachial index depends on the 
      coexistence of occlusive peripheral artery disease.
PG  - 984-91
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2010.10.054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: High ankle-brachial index (ABI) (>1.40) is associated with poor 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis. Concomittant peripheral artery disease (PAD) 
      is frequent, although undetectable with the ABI in this situation. We assessed the 
      prognostic value of a high ABI according to the coexistence of occlusive PAD in 
      diabetics. METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study, we reviewed the data 
      of 403 consecutive diabetic patients (hospitalized in tertiary care teaching 
      hospital) who had a Doppler assessment of their lower limbs between 1999 and 2000. 
      They were classified as "normal" when Doppler waveform patterns (DWP) were normal 
      and ABI within the 0.91 to 1.39 range, "occlusive-PAD (O-PAD)" when ABI ≤0.90, or in 
      case of abnormal DWP with normal ABI, "isolated medial calcinosis (IMC)" if ABI 
      ≥1.40 with normal DWP, and "mixed disease (MD)" when ABI ≥1.40 with abnormal DWP. 
      The primary outcome was the occurrence of any of the following events: death, stroke 
      or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and acute coronary syndrome. RESULTS: The 
      patients (65.6 ± 13.2 years, 54.6% females) were classified as normal (14.4%), O-PAD 
      (48.4%), IMC (16.4%), and MD (20.8%). During a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, the 
      event-free survival curves of O-PAD and MD groups showed equally poorer prognosis 
      than the IMC and normal groups. Adjusted for age, sex, diabetes type and duration, 
      traditional CVD risk factors, chronic kidney disease, CVD history and treatments, 
      the presence of occlusive disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.21, 1.16-4.22, P = .016), 
      but not medial calcinosis, was significantly associated with the primary outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In diabetics with ABI >1.40, only those with concommittant occlusive 
      PAD have poorer prognosis.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk markers associated with arterial calcification in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 167-173
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of pro-inflammatory markers to cardiovascular (CV) risk 
      and vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains largely to be 
      elucidated. We investigated the association between plasma levels of several 
      biomarkers and calcification volume in three different vascular beds in CKD Stages 3 
      and 4 patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, exploratory study in patients 
      with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥20 and ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 
      serum phosphorus ≥3.5 and <6.0 mg/dL enrolled in a previously published randomized, 
      double blind, placebo-controlled single-centre trial. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
      acid (EDTA) plasma samples were collected at baseline before patients received study 
      medication and analysed for the presence of a number of biomarkers. Coronary artery 
      calcium (CAC), thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) and abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) volumes were measured using standard electron-beam computed 
      tomography protocols. Associations were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, body mass 
      index, diabetes mellitus status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 
      systolic blood pressure and eGFR. RESULTS: Associations with CAC were found for 
      β2-microglobulin (B2M), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), interleukin-8 (IL-8) 
      and IL-18. AAC was associated with: B2M, FGF23 and IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2 RA). 
      TAC was associated with: B2M, FGF23, IL-2 RA, IL-18 and tumour necrosis factor 
      receptor type I. For most of the analysed biomarkers, there were non-significant 
      trends of associations with calcification. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found 
      that elevated plasma levels of several inflammatory biomarkers are significantly 
      associated with arterial calcification in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. A greater 
      understanding of inflammation and calcification in CKD patients may help the 
      development of CV risk-assessment algorithms for better management of these 
      patients.

TI  - Bone Mineral Density and Aortic Calcification: Evidence for a Bone-vascular Axis 
      After Kidney Transplantation.
PG  - 231-239
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000003226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) and vascular 
      calcification are often seen in kidney transplantation recipients (KTR). This study 
      focused on the bone-vascular axis hypothesis, the pathophysiological mechanisms 
      driving both bone loss and vascular calcification, supported by an association 
      between lower bone mineral density (BMD) and higher risk of vascular calcification. 
      METHODS: KTR referred for a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry procedure within 6 mo 
      after transplantation were included in a cross-sectional study (2004-2014). Areal 
      BMD was measured at the proximal femur, and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was 
      quantified (8-points score) from lateral single-energy images of the lumbar spine. 
      Patients were divided into 3 AAC categories (negative-AAC: AAC 0; low-AAC: AAC 1-3; 
      and high-AAC: AAC 4-8). Multivariable-adjusted multinomial logistic regression 
      models were performed to study the association between BMD and AAC. RESULTS: We 
      included 678 KTR (51 ± 13 y old, 58% males), 366 (54%) had BMD disorders, and 266 
      (39%) had detectable calcification. High-AAC was observed in 9%, 11%, and 25% of KTR 
      with normal BMD, osteopenia, and osteoporosis, respectively (P < 0.001). Higher BMD 
      (T-score, continuous) was associated with a lower risk of high-AAC (odds ratio 0.61, 
      95% confidence interval 0.42-0.88; P = 0.008), independent of age, sex, body mass 
      index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and immunosuppressive therapy. KTR with 
      normal BMD were less likely to have high-AAC (odds ratio 0.24, 95% confidence 
      interval 0.08-0.72; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: BMD disorders are highly prevalent in 
      KTR. The independent inverse association between BMD and AAC may provide evidence to 
      point toward the existence, while highlighting the clinical and epidemiological 
      relevance, of a bone-vascular axis after kidney transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate population-based cardiovascular risk scores and coronary 
      artery calcification scores (CACS) in amputees. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study 
      of 1300 veterans in a cardiac computed tomography database. SETTING: 1B Veterans 
      Administration medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 76 amputees and similar 
      number of age-, gender-, and Framingham Risk Scores (FRS)-matched control subjects. 
      METHODS: The amputee population was identified and compared for CACS and traditional 
      cardiac risk factors. Two control groups were used: control group 1, with known risk 
      factors including diabetes mellitus, and control group 2, with all risk factors 
      without diabetes mellitus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical associations between 
      amputee and control group FRS scores, CACS, and other cardiac risk factors were 
      assessed. RESULTS: The study included 57 nontraumatic and 19 traumatic amputees with 
      an average age of 62.4 years. Sixty-six amputees were in the low-to-intermediate 
      cardiac risk groups according to FRS. Despite this classification, the mean CACS 
      were significantly higher in amputees (1285 ± 18) than in either of the control 
      groups: control group 1 (540 ± 84) and control group 2 (481 ± 11), P < .001. CACS 
      also were significantly higher in the nontraumatic subject group (1595 ± 12) 
      compared with the traumatic group (356 ± 57; P < .001). Upon categorization of CACS 
      based on probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), 76% of amputees had a CACS 
      >100 and 38% of amputees had a CACS >1000. Interestingly, CACS were almost the same 
      in finger/toe amputations compared with an above-knee amputation, indicating an 
      already ongoing CAD process irrespective of level of amputation. The predominant 
      clinical significant cardiac risk factors in amputees are hypertension (89.5%), P < 
      .005; chronic kidney disease (31.6%), P < .001; dyslipidemia (72.4%), P < .04; and 
      insulin resistance. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density 
      lipoprotein levels were nonsignificantly low in all amputees. Triglycerides were 
      particularly higher in traumatic patients compared with nontraumatic patients, with 
      the triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio >7. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that amputees have a much greater burden of underlying atherosclerotic 
      disease as detected by CACS than do control subjects matched by Framingham risk 
      stratification. Early screening for CAD and aggressive targeted interventions may be 
      an important part of management to reduce early mortality after amputation.

AB  - Coronary artery calcifications are always challenging scenarios for interventional 
      cardiologists. Calcium content in coronary tree directly correlates with male sex, 
      age, Caucasian ethnicity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Intracoronary 
      imaging is useful and necessary to understand calcific lesion features and plan the 
      best percutaneous coronary intervention strategy. Thus, accurate evaluation of 
      patient and lesion characteristics is crucial. For this reason, definition of 
      calcific arc, length, and thickness can suggest the best procedure before stenting 
      and final optimization. In our modern era, different devices are available and all 
      are surprisingly promising.

TI  - Diffuse dermal angiomatosis associated with calciphylaxis: A 5-year retrospective 
      institutional review.
PG  - 27-30
LID - 10.1111/cup.13585 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although diffuse dermal angiomatosis (DDA), a rare acquired reactive 
      cutaneous vascular disorder, has been previously reported in association with 
      calciphylaxis (CP), the clinical significance of this relationship has not yet been 
      elucidated. METHODS: A total of 24 cases of CP diagnosed from 2013 to 2018 were 
      retrospectively reviewed for the presence of associated DDA. Pertinent clinical 
      information for each patient was also collected, and statistical analysis was 
      performed using multivariable logistic regression, Student t test and Fisher exact 
      test. RESULTS: African American race and comorbid congestive heart failure were the 
      only variables that demonstrated independent, statistically significant association 
      with the presence of DDA. End-stage renal failure, diabetes mellitus, 
      immunosuppressive and hypercoagulable states, arrhythmia, body mass index, 
      hypertension, coronary artery disease, patient age, duration of CP symptoms, gender, 
      time interval from biopsy to death, anticoagulation therapy and sodium thiosulfate 
      administration at the time of biopsy did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
      association with DDA. CONCLUSION: DDA does not appear to be associated with disease 
      severity or prognosis in cases of CP; however, in our population CP with concurrent 
      DDA was more prevalent in African Americans and individuals with congestive heart 
      failure.

TI  - Vitamin D: a possible modifying factor linking obesity to vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s12986-017-0181-7 [doi]
LID - 27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for increased cardiovascular disease. Whether 
      vitamin D deficiency modifies this association is unclear. Here, we examined the 
      association of obesity and vitamin D deficiency with vascular calcification score 
      (VCS) in incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted with 213 ESRD patients. Vitamin D deficiency was 
      defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels below 10 ng/mL, and obesity 
      was defined as a percentage of body fat (PBF) higher than the sex-specific median 
      value in the cohort (>26.8% for men, >36.2% for women). VCS was measured by plain 
      radiographic film of the lateral abdomen in the standing position. RESULTS: Most 
      ESRD patients (76.6%) had 25(OH)D deficiency at the start of dialysis. The 
      prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency was much higher in obese patients than non-obese 
      patients, and it had significant inverse association with PBF (r = -0.315, 
      p < 0.001). Abdominal aortic calcification was identified in 104 (48.9%) patients. 
      VCS was significantly higher in obese population; 2.6 (0-23) for all patients, 4.2 
      (0-23) for obese and 1.0 (0-12) for non-obese patients (p < 0.001). Interestingly, 
      vitamin D deficiency was associated with greater risk of a high VCS, especially in 
      obese population [odds ratio (OR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-9.38)], 
      but not with non-obese patients (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.56-5.60). CONCLUSION: The 
      magnitude and direction of the association between obesity and the risk of vascular 
      calcification may depend on an individual's 25(OH)D level, a possible representative 
      marker of cardiometabolic disturbance in ESRD patients.

      (PTH1-34): A Pilot Study.
PG  - 221-6
LID - 10.1159/000316708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adynamic bone disease (ABD) is caused by a relative or absolute 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency. Teriparatide (PTH1-34) is an osteoanabolic 
      agent in clinical use. Here, it was hypothesized that treatment with teriparatide 
      improves bone mineral density (BMD) of ABD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven 
      hemodialysis patients with ABD and a median iPTH level of 22 pg/ml were evaluated in 
      this open-label, prospective, 6-month observational pilot-study. All patients 
      received 20 μg teriparatide/day subcutaneously. Serologic bone markers, BMD and 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) were measured at baseline and after 6 months. 
      RESULTS: Teriparatide therapy led to a significant increase in lumbar spine (0.885 ± 
      0.08 vs. 0.914 ± 0.09 g/cm(2), p < 0.02), but not femoral neck (0.666 ± 0.170 vs. 
      0.710 ± 0.189 g/cm(2), p = 0.18) BMD. Compared to pretreatment values, calculated 
      monthly changes in BMD improved significantly in both the lumbar spine and femoral 
      neck (p < 0.02). Changes in serologic markers of bone turnover and CAC scores were 
      not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Teriparatide therapy might improve low 
      BMD in hemodialysis patients with ABD. Further clinical studies are needed to 
      establish teriparatide as a therapeutic option for dialysis patients with ABD.

TI  - Increased Prevalence and Severity of Coronary Artery Calcification in Patients with 
      Chronic Kidney Disease Stage III and IV.
PG  - 192-204
LID - 10.1159/000339786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of mortality in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The pathophysiology of coronary artery disease in 
      CKD is multifactorial including, in addition to traditional risk factors 
      (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus), parameters related to uremia. 
      METHODS: The study consisted of measuring coronary artery calcification (CAC) score 
      in patients with CKD stage III and IV without history of CVD and in a group of 
      controls with normal renal function matched for age, gender and risk factors using 
      multi-detector computed tomography. RESULTS: The study included 49 patients and 49 
      controls. CAC was present in 79.6% in the CKD group versus 59.2% in the control 
      group (p = 0.028). The median CAC score value in CKD patients was 139 (interquartile 
      range (IQR): 23-321) versus 61 (IQR: 6-205) in controls (p = 0.007). CAC was 
      associated with traditional risk factors such as older age, hypertension and 
      baseline cardiovascular risk score, while CKD patients with severe calcification had 
      marginally lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and increased levels of 
      parathormone. CONCLUSIONS: CAC is more frequent and severe in patients with CKD 
      stage III and IV compared to matched controls with normal renal function, even 
      though kidney disease-related parameters are not directly correlated with intensity 
      of calcification.

TI  - Association of fetuin-A levels with the progression of aortic valve calcification in 
      non-dialyzed patients.
PG  - 2054-61
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehp158 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fetuin-A has been identified as a potent circulating inhibitor of ectopic 
      calcification. We investigated the relationship between baseline fetuin-A serum 
      levels and the rate of progression of aortic valve calcification (AVC) in 
      non-dialyzed patients with aortic valve disease (AVD). METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Seventy-seven patients (mean age 70 +/- 8 years) with echocardiographically proven 
      AVD were collected. In all patients, serum fetuin-A levels, creatinine, calcium, 
      lipid parameters, and C-reactive protein were measured at baseline. For 
      quantification of AVC progression, all patients underwent multislice spiral computed 
      tomography examinations at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 12.6 +/- 1.4 
      months (range 7-18 months). In a multifactorial analysis of covariance including 
      fetuin-A levels, baseline AVC score, the covariables sex, age, body mass index, 
      C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, serum lipids, diabetes, smoking 
      status, and hypertension, only serum fetuin-A levels significantly predict the 
      progression of AVC (P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis demonstrated that patients with 
      baseline fetuin-A levels lower than the median of the cohort (0.72 g/L) showed a 
      significantly higher increase of AVC scores (34.6 +/- 31.4%) than patients with 
      fetuin-A levels larger than the median (10.0 +/- 11.2%, P < 0.001) despite 
      comparable baseline AVC scores. In addition, fetuin-A levels were associated with 
      major adverse clinical events (MACE; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Serum levels of the 
      calcification inhibitor fetuin-A are associated with the progression of AVC and 
      MACE, independent of the renal function and inflammation.

TI  - Serum indoxyl sulfate is associated with vascular disease and mortality in chronic 
      kidney disease patients.
PG  - 1551-8
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03980609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a major component of uremic syndrome, cardiovascular 
      disease is largely responsible for the high mortality observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have evidenced an association between serum 
      levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and vascular 
      alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum 
      IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a cohort of CKD 
      patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: One-hundred and thirty-nine 
      patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at different stages of CKD (8% at 
      stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at stage 5, and 32% at stage 5D) 
      were enrolled. RESULTS: Baseline IS levels presented an inverse relationship with 
      renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification and pulse wave 
      velocity. During the follow-up period (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly 
      because of cardiovascular events (n = 18). In crude survival analyses, the highest 
      IS tertile was a powerful predictor of overall and cardiovascular mortality (P = 
      0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The predictive power of IS for death was maintained 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, albumin, hemoglobin, phosphate, and 
      aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here indicates that IS may 
      have a significant role in the vascular disease and higher mortality observed in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Altered Mineral Metabolism and Disequilibrium Between Calcification Promoters and 
      Inhibitors in Chronic Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1007/s12011-019-01685-8 [doi]
AB  - Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (HD) are known to have abnormal blood 
      concentrations of antioxidant minerals; concurrent oxidative stress can contribute 
      to increased vascular calcification. This study aims to evaluate the associations 
      between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of vascular 
      calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant minerals 
      (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and several promoters 
      and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP), fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9), and tissue inhibitors 
      of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in HD patients (n = 62) and 
      age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 30). Compared with healthy subjects, 
      HD patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu 
      and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn 
      ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that HD patients had significantly lower 
      concentrations of MGP and higher levels of FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and 
      MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios. We also observed significant relationships 
      between the concentrations of these minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD 
      patients. These results suggest that changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant 
      minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and 
      inflammatory status, thereby participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing long-term HD.

TI  - Vascular calcifications in uremia: old concepts and new insights.
PG  - 60-8
AB  - The annual mortality rate in uremic patients, corrected for age, sex, and race, is 
      significantly higher than in the general population. This is primarily due to 
      cardiovascular events. Vascular calcifications play a vital role in the development 
      of cardiovascular morbidity and subsequent increased mortality. Vascular 
      calcification affects both vascular intima and media layers and its mechanism 
      remains poorly understood. Over the last few years it has been shown that, in 
      addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, disturbances in mineral 
      metabolism in the uremic milieu, calcium-containing phosphate binders, and vitamin D 
      treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
      vascular calcifications. Other uremia-related risk factors (e.g.increased oxidized 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uremic toxins, increased oxidative stress, 
      dialysis and dialysate-related factors, hemodynamic overload, hyperhomocysteinemia) 
      may also play a role. In uremic patients, apart from these facilitating factors, 
      decreased levels of endogenous calcification inhibitors such as fetuin-Amatrix Gla 
      protein, osteoprotegerin, and osteopontin have also been associated with increased 
      calcium-phosphate precipitation in extraskeletal tissues. Finally, vascular 
      calcification is the outcome of the active and dynamic balance of procalcifying and 
      anticalcifying influences. For the prevention and treatment of vascular 
      calcifications, it is essential to avoid treatment modalities that lead to calcium 
      overload, achieve good metabolic control, and optimize dialysis.

PG  - 1965-1973
LID - 10.1007/s00198-020-05423-y [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder suggests that fragile bone 
      and vascular disorder might be connected closely in CKD patients. In this study, 
      fracture event was significantly associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in 
      end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (HD), especially for vertebral 
      fractures. INTRODUCTION: CKD-mineral and bone disorder is characterized by 
      biochemical abnormalities, bone disorders, and vascular calcification. We aimed to 
      verify the association between fracture and MI in CKD patients. METHODS: Records for 
      incident CKD stage 3 to 5 patients and patients who initiated HD between July 2014 
      and June 2018 were retrieved from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment 
      Service Database. Fractures were defined using diagnostic codes and were classified 
      into vertebral, femoral, and other site fractures. MI was defined using a 
      combination of MI diagnostic codes and related procedure codes. Multiple logistic 
      regressions and 1:1 propensity score matching analysis were conducted. RESULTS: A 
      total of 38,935 patients (HD, 11,379; pre-dialysis CKD, 27,556) were included in 
      this study. A total of 5,057 (13.0%) patients experienced fracture, and 1,431 (3.7%) 
      patients had MI. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that fracture was 
      significantly associated with MI in the HD group (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, P = 0.024), 
      but not in the pre-dialysis CKD group (OR 1.04, P = 0.701). After propensity score 
      matching for age, gender, and diabetes mellitus between patients with and without 
      fracture, fracture still significantly correlated with MI in HD patients (OR 1.47, 
      P = 0.034) but not in patients with pre-dialysis CKD (OR 1.04, P = 0.751). Subgroup 
      analysis by fracture site found that vertebral fracture was associated with MI in HD 
      patients (OR 2.11, P = 0.024), but femoral or other site fractures were not. 
      CONCLUSION: In HD patients, fracture was significantly associated with MI, 
      especially for vertebral fractures patients.

      patients is growing but few data are available about their bone disorders. 
      OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of CKD-MBD in Senegalese dialysis patients. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including patients from 
      three dialysis centres in Senegal. Diagnosis of different types of CKD-MBD relied on 
      clinical, biological and radiological data collected from medical records in 
      dialysis. RESULTS: We included 118 patients and 79 of them presented CKD-BMD 
      (prevalence of was 66.9 %). Mean age of CKD-MBD patients was 47.8 ± 15.7 years 
      (16-81 years) and sex-ratio (Male/Female) was 1.15. Secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      was the most frequent disorder (57 patients) followed by adynamic bone disease (21 
      patients) and osteomalacia (1 patients). The main clinical manifestations were bone 
      pain (17.5% of cases), pruritus (36.8% of cases) and pathological fractures (2.5% of 
      cases). Bone biopsy was not available. Valvular and peripheral vascular 
      calcification were present in 24.5% and 21.2% of patients respectively. Management 
      of CKD-MBD included optimization of dialysis, calcium bicarbonate, sevelamer, 
      vitamin D analogues and calcimimetics. The NKF/DOQI recommended levels of serum 
      calcium, phosphate and parathormone PTH were not achieved in one third of patients. 
      Six patients presented major cardiovascular events during their dialysis period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CKD-MBD are frequent in Senegalese hemodialysis patients and they are 
      dominated by high turn-over disease. Clinical and biological manifestations are 
      unspecific and accurate diagnoses are often difficult in absence of 
      histomorphometry. Treatment is suboptimal for many patients in a context of limited 
      resources.

PG  - 1717-1722
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2016060651 [doi]
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. The 
      ability of MGP to inhibit calcification requires the activity of a vitamin 
      K-dependent enzyme, which mediates MGP carboxylation. We investigated how MGP 
      carboxylation influences the risk of calciphylaxis in adult patients receiving 
      dialysis and examined the effects of vitamin K deficiency on MGP carboxylation. Our 
      study included 20 patients receiving hemodialysis with calciphylaxis (cases) and 20 
      patients receiving hemodialysis without calciphylaxis (controls) matched for age, 
      sex, race, and warfarin use. Cases had higher plasma levels of uncarboxylated MGP 
      (ucMGP) and carboxylated MGP (cMGP) than controls. However, the fraction of total 
      MGP that was carboxylated (relative cMGP concentration = cMGP/[cMGP + uncarboxylated 
      MGP]) was lower in cases than in controls (0.58±0.02 versus 0.69±0.03, respectively; 
      P=0.003). In patients not taking warfarin, cases had a similarly lower relative cMGP 
      concentration. Each 0.1 unit reduction in relative cMGP concentration associated 
      with a more than two-fold increase in calciphylaxis risk. Vitamin K deficiency 
      associated with lower relative cMGP concentration in multivariable adjusted analyses 
      (β=-8.99; P=0.04). In conclusion, vitamin K deficiency-mediated reduction in 
      relative cMGP concentration may have a role in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis. 
      Whether vitamin K supplementation can prevent and/or treat calciphylaxis requires 
      further study.

      radiographs and medical conditions.
PG  - 235-244

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe radiographic characteristics and the 
      prevalence of selected anatomical structures and soft tissue radiopacities on 
      panoramic radiographs and their relationship to medical conditions. METHODS: A 
      retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with 814 consecutive patients aged 
      35-88 years and their panoramic radiographs. Soft tissue calcifications found in the 
      mandibular angle area were recorded according to gender, age, and bilaterally. 
      Patient medical records were reviewed for atherogenic risk factors including 
      hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic renal disease, menopause, drug usage 
      and any other systemic condition. Data were analyzed with the χ<sup>2</sup> test and 
      Fisher's Exact test; P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among 
      the 814 patients, a total of 74 (9.1%) calcified carotid artery atheromas (CCAA) 
      were identified, of which 34 (4.17%), 40 (3.19%), and 14 (1.7%) were right, left, 
      and bilateral, respectively. Orthopantomographic examination revealed triticeous 
      cartilage (7.3%) in the cervical bifurcation region, asymptomatic styloid process 
      elongation 192 (23.5%), tonsilloliths 27 (3.3%), sialoliths 37 (4.5%), calcified 
      lymph nodes 46 (5.7%), impacted roots 109 (13.4%), and foreign radiopaque materials 
      23 (%2.8). There was a significant age and gender difference between type II 
      diabetes and CCAA. A positive correlation was found between styloid process 
      elongation and temporomandibular joint disorders and antidepressant use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue radiopacities can be a validated risk indicator of 
      cardiovascular events or misdiagnosed pain. Dental practitioners must be aware of 
      these atypical findings as they may be related to serious disease states and may 
      require referral for further investigation.

TI  - Effects of SNF472, a Novel Inhibitor of Hydroxyapatite Crystallization in Patients 
      Receiving Hemodialysis - Subgroup Analyses of the CALIPSO Trial.
PG  - 2178-2182
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2020.09.032 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is highly prevalent and linked with poor 
      outcomes in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and its reduction may 
      improve patient prognosis. SNF472, a selective inhibitor of hydroxyapatite 
      crystallization, slows CAC progression in patients receiving maintenance 
      hemodialysis. In this analysis, we assessed the efficacy of SNF472 in prespecified 
      patient subgroups. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial SNF472 300 mg, SNF472 600 
      mg, or placebo were infused thrice weekly in 91, 92, and 91 patients receiving 
      maintenance hemodialysis and with CAC at baseline, respectively. In prespecified 
      subanalyses, the percent change in CAC volume score (CACvs) from baseline to week 52 
      in modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations was 
      calculated in the following subgroups: age, sex, diabetes mellitus, dialysis 
      vintage, prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, baseline use of non-calcium 
      and calcium-based phosphate binders, calcimimetics, activated vitamin D, warfarin, 
      and statins. RESULTS: In the main trial, SNF472 significantly reduced CACvs 
      progression compared with placebo (11% versus 20% mITT analyses; P = 0.016; 8% vs. 
      24% PP analyses; P < 0.001). Treatment differences for CACvs progression were 
      similar across all subgroups, and all interaction P values were non-significant in 
      mITT and PP analyses. CONCLUSIONS: SNF472 treatment for 52 weeks reduced CACvs 
      progression compared with placebo in a broad range of patients receiving maintenance 
      hemodialysis. Future studies will determine the impact of SNF472 on cardiovascular 
      events in this population.

TI  - Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by-stander, 
      but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in 
      vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline 
      phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
      RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
      were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
      phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with 
      older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher 
      serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone 
      levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but 
      the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate 
      time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of serum alkaline 
      phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone 
      metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase 
      was significantly associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 
      95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 
      1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in 
      hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. 
      Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis 
      patients.

AB  - Insufficient control of serum calcium and phosphate levels in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis is associated with increased mortality. As commonly used 
      calcium-containing phosphate binders can cause arterial calcification, newly 
      developed calcium-free phosphate binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) and 
      lanthanum carbonate (LC), have received much attention. We assessed the efficacy and 
      safety of SH and LC treatment in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis in a 
      prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover study. Forty-two 
      patients were randomized to receive SH or LC for 13 weeks, with the dosages adjusted 
      every 2 weeks, followed by treatment with the other drug for another 13 weeks. The 
      average daily doses of SH and LC were 2971 ± 1464 mg and 945 ± 449 mg, respectively. 
      The mean dosage ratio of SH to LC was 3.05, which was maintained throughout the 
      treatment period. SH and LC were similarly effective at controlling serum calcium 
      and phosphate levels in the majority of patients (78-93%). A few serious adverse 
      events (AEs) involving the biliary system occurred during the LC treatment period, 
      but they were not considered to be treatment-induced. Although the incidence of 
      constipation, the most common treatment-related AE, was higher during the SH period 
      (27% vs. 5%; P < 0.05), no difference was observed in total treatment-related AEs. 
      This study demonstrates that SH and LC are comparable treatments for controlling 
      serum phosphate and calcium levels, and that both compounds are safe and 
      well-tolerated in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), known to regulate bone mass by 
      inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation, might also play a role in 
      vascular calcification. Increased circulating OPG levels in patients with CKD are 
      associated with aortic calcification and increased mortality. We assessed the 
      predictive role of OPG for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
      CKD stages 3-5 over a 5-year follow-up period. We evaluated the relationship between 
      OPG and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 145 CKD patients (stages 3-5) in a 
      prospective observational follow-up study. Inflammation markers, including 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, standard echocardiography, and estimation of 
      intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery, were assessed at baseline, and 
      correlations with OPG levels were determined. The cutoff values for OPG were defined 
      using ROC curves for cardiovascular mortality. Survival was assessed during follow 
      up lasting for up to 5.5 years using Fine and Gray model. A total of 145 (89 men; 
      age 58.9 ± 15.0 years) were followed up. The cutoff value for OPG determined using 
      ROC was 10 pmol/L for general causes mortality and 10.08 pmol/L for CV causes 
      mortality. Patients with higher serum OPG levels presented with higher mortality 
      rates compared to patients with lower levels. Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence 
      curve analysis demonstrated significantly worse survival rates in individuals with 
      higher baseline OPG levels for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (p < 0.001). 
      In multivariate analysis, OPG was a marker of general and cardiovascular mortality 
      independent of sex, age, CVD, diabetes, and CRP levels. When CKD stages were 
      included in the multivariate analysis, OPG was an independent marker of all-cause 
      mortality but not cardiovascular mortality. Elevated serum OPG levels were 
      associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of 
      age, CVD, diabetes, and inflammatory markers, in patients with CKD.

TI  - Correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 15745-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. 
      According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 ηg/ml or less than 30 ηg/ml) and 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (>30 ηg/ml). All of the subjects underwent 
      lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree of 
      calcification (Kauppila score). RESULTS: Among the 126 patients treated with MHD, 
      there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients with 
      normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no significant difference found in 
      gender, age, age of dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood 
      phosphorus, blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the 
      two groups. The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with 
      normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had a 
      negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P = 0.193). Logistic 
      regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor for vascular 
      calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is generally low in 
      patients with MHD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a 
      higher incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative correlation. 
      Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D deficiency should be actively 
      treated.

TI  - The relationship between coronary artery calcification and bone mineral density in 
      patients according to their metabolic syndrome status.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.4070/kcj.2011.41.2.76 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is 
      closely related to total atherosclerotic plaque burden. However, the pathogenesis of 
      CAC is still unclear. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, smoking, 
      and chronic inflammation have been suggested to link vascular calcification and bone 
      loss. In the present study, we hypothesized that bone loss can contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of CAC in patients with the chronic inflammatory condition that 
      accompanies metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study was to 
      investigate the relationship between CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients 
      with MetS and in patients without MetS, by using coronary multidetector-row computed 
      tomography (MDCT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from 395 consecutive patients was 
      analyzed retrospectively. From the MDCT database, only those patients who underwent 
      both coronary MDCT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry within an interval of one 
      month, were selected. The presence of MetS was determined by the updated criteria as 
      defined by the Third Adult Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol 
      Education Program. RESULTS: In patients with MetS, a significant correlation was 
      found between CAC and age {odds ratio (OR)=1.139, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.080 
      to 1.201, p<0.001}, CAC and male sex (OR=3.762, 95% CI 1.339 to 10.569, p=0.012), 
      and CAC and T-score of L-spine (OR=0.740, 95% CI 0.550 to 0.996, p=0.047) using a 
      forward multiple logistic regression analysis model including clinical variables of 
      gender, age, lipid profile, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
      smoking, and BMD. But in patients without MetS, BMD by itself was not found to 
      contribute to CAC. CONCLUSION: BMD was inversely correlated with CAC only in 
      patients with MetS. This finding suggests that low BMD accompanied by MetS, may have 
      significant clinical implications.

TI  - Serum myostatin levels are associated with abdominal aortic calcification in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 481-489
LID - 10.23876/j.krcp.19.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum myostatin levels are increased according to renal function decline 
      and myostatin may be a main mediator of chronic kidney disease-related sarcopenia. A 
      previous study reported that serum myostatin level was negatively associated with 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older males. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the association between serum myostatin level and AAC among dialysis patients 
      of both sexes. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between serum myostatin 
      level, muscle mass, and bone mineral density (BMD). METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, we evaluated AAC in the lateral lumbar spine using plain radiography and BMD 
      in 71 patients undergoing dialysis. We classified patients into two groups according 
      to the median value of myostatin as follows: those with high myostatin levels (≥ 5.0 
      ng/mL) and those with low myostatin levels (< 5.0 ng/mL). RESULTS: The proportion of 
      patients with an AAC score of five points or more was higher among those with low 
      myostatin levels. Myostatin level was negatively associated with AAC scores on plain 
      radiography and had a positive association with skeletal muscle mass and T-scores 
      for BMD measured at the total hip and femur neck. Lower myostatin levels were 
      independently associated with higher AAC scores following adjustment for age, sex, 
      diabetes mellitus, dialysis vintage, dialysis modality, and osteoprotegerin level. 
      CONCLUSION: Lower serum myostatin levels were associated with higher AAC scores, 
      lower muscle mass, and lower BMD in dialysis patients. Further, prospective studies 
      and those with larger cohorts are necessary to validate these findings.

TI  - Rotational atherectomy in very long lesions: Results for the ROTATE registry.
PG  - E164-E172
LID - 10.1002/ccd.26548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotational atherectomy (RA) is relatively contraindicated in patients 
      with lesions ≥25 mm of length. Aim of this study was to evaluate RA safety and 
      efficacy in this subset of patients with new technology and devices. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: From April 2002 to August 2013, the ROTATE registry included all 
      consecutive patients undergoing RA in 8 centres. They were divided into shorter 
      lesion group (SLG, lesions < 25 mm) and longer lesion group (LLG, lesions ≥ 25 mm). 
      The angiographic success (AS) was the primary end point. Procedural complications 
      (PC), a composite end point of procedural perforation, slow flow/no flow, and 
      in-hospital major acute cardiovascular events (MACE), were secondary end points, 
      along with death, nonfatal MI, target lesion revascularization, and MACE during 
      follow-up. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to generation of DES. 1186 
      patients were included: 51.5% in SLG and 48.4% in LLG. Mean age was 70.4 ± 9.3 
      years, 64.5% were male. AS and PC did not differ between the two groups (93% vs 91%, 
      p = 0.24 and 9.8 vs 9.4%, p = 0.84). During follow-up (27.6 ± 22.9 months), MACE did 
      not differ between the two groups (28% vs 29.1%, p = 0.95). At multivariate analysis 
      chronic kidney disease, male gender increased risk of MACE (HR 1.94, IQR 1.29-2.0, 
      p = 0.01, HR 0.52, IQR 0.34-0.79, p = 0.01) while second-generation DES seemed 
      protective (HR 0.53, IQR 0.31-0.88, p = 0.02). Data were confirmed at sensitivity 
      analysis for second-generation DES (759 pts, 63.9%). No differences were found in 
      this subpopulation between the two groups in term of AS, PC, and long-term MACE 
      (93.6% vs 93.5%, p = 0.28, 11.9% vs 9.4%, p = 0.32 and 25.5% vs 23.9%, p = 0.72, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Treating coronary lesions ≥ 25 mm length with RA does 
      not impact short- and long-term outcome, in particular, in patients with 
      second-generation DES. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Serum uric acid levels predict the development of albuminuria over 6 years in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes: findings from the Coronary Artery Calcification in 
      Type 1 Diabetes study.
PG  - 1865-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that uric acid is a mediator of diabetic 
      nephropathy. We hypothesized that elevated serum uric acid levels are a strong 
      predictor of albuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We analyzed data 
      from the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study, a prospective 
      observational study. A stepwise logistic regression model was applied to predict the 
      development of micro- or macroalbuminuria after 6 years of follow-up in 324 
      participants who had no evidence of micro- or macroalbuminuria at baseline. A 
      P-value <0.1 was used as the criteria for entry into and removal from the model. 
      RESULTS: The following factors were selected in the stepwise multivariate model as 
      predictors of micro- or macroalbuminuria at the 6-year follow-up visit: baseline 
      serum uric acid levels, HbA(1c) and pre-albuminuria. For every 1-mg/dl increase in 
      serum uric acid levels at baseline, there was an 80% increased risk of developing 
      micro- or macroalbuminuria at 6 years (odds ratio 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 
      2.8; P = 0.005). Additional covariates considered in the stepwise model were sex, 
      age, duration of diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II 
      receptor blocker treatment, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, body mass index, 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking, serum creatinine, cystatin C, 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: Elevated serum 
      uric acid levels are a strong predictor of the development of albuminuria in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla-Protein Is Associated With Arterial Stiffness in an Adult 
      Population-Based Study.
PG  - 85-92
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05177 [doi]
AB  - Increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a marker of aortic stiffness and an 
      independent predictor of mortality. Matrix Gla-protein (MGP) is a vascular 
      calcification inhibitor that needs vitamin K to be activated. Inactive MGP, known as 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), can be measured in plasma and has been 
      associated with various cardiovascular markers, cardiovascular outcomes, and 
      mortality. In this study, we hypothesized that high levels of dp-ucMGP are 
      associated with increased PWV. We recruited participants via a multicenter 
      family-based cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Dp-ucMGP was quantified in plasma 
      by sandwich ELISA. Aortic PWV was determined by applanation tonometry using carotid 
      and femoral pulse waveforms. Multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate 
      associations between PWV and dp-ucMGP adjusting for age, renal function, and other 
      cardiovascular risk factors. We included 1001 participants in our analyses (475 men 
      and 526 women). Mean values were 7.87±2.10 m/s for PWV and 0.43±0.20 nmol/L for 
      dp-ucMGP. PWV was positively associated with dp-ucMGP both before and after 
      adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, height, systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressure (BP), heart rate, renal function, low- and high-density lipoprotein, 
      glucose, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, BP and cholesterol lowering drugs, and 
      history of cardiovascular disease (P≤0.01). In conclusion, high levels of dp-ucMGP 
      are independently and positively associated with arterial stiffness after adjustment 
      for common cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and age. Experimental 
      studies are needed to determine whether vitamin K supplementation slows arterial 
      stiffening by increasing MGP carboxylation.

TI  - Increased arterial inflammation in individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 333-339
LID - 10.1007/s00259-015-3203-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are 
      at increased risk for the development and progression of atherosclerosis, it is not 
      known whether arterial inflammation is increased in mild CKD. The aim of this study 
      was to compare arterial inflammation using (18)F-FDG PET/CT in patients with CKD and 
      in matched controls. METHODS: This restrospective study included 128 patients 
      undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with 
      stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer history. CKD 
      was defined according to guidelines using a calculated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on 
      PET. Background FDG uptake (venous, subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. 
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact of 
      CKD on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed. RESULTS: Arterial 
      inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in matched controls (standardized 
      uptake value, SUV: 2.41 ± 0.49 vs. 2.16 ± 0.43; p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated 
      inversely with eGFR (r = -0.299, p = 0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly 
      elevated in patients with CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not 
      differ between groups. Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in 
      patients with CKD compared to controls after correcting for muscle and fat 
      background, and also remained significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. 
      Further, CKD was associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the 
      presence of subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC). CONCLUSION: Moderate CKD is 
      associated with increased arterial inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, 
      the increased arterial inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical 
      atherosclerosis. Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of 
      atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular events.

TI  - User of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor 
      blocker might be associated with vascular calcification in predialysis chronic 
      kidney disease patients: a retrospective single-center observational study : 
      ACEI/ARB and vascular calcification.
PG  - 7

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a prominent feature in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and diabetes mellitus. A recent report suggests that angiotensin II is 
      protective to vascular calcification. Therefore, we investigated the relationship 
      between vascular calcification and use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor 
      (ACEI) and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) from a cross-sectional view. 
      METHODS: A total of 121 predialysis CKD patients (age 71 ± 12 y; male 72; estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20.2 (11.8 - 40.3) mL/min/1.73 m(2)) who underwent 
      thoracoabdominal plain computed tomography scan were included in this study. The 
      total vascular calcification volume (Calc) was calculated with a three-dimensional 
      imaging software and standardized by body surface area (BSA). The relevance between 
      log [Calc/BSA] and ACEI/ARB use was investigated by multivariate linear regression 
      analyses with or without a time-duration factor of ACEI/ARB use. RESULTS: The 
      Calc/BSA was 5.62 (2.01 - 12.7) mL/m(2) in 121 patients. In multivariate analyses 
      adjusted with age, sex, ACEI/ARB and log [eGFR], ACEI/ARB use is significantly and 
      positively associated with log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.2781, p = 0.0007). Even after the 
      adjustment by age, sex, log [eGFR], phosphate, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood 
      pressure, warfarin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
      diuretics and ACEI/ARB, ACEI/ARB use is significantly and positively associated with 
      log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.1677, p = 0.0487). When 90 patients whose time-duration of 
      ACEI/ARB use was clear in medical records were studied, a multivariate analysis 
      adjusted with age, sex, log [eGFR], and ACEI/ARB duration factors showed that the 
      longer use of ACEI/ARB more than 2 years was significantly, independently and 
      positively associated with log [Calc/BSA] (β = 0.2864, p = 0.0060). CONCLUSIONS: 
      ACEI/ARB user was associated with vascular calcification in predialysis patients 
      with low eGFR. Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients or more in vitro 
      studies are needed to confirm whether this phenomenon is due to the use of ACEI/ARB 
      itself, the underlying disease condition or the prescription bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High IS level has been demonstrated to be associated with vascular 
      calcification and lymphocyte functional disorders, which are both risk factors of 
      CVD. Low HDL-c level is a risk factor of CVD in CKD patients. This study was 
      designed to explore the potential relationship between IS and HDL-c levels in early 
      stages of CKD population. METHODS: Patients of CKD stage 1-3 were enrolled in this 
      cross-sectional study. Correlations between HDL-c and IS levels were investigated 
      among various clinicopathological variables through independent samples t test and 
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 205 CKD patients (96 men) aged 
      43.27 ± 13.80 years old were included in this research. There were 96 patients (46 
      men) in CKD stage1 and 109 (50 men) in CKD stage 2 or stage 3. IS levels were 
      significantly higher in CKD 2 + 3 group (1.50 ± 1.74 μg/ml vs. 0.94 ± 0.66 μg/ml, 
      p = 0.007), while HDL-c levels were lower (1.19 ± 0.39 mmol/L vs. 
      1.33 ± 0.45 mmol/L, p = 0.017) compared to CKD 1 group. Among all the patients, a 
      negative correlation was observed between IS and HDL-c levels (r = -0.244, 
      p = 0.001). IS level was an independent risk factor for low HDL-c (<1.04 mmol/L) 
      incidence even after controlling for potential confounders including concomitant 
      disease, age, sex, blood pressure, BMI and laboratory biochemical test including 
      eGFR (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.11-2.39, p = 0.013). IS and HDL-c were both risk factors 
      for predicting CKD stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: In early CKD stages, low HDL-c level is 
      associated with increased IS levels, which may be an important contributor in the 
      development of dyslipidemia in CKD patients.

AB  - Bisphosphonates appear to regulate mineralization in both bone and vasculature. 
      Degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) is thought to be due to vascular calcification. We 
      studied the effect of bisphosphonates on the progression of degenerative AS. A 
      retrospective study was performed on patients >70 years, who had transthoracic 
      echocardiograms (TTE) >1 year apart and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of 
      0.6-2.0 cm². Patients were excluded if they had an ejection fraction <40%, other 
      significant valvular or congenital heart disease, end-stage renal disease or heart 
      transplant. The cohort was divided depending on the use of bisphosphonates. Data 
      were obtained by review of the TTE reports. AVA, peak and mean aortic valve gradient 
      (AVG), and the change between the studies were calculated. Of 4,270 patients 
      screened for AS, 76 patients fit study criteria with 8 in the bisphosphonate group 
      and 68 in the nonbisphosphonate group. The period between the TTEs was 23 ± 5 months 
      in both the groups. AVA in the nonbisphosphonate group worsened by 0.2 cm² and in 
      the bisphosphonate group it improved by 0.1 cm² (P = 0.001 vs. nonbisphosphonate). 
      The changes in peak and mean AVG between groups and compared to baseline were not 
      significant. Bisphosphonates show promise for slowing the progression of 
      degenerative AS.

TI  - The risk of nephrolithiasis is causally related to inactive matrix Gla protein, a 
      marker of vitamin K status: a Mendelian randomization study in a Flemish population.
PG  - 514-522
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K (VK)-dependent γ-glutamate carboxylation and serine 
      phosphorylation activate matrix Gla protein (MGP) to a potent locally acting 
      inhibitor of calcification. Nephrolithiasis represents a process of unwanted 
      calcification associated with substantial mortality and high recurrence rates. We 
      hypothesized that the risk of nephrolithiasis increases with VK shortage, as 
      exemplified by higher plasma levels of desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). 
      METHODS: In 1748 randomly recruited Flemish individuals (51.1% women; mean age 46.8 
      years), we determined dp-ucMGP and the prevalence of nephrolithiasis at baseline 
      (April 1996-February 2015) and its incidence during follow-up until March 2016. We 
      estimated the multivariable-adjusted relative risk associated with the doubling of 
      dp-ucMGP, using logistic or Cox regression. We did a Mendelian randomization 
      analysis using four MGP genotypes as instrumental variables. RESULTS: With 
      adjustments applied for sex, age and 24-h urinary volume and calcium excretion, the 
      odds of having prevalent nephrolithiasis [n = 144 (8.2%)] associated with dp-ucMGP 
      was 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.64; P = 0.022]. dp-ucMGP levels were 
      associated (P ≤ 0.001) with MGP variants rs2098435, rs4236 and rs2430692. In the 
      Mendelian analysis, the causal odds ratio was 3.82 (95% CI 1.15-12.7; P = 0.029). 
      The incidence of nephrolithiasis over 12.0 years (median) was 37 cases (0.2%). With 
      similar adjustments as before, the hazard ratio in relation to dp-ucMGP was 2.48 
      (95% CI 1.71-3.61; P < 0.001). Additional adjustment for a nephrolithiasis 
      propensity score produced consistent results. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of inactive 
      dp-ucMGP may be causally associated with the risk of nephrolithiasis. Whether or not 
      VK deficiency plays a role in these observations remains to be firmly established.

TI  - Association of kidney function and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein: data from the 
      Heart and Soul Study.
PG  - 2095-101
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in persons with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Matrix Gla 
      protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, and lower levels of 
      its precursor-uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP)--are associated with vascular calcification 
      and atherosclerosis. Whether mild to moderate decrements in kidney function are 
      associated with lower serum ucMGP is unknown. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 
      among 842 outpatients with stable CVD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
      serum cystatin-C and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured and serum 
      ucMGP levels were determined by ELISA. Multivariate linear regression evaluated the 
      association of each kidney function measure with serum ucMGP levels. RESULTS: The 
      mean eGFR was 76 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 186 subjects (22%) had moderate CKD 
      (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The mean +/- SD ucMGP level was 3289 +/- 1177 nM. In 
      unadjusted analysis, each 10 mL/ min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 101 nM 
      lower ucMGP level. This association was only minimally attenuated in final 
      multivariate models wherein each 10 mL/ min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 
      79 nM lower ucMGP (95% confidence interval [CI]; 44 to 115; P < 0.001) after 
      adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, 
      hypertension, diabetes; and serum albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and fetuin-A levels. 
      Similarly, in models adjusted for identical covariates, each 0.1 mg/L higher 
      cystatin-C was associated with 39 nM lower ucMGP (95% CI 23 to 55; P < 0.001). In 
      contrast, no significant association was observed between ACR and ucMGP in either 
      unadjusted or adjusted analyses (adjusted P = 0.17). All associations were similar 
      among subjects with or without diabetes (P-values for interaction > 0.50). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with stable CVD, a reduced glomerular filtration rate 
      is associated with a decreased serum ucMGP level. In contrast, ACR is not associated 
      with ucMGP levels. Whether ucMGP is a useful marker of vascular calcification and 
      CVD event risk in persons with CKD deserves future study.

TI  - Intermittent doses of statin in hemodialysis patients with spontaneous low LDL 
      cholesterol levels.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality in dialysis patients remains high and is due mainly to 
      cardiovascular causes. Inflammation has a role in the genesis of accelerated 
      atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, malnutrition and anemia, and a huge impact 
      on the survival of these patients. The pleiotropic effects of statins can be a 
      therapeutic option for reducing chronic inflammatory processes of patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of low doses of 
      simvastatin on inflammatory markers, hematimetric and nutritional parameters of 
      patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: Clinically-stable patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis were classified according to their baseline LDL-cholesterol levels in 
      two groups: those with levels below 100mg/dl (Group 1) and those with levels equal 
      to or greater than 100mg/dl (Group-2), and were treated with simvastatin during 
      eight weeks. Group 1 received 20mg only after each session of hemodialysis 
      (intermittent dose), whereas Group 2 received 20mg/daily. Laboratory data, 
      erythropoietin resistance index and nutritional parameters were obtained before and 
      after treatment. RESULTS: A significant and equivalent reduction in C-reactive 
      protein levels in both groups was observed (35.97+/-49.23% vs 38.32+/-32.69%, 
      p=0.86). In group 1, there was also a tendency towards reduced resistance to 
      erythropoietin (228.6+/-16.2 vs 208.9+/-16.2, p=0.058) and improvement of 
      hematimetric parameters (hematocrit: 33.1+/-5.9% vs 36.1+/-4.5%, p=0.021). 
      CONCLUSION: Intermittent doses proved to be as effective as the usual dose in 
      reducing C-reactive protein levels and resistance to erythropoietin, besides 
      improving the hematimetric parameters, indicating an important reduction of the 
      cardiovascular risk evaluated by these parameters.

TI  - Long-term outcomes in patients with calciphylaxis from hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare condition associated with chronic renal failure 
      and entails a very poor prognosis. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but involves 
      abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus metabolism that lead to vascular and 
      extravascular calcification. Patients present with painful ulcerating plaques that 
      progress to gangrenous wounds. Parathyroidectomy has been advanced as a life-saving 
      intervention in these patients, but long-term results with wound healing and 
      survival after parathyroidectomy are not well described. METHODS: Between January 
      1987 and October 2003, 15 patients with biopsy-confirmed calciphylaxis were treated 
      at the University of Wisconsin. Of these 15 patients, 9 were treated with medical 
      therapy (bisphosphonates and phosphate binders), whereas 6 underwent 
      parathyroidectomy. The medical records were reviewed, and patients or relatives were 
      interviewed. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Four 
      patients underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy, and two patients underwent total 
      parathyroidectomy. All had reductions in the intact parathyroid hormone level (mean 
      +/- SD, 25.2 +/- 4.5 pg/mL). Whereas all six patients treated with parathyroidectomy 
      had partial/complete wound healing, only two of nine in the medical group had any 
      improvements in the skin lesions (P = .006). With up to 80 months of follow-up, 
      patients who underwent parathyroidectomy had a longer median survival compared with 
      those who did not have surgery (39 vs. 3 months; P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: On the 
      basis of our long-term follow-up of this patient population, subtotal or total 
      parathyroidectomy was associated with long-term survival and was more likely to 
      promote healing if performed earlier in the course of disease. Therefore, patients 
      with calciphylaxis from secondary hyperparathyroidism should be referred promptly 
      for potential parathyroidectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous proteomics efforts in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) have predominantly evaluated urinary protein levels. Therefore, our 
      aim was to investigate the association between plasma levels of 80 cardiovascular 
      disease-related proteins and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
      in patients with CKD. METHODS: Individuals with CKD stages 3-5 (eGFR below 60 ml 
      min-1 [1.73 m]-2) from three community-based cohorts (PIVUS, ULSAM, SAVA), one 
      diabetes cohort (CARDIPP) and one cohort with peripheral artery disease patients 
      (PADVA) with information on 80 plasma protein biomarkers, assessed with a proximity 
      extension assay, and follow-up data on incident MACE, were used as discovery sample. 
      To validate findings and to asses generalizability to patients with CKD in clinical 
      practice, an outpatient CKD-cohort (Malnutrition, Inflammation and Vascular 
      Calcification (MIVC)) was used as replication sample. RESULTS: In the discovery 
      sample (total n = 1316), 249 individuals experienced MACE during 7.0 ± 2.9 years 
      (range 0.005-12.9) of follow-up, and in the replication sample, 71 MACE events in 
      283 individuals over a mean ± SD change of 2.9 ± 1.2 years (range 0.1-4.0) were 
      documented. Applying Bonferroni correction, 18 proteins were significantly 
      associated with risk of MACE in the discovery cohort, adjusting for age and sex in 
      order of significance, GDF-15, FGF-23, REN, FABP4, IL6, TNF-R1, AGRP, MMP-12, AM, 
      KIM-1, TRAILR2, TNFR2, CTSL1, CSF1, PlGF, CA-125, CCL20 and PAR-1 (p < 0.000625 for 
      all). Only matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP-12) was significantly associated with an 
      increased risk of MACE in the replication sample (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 
      1.36, 95% CI (1.07-1.75), p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomics analyses 
      identified plasma MMP-12 as a promising cardiovascular risk marker in patients with 
      CKD.

LID - 10.1159/000509582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 4-5) have an 
      increased risk of death. To study the determinants of all-cause mortality, we 
      recruited 210 consecutive CKD stage 4-5 patients not on dialysis to the prospective 
      Chronic Arterial Disease, quality of life and mortality in chronic KIDney injury 
      (CADKID) study. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four patients underwent maximal bicycle 
      ergometry stress testing and lateral lumbar radiography to study abdominal aortic 
      calcification score and echocardiography. Carotid and femoral artery intima-media 
      thickness and elasticity and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation were measured 
      in 156 patients. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up was 42 ± 17 months (range 
      134-2,217 days). The mean age was 61 ± 14 years, and the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate was 12 (11-15) mL/min/1.73 m2. Thirty-six (21%) patients died during 
      follow-up (time to death 835 ± 372 days). Seventy-five and 21 patients had diabetes 
      and coronary artery disease, respectively, and all but one had hypertension. In the 
      respective multivariate proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and 
      coronary artery disease, the significant determinants of mortality were troponin T, 
      N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, maximal ergometry performance, abdominal 
      aortic calcification score, E/e' ratio, and albumin. CONCLUSION: Stress ergometry 
      performance, abdominal aortic calcification score, E/e' of echocardiography, and 
      plasma cardiac biomarkers and albumin predict mortality in advanced CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification represents a marker of cardiovascular risk 
      in chronic dialysis patients. In the general population, aortic arch calcification 
      (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a prospective study to 
      investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis patients and examined its 
      prognostic value in long-term outcome. METHODS: A total of 712 hemodialysis patients 
      were enrolled. AAC was identified on postero-anterior chest X-ray films and 
      classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Demographic data including age, gender, 
      dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The 
      patients were followed for 10 years. RESULTS: AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) 
      as Gr. 1, in 116 patients (16.3%) as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An 
      increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older patients who had 
      lower albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10 
      years, we found that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular 
      mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p < 0.05) and 
      all-cause mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3: 53.2%; p < 
      0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
      calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients 
      with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The severity of 
      AAC also influenced their survival. CONCLUSION: Calcification of the aortic arch 
      detected in plain chest radiography was an important determinant of cardiovascular 
      as well as all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients. The presence and 
      severity of AAC predicted long-term survival.

TI  - Impact of abdominal aortic calcification on 90-day mortality in sepsis patients: a 
      pilot retrospective cohort study.
PG  - e630

LID - e630
AB  - AIM: We aimed to investigate the association between aortic calcification and 90-day 
      mortality in sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit. METHODS: We 
      evaluated adult patients (≥18 years) diagnosed with sepsis based on the Sepsis-3 
      criteria and admitted to our intensive care unit between April 2011 and March 2015. 
      They were classified according to the degree of abdominal aortic calcification 
      (severe and non-severe), grouped per age (<65, 65-75, and >75 years), and matched. 
      Survival curves were generated, and between-group differences were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 164 patients were included. The Acute Physiology and Chronic 
      Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were not 
      significantly different between the severity groups, whereas there were significant 
      differences in age (P < 0.001), sex (P = 0.017), and presence of diabetes mellitus 
      (P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), dyslipidemia (P = 0.048), and maintenance 
      dialysis (P = 0.001). The severe abdominal aortic calcification group showed 
      significantly poorer prognosis than the non-severe group (log-rank P = 0.009). The 
      adjusted odds ratio of severe calcification was the highest in patients aged 
      <65 years (7.167; 95% confidence interval, 1.042-49.28, P = 0.045). Twenty-eight 
      patients from each group were matched. The 90-day survival rate of the severe 
      calcification group remained significantly lower than that of the non-severe 
      calcification group (53.6% [15/28] versus 82.1% [23/28], P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Severe abdominal aortic calcification is associated with the 90-day mortality of 
      sepsis patients, particularly among those aged <65 years. Thus, caution is necessary 
      in patients younger than 65 years; they may need to be treated with as much care as 
      the elderly.

TI  - Hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Kidney Disease.
BTI - Endotext
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) isassociatedwith amineraland 
      bonedisorder(CKD-MBD)whichstarts early in the course of the disease and worsens with 
      its progression. The main initial serum biochemistry abnormalities are increases in 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreases in 
      1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) and soluble a-Klotho (Klotho), allowing serum 
      calcium and phosphate to stay normal. However, in later CKD stages hyperphosphatemia 
      develops in the majority of patients, and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (calcidiol) 
      decreases. Serum calcium may stay normal, decrease, or increase. More recent studies 
      suggest that circulating Wnt-b-catenin pathway inhibitors such as sclerostin and 
      Dickkopf-1 also play an important role in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD.Both the 
      synthesis and the secretion of PTH are continuously stimulated, resulting in 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism.In addition to the complex effects of the above 
      systemic disturbances parathyroid tissue downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 
      calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), and Klotho – a local co-receptor of cognate 
      fibroblast growth factor receptors of FGF23 – further aggravates the impaired 
      control of PTH synthesis and secretion. More recently, miRNAs have been shown to 
      also contribute to the stimulation of the parathyroid in the uremic state. The 
      chronic stimulation of parathyroid secretory function is not only characterized by a 
      progressive rise in serum PTH but also by parathyroid gland hyperplasia. It results 
      from an increase in parathyroid cell proliferation which is not fully compensated by 
      a concomitant increase in parathyroid cell apoptosis. Parathyroid hyperplasia is 
      initially of the diffuse, polyclonal type. In late CKD stages it often evolves 
      towards a nodular, monoclonal or multiclonal type of growth. Enhanced parathyroid 
      expression of transforming growth factor-a and its receptor, the epidermal growth 
      factor receptor, is involvedin polyclonal hyperplasia.Chromosomal changes have been 
      found to be associated with clonal outgrowth in some, but notthe majority of benign 
      parathyroid tumors removed from patients with end-stage renal disease.In initial CKD 
      stagesskeletal resistance to the action of PTH may explain why low bone turnover 
      predominates in a significant proportion of patients, together with other conditions 
      inhibiting bone turnover such as reduced calcitriol levels, sex hormone deficiency, 
      diabetes, and uremic toxins, leading to repression of osteocyte Wnt-b-catenin 
      pathway signaling and increased expression of Wntantagonists such as sclerostin and 
      Dickkopf-1. High turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa) occurs only later on, when 
      serum PTH levels are able to overcome skeletal PTH resistance. The diagnosis of 
      secondary uremic hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa relies at present mainly 
      on serum biochemistry. X-ray examination of the skeleton is useful only in severe 
      forms. It also allows assessment of concomitant vascular calcification. From a 
      therapeutic point of view, it is important to prevent the development of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism as early as possible in the course of CKD. A variety of 
      prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are available, as outlined in the final part 
      of the chapter. For complete coverage of all related areas of Endocrinology, please

TI  - Reduced serum fetuin-A in nephrotic children: a consequence of proteinuria?
PG  - 373-80
LID - 10.1159/000331061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extracellular protein fetuin-A is a potent soluble inhibitor of 
      calcification, and its deficiency has been associated with vascular calcification in 
      dialysis patients. In proteinuric patients, significant urinary losses of fetuin-A 
      may cause low serum fetuin-A levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 
      urinary/serum concentrations of fetuin-A were investigated in proteinuric children 
      with glomerular diseases and preserved renal function (n = 58) in comparison to 
      healthy controls (n = 246). RESULTS: Mean fetuin-A serum concentrations were clearly 
      reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome (0.25 ± 0.14 g/l, p < 0.001), slightly 
      reduced in children with large proteinuria (0.39 ± 0.15 g/l, p < 0.05), and 
      comparable to controls in those with mild proteinuria (0.45 ± 0.14 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12 
      g/l). Fetuin-A was positively correlated with serum protein (r = 0.58), albumin (r = 
      0.57), and calcium (r = 0.64), but negatively correlated with proteinuria (r = 
      -0.41), albuminuria (r = -0.46), and urinary fetuin-A excretion (r = -0.48; each p < 
      0.001). The fractional excretion of fetuin-A was significantly associated with the 
      degree of proteinuria and serum fetuin-A levels. However, the urinary loss of 
      fetuin-A and albumin in nephrotic children differed by three orders of magnitude and 
      the mean fractional excretion of fetuin-A was only 1/10 of that of albumin (0.016 ± 
      0.029 vs. 0.162 ± 0.403%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin-A is clearly reduced in 
      children with nephrotic syndrome and associated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia. 
      This is due to urinary fetuin-A loss and/or reduced hepatic synthesis. Persistent 
      fetuin-A deficiency may have an impact on cardiovascular morbidity in nephrotic 
      children.

TI  - Serum fetuin-A levels increased following parathyroidectomy in uremic 
      hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 89-96
LID - 10.10.5414/CN106757 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both fetuin-A and hyperparathyroidism play crucial roles in vascular 
      calcification (VC) and bone metabolism. However, the correlation between secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), parathyroidectomy (PTX) and fetuin-A levels in dialysis 
      patients has not yet been studied. METHODS: For this study, we included 27 
      consecutive dialysis patients with severe SHPT who underwent total PTX with 
      autotransplantation over a period of 2 years (from Oct 2006 to Sep 2008). Serum 
      ionized calcium (iCa), phosphorus (Pi), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP), 
      intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and fetuin-A were checked basally and 2, 7, 14, 
      30, and 60 days after PTX. RESULTS: Two days after PTX, the iPTH, serum iCa, and Pi 
      concentrations significantly decreased. Serum bAP levels gradually increased after 
      PTX, peaked after 14 days (p < 0.05), and then gradually decreased. Serum fetuin-A 
      levels significantly increased during the first 7 days after PTX, peaked 14 days 
      after PTX (0.21 ± 0.05 vs. 0.35 ± 0.07 mg/ml, p < 0.05), and then remained at a 
      stable level 60 days after PTX. There were significant correlations between 
      percentage increase in serum fetuin-A levels and percentage decrease in serum iPTH 
      levels 2 days and 7 days after PTX (r = 0.526, p < 0.01; r = 0.403, p < 0.05, 
      respectively) and correlations between percentage increase in serum fetuin-A levels 
      and percentage decrease in serum iCa levels 30 and 60 days after PTX (r = 0.449, p < 
      0.05; r = 0.474, p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Serum fetuin-A significantly 
      increased after PTX in uremic patients with SHPT. The percentage increase in serum 
      fetuin-A after PTX was closely correlated with the percentage decrease in serum iPTH 
      levels immediately after PTX, and with the percentage decrease in serum iCa levels 
      in the later stage after PTX. Further investigations are necessary to further 
      understand the regulation of fetuin-A in dialysis patients with sSHPT.

TI  - Prognostic importance of the transmitral pressure gradient in mitral annular 
      calcification with associated mitral valve dysfunction.
PG  - 4321-4328
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa819 [doi]
AB  - AIMS : The aim of this study was to define the natural history of patients with 
      mitral annular calcification (MAC)-related mitral valve dysfunction and to assess 
      the prognostic importance of mean transmitral pressure gradient (MG) and impact of 
      concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS AND RESULTS : The institutional 
      echocardiography database was examined from 2001 to 2019 for all patients with MAC 
      and MG ≥3 mmHg. A total of 5754 patients were stratified by MG in low (3-5 mmHg, 
      n = 3927), mid (5-10 mmHg, n = 1476), and high (≥10 mmHg, n = 351) gradient. The 
      mean age was 78 ± 11 years, and 67% were female. MR was none/trace in 32%, mild in 
      42%, moderate in 23%, and severe in 3%. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and 
      outcome models were adjusted for age, sex, and MAC-related risk factors 
      (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease). Survival 
      at 1, 5, and 10 years was 77%, 42%, and 18% in the low-gradient group; 73%, 38%, and 
      17% in the mid-gradient group; and 67%, 25%, and 11% in the high-gradient group, 
      respectively (log-rank P < 0.001 between groups). MG was independently associated 
      with mortality (adjusted HR 1.064 per 1 mmHg increase, 95% CI 1.049-1.080). MR 
      severity was associated with mortality at low gradients (P < 0.001) but not at 
      higher gradients (P = 0.166 and 0.372 in the mid- and high-gradient groups, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION : In MAC-related mitral valve dysfunction, mean 
      transmitral gradient is associated with increased mortality after adjustment for 
      age, sex, and MAC-related risk factors. Concomitant MR is associated with excess 
      mortality in low-gradient ranges (3-5 mmHg) but gradually loses prognostic 
      importance at higher gradients, indicating prognostic utility of transmitral 
      gradient in MAC regardless of MR severity.

TI  - The use of intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonography in monitoring patients over 75 
      years old treated with aortic valve replacement.
PG  - 10-15
LID - 10.5114/kitp.2017.66923 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epiaortic ultrasound scanning (EAS) extended the use of ultrasound to 
      the intraoperative diagnosis of aortic pathology. Surgical palpation of the 
      ascending aorta underestimates the presence and severity of atherosclerotic plaques. 
      Epiaortic ultrasound scanning has been used as an adjunct to transesophageal 
      echocardiography (TEE) or as a primary direct diagnostic tool for imaging the 
      ascending aorta as well as the aortic arch, which gained prominence as part of a 
      multipronged intraoperative strategy to reduce atherosclerotic emboli. AIM: To 
      compare the epiaortic examination with transthoracic and transesophageal echo 
      (transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and TEE), X-ray, surgical intraoperative 
      palpation, and postoperative neurological status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analyzed 
      group consisted of 35 patients (mean age: 81.3 years) treated with aortic valve 
      replacement (AVR), either alone (60%) or combined with coronary artery bypass 
      grafting (CABG; 22.8%) or aortic aneurysm replacement (11.42%). In 2 patients, only 
      CABG was performed because intraoperatively reevaluated strategy. Thierteen patients 
      have got a history of diabetes, 10 chronic renal failure and 3 of cerebral stroke. 
      RESULTS: In more than 80% of patients, positive EAS results had an influence on the 
      choice of aortic clamping site and in 50% of patients on the site of cannulation. 
      Female sex, peripheral vascular disease, history of previous stroke, and 
      calcifications in the ascending aorta in TTE have significant predictive value for 
      recognizing atherosclerotic changes in EAS and the risk of postoperative 
      neurological complications in octogenarians treated with AVR. CONCLUSIONS: Epiaortic 
      ultrasound scanning imaging is superior to TTE and manual palpation in the detection 
      and localization of ascending atherosclerosis. This technique should be introduced 
      as a standard perioperative examination in older patients at risk of neurological 
      complications.

TI  - Secreted Phosphoprotein 24 is a Biomarker of Mineral Metabolism.
PG  - 354-363
LID - 10.1007/s00223-020-00783-3 [doi]
AB  - The 24 kD form of secreted phosphoprotein (SPP-24), a cytokine-binding bone matrix 
      protein with various truncated C-terminal products, is primarily synthesized by the 
      liver. SPP-24 shares homology with fetuin-A, a potent vascular and soft tissue 
      calcification inhibitor and SPP-24 is one component of calciprotein particles 
      (CPPs), a circulating fetuin-mineral complex. The limited molecular evidence to date 
      suggests that SPP-24 may also function as an inhibitor of bone formation and ectopic 
      vascular calcification, potentially through bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and 
      Wnt-signaling mediated actions. The C-terminal products of SPP-24 bind to BMP-2 and 
      attenuate BMP-2-induced bone formation. The aim of this study was to assess 
      circulating SPP-24 in relation to kidney function and in concert with markers of 
      mineral metabolism in humans. SPP-24 was measured in the serum of total of 192 
      subjects using ELISA-based measurements. Subjects were participants of one of two 
      cohorts: (1) mGFR Cohort (n = 80) was participants of a study of measured GFR (mGFR) 
      using inulin urinary clearance, recruited mostly from a chronic kidney disease 
      clinic with low-range kidney function (eGFR 38.7 ± 25.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and (2) 
      CaMOS Cohort (n = 112) was a subset of randomly selected, community-dwelling 
      participants of year 10 of the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study with eGFR in 
      the normal range of 75.0 ± 15.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In the combined cohort, the mean 
      SPP-24 was 167.7 ± 101.1 ng/mL (range 33.4-633.6 ng/mL). The mean age was 
      66.5 ± 11.3, 57.1% female and mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) was 59.9 ± 27.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) 
      (range 8-122 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). There was a strong inverse correlation between 
      SPP-24 and eGFR (R = - 0.58, p < 0.001) that remained after adjustment for age. 
      Following adjustment for age, eGFR, and sex, SPP-24 was significantly associated 
      with phosphate (R = - 0.199), PTH (R = 0.298), and the Wnt-signaling inhibitor 
      Dickkopf-related protein 1 (R = - 0.156). The results of this study indicate that 
      SPP-24 is significantly altered by kidney function and is the first human data 
      linking levels of SPP-24 to other biomarkers involved in mineral metabolism. Whether 
      there is a role for circulating SPP-24 in bone formation and ectopic mineralization 
      requires further study.
