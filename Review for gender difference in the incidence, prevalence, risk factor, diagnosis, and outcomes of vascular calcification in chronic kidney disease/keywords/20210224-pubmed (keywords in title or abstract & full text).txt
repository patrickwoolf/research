BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness-typically assessed from non-invasive measurement 
of pulse wave velocity along a straight portion of the vascular tree between the 
right common carotid and femoral arteries-is a reliable predictor of 
cardiovascular risk in patients with essential hypertension.
METHODS: We reviewed how carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity increases with age 
and is significantly higher in hypertension (than in age- and gender-matched 
individuals without hypertension), particularly when hypertension is associated 
with diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: From the elastic aorta to the muscular peripheral arteries of young 
healthy individuals, there is a gradual but significant increase in stiffness, 
with a specific gradient. This moderates the transmission of pulsatile pressure 
towards the periphery, thus protecting the microcirculatory network. The 
heterogeneity of stiffness between the elastic and muscular arteries causes the 
gradient to disappear or be inversed with aging, particularly in long-standing 
hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: In hypertension therefore, pulsatile pressure transmission to the 
microcirculation is augmented, increasing the potential risk of damage to the 
brain, the heart, and the kidney. Furthermore, elevated pulse pressure 
exacerbates end-stage renal disease, particularly in older hypertensive 
individuals. With increasing age, the elastin content of vessel walls declines 
throughout the arterial network, and arterial stiffening increases further due 
to the presence of rigid wall material such as collagen, but also fibronectin, 
proteoglycans, and vascular calcification. Certain genes, mainly related to 
angiotensin and/or aldosterone, affect this aging process and contribute to the 
extent of arterial stiffness, which can independently affect both forward and 
reflected pressure waves.

BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification 
(CAC) and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do 
not improve survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular 
calcification is unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory 
biomarkers, statins and mortality in ESRD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; median age 
56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney transplant 
(LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal dialysis 
patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), 
use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated in 
35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human 
vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism.
RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate 
analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, 
male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and 
mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, 
use of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 
35 patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression 
of CAC. In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired 
by statins.
CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of 
inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular 
calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney 
and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing 
abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the 
Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) score, may identify transplant recipients at higher 
CV risk.
METHODS: Between the years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first 
transplant recipients were scored for AAC at time of transplant and then 
followed for CV events (coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular 
disease), graft-loss, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC (26% 
moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 
months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft 
loss. For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV 
events and mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These 
were similar after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis 
vintage, and diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For 
recipients with high versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV 
events were 5.90 (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) 
and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) 
in age and smoking history-adjusted analyses.
CONCLUSION: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with high AAC have 3-fold 
higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than recipients without 
AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted risk-lowering 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is an independent predictor of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) present in 30-70% of patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Copeptin is a sensitive surrogate marker of arginine vasopressin 
(AVP), which is involved in many pathophysiologic processes in CKD. The aim of 
the present study was to explore the association of copeptin with VC in CKD 
stage 5.
METHODS: Copeptin was investigated in conjunction with living donor kidney 
transplantation in 149 clinically stable CKD stage 5 patients (CKD5), including 
53 non-dialyzed (CKD5-ND) and 96 dialysis patients treated by peritoneal 
dialysis (PD) (n = 43) or hemodialysis (HD) (n = 53). We analyzed the 
association of copeptin with presence and extent of VC ascertained both 
histologically in biopsies from the inferior epigastric artery (n = 137) and by 
coronary artery calcification (CAC) score measured by computed tomography.
RESULTS: Patients with higher copeptin were older, had higher systolic blood 
pressure, higher prevalence of CVD and their preceding time on chronic dialysis 
was longer. In Spearman's rank correlations (Rho), copeptin concentrations were 
significantly associated with CAC score (Rho = 0.27; p = 0.003) and presence of 
medial VC (Rho = 0.21; p = 0.016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed that 1-SD higher age, male gender, diabetes and 1-SD higher copeptin were 
significantly associated with the presence of moderate-extensive VC.
CONCLUSIONS: High circulating levels of copeptin in CKD5 patients are 
independently associated with the degree of medial calcification ascertained by 
histology of arterial biopsies. Thus, plasma copeptin may serve as a marker of 
the uremic calcification process.

INTRODUCTION: Coronary tortuosity (CorT) is a common coronary angiographic 
finding. The aetiology, clinical implication and long-term prognosis are not 
well clarified. Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is one of the most common 
cardiac structural abnormalities on echocardiographic examination. MAC and CorT 
are associated with atherosclerotic risk factors such as advanced age, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, female gender and 
chronic kidney disease. There are few data on the co-existence of MAC and CorT 
in the literature. This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the 
association between CorT and MAC.
METHODS: The medical records of consecutive patients who underwent coronary 
angiography were retrospectively reviewed. The study group consisted of 2 736 
patients. Taking into consideration the inclusion criteria, 392 patients with 
MAC and 687 patients without MAC (control group) were included in the study. 
Biochemical, clinical and echocardiographic parameters and CorT were evaluated 
in all patients. CorT was defined as three fixed bends during both systole and 
diastole, with the angle of each bend 45° or more.
RESULTS: Patients with MAC had a higher prevalence of hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, female gender, MAC and advanced age. On univariate analysis, 
advanced age, hypertension, female gender, hyperlipidaemia and MAC were 
associated with CorT. On multivariate analysis MAC, advanced age and 
hypertension were independent predictors for CorT (OR 2.167, 95% CI: 
1.436-4.283, p < 0.001; OR 1.243, 95% CI: 1.243-3.674, p < 0.001; OR 2.358, 95% 
CI: 1.864-4.681, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found a significant relationship between MAC and 
CorT.

[Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone 
disorder].

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney 
disease in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone 
disorder (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic 
patients on hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher 
prevalence of severe and progressive vascular calcification with increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main factor which causes vascular 
calcification in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic 
control. The recent trial findings describe an inverse correlation between 
intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels and glycemic control in a group 
of diabetic patients on hemodialysis.
AIM: The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the 
laboratory markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on 
glycemic control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic 
compensation of diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 3rd stage DKD were investigated. 
There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), average age of patients was 
71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l and estimated glomerular 
filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 patients with better 
glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. Patients were 
further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH (iPTH < 35 
pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis was 
performed using and Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: We have found the statistical significance in the serum phosphate and 
proteinuria levels in between groups with HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 
%. Diabetics with better glycemic control had significant reduction in serum 
phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p = 0.038) and in 24 hrs 
proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 0.007). In the group of 
presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found the trend towards 
increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, p = 0.063) and 
increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control 
of diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in 
patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an 
important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was 
conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and 
serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated 
tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery 
stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles.
RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial 
stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), 
serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels 
were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
(p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis 
showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, 
p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for 
tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, 
DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum 
OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for 
trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD 
patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in 
the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and 
central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG 
levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial 
stiffening.

INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We 
wished to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with 
changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients.
METHODS: We measured vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and 
BMD by dual electron absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to 
compensate for differences in patient ages and gender.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had repeat aPWV measurements and DXA scans, median 
12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased in 15 and increased in 9. As there were more 
women in the group with an increase in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted DXA T 
scores Total body T scores fell in both groups, but median T scores remained 
positive for those with an increase in aPWV, whereas negative T scores on both 
scans for those with a decrease in or stable aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in 
those with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to 0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 
0.05), whereas there was no significant decrease in those with an increase in 
aPWV (-0.5 [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]). There were no changes in 
femoral neck T scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothesis of a link between bone disease 
and vascular disease in dialysis patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging of 
the aorta and will include aortic calcification, and as such a reduction in 
lumbar spine T score without a change in femoral neck T score suggests a 
reduction in aortic calcification. Although our study requires additional 
confirmation, our data would suggest that changes in aPWV could be used as a 
surrogate for changes in vascular calcification in the investigation of 
interventions designed to reduce vascular calcification.

AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral 
density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to 
atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of 
VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD.
METHODS: Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or 
simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients 
underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was 
scored using a validated 24-point scale.
RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their 
median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months 
(0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, 
with the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and 
presence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a 
multivariate analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older 
and of longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; 
P < 0.001 for both). In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with 
gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or 
calcium or calcitriol therapy, and was not inversely related to hip, spine or 
forearm BMD Z-scores.
CONCLUSION: VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, 
similar to older patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and 
cardiovascular pathology. However, in this younger patient group, there was no 
significant inverse association of VC to BMD.

CONTEXT: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal 
transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated 
Wnt signaling contributes to VC.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the 
Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC.
DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels 
Renal Transplant Cohort study.
SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital.
PATIENTS: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by 
multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 
61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 
4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood 
samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline 
VC and progression.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was progression of VC.
RESULTS: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of 
the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The 
cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between 
sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse 
after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin 
level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta 
calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin 
levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after 
adjustment for traditional risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and 
progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our 
data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease 
patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the 
vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory 
mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are 
required for confirmation.

Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events 
and hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We 
aimed to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can 
predict post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to 
assess its association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal 
function in one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective 
study enrolled 37 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of 
vascular events. Two radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as 
suggested by Ogawa et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The 
mismatching results were repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. 
Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was 
measured using applanation tonometry before and one year after transplantation. 
Patient clinical, biochemical data, and cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored 
within 1 year. We found out that eGFR1year correlated with eGFRdischarge and 
calcium based on hospital discharge data (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, 
p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear regression revealed that donor age, 
donor gender, and recipient eGFRdischarge (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better 
predict eGFR1year than AoAC combined with recipient eGFRdischarge (R-squared 
0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four (10.81%) patients experienced 
cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), 
but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In conclusion, KTR without 
previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE rate within 1-year 
follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray together with 
recipient eGFRdischarge could be related to kidney function in one-year 
follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) 
develop significant vascular calcification early in life, the cause of which is 
not yet fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney disease have similar 
vascular calcification, with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in 
these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between patients 
with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether there is a 
correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, 
and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with HoFH.
METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional review involving 30 patients with HoFH 
attending the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital Lipid Clinic in 
Parktown, South Africa, as well as 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. 
FGF23, fasting lipid profiles, calcium, and phosphate were measured. B-mode 
ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was done to assess the extent and 
severity of arterial calcification.
RESULTS: There was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient and control 
groups (62.07 ± 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 ± 19.84 pg/mL; P = .4621) nor was there any 
correlation between FGF23 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .9483 and 
.8474) or total cholesterol (P = .9261 and .859). In the HoFH patients, FGF23 
did not correlate significantly with any cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when compared to 
non-familial hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched controls, and there is 
no correlation between serum FGF23 and cardiovascular disease in patients with 
HoFH. FGF23 does not appear to be a major factor for arterial calcification in 
HoFH.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this 
population. The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic 
calcification volume (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) in a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.
METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this 
prospective observational study. At study entry, and annually, GFR was measured 
by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, haemodynamics was assessed and AACV 
was determined by computer tomography.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 
mL/min/1.73 m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was 
detected in 66 patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed 
that age was the only statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In 
patients with AAC, male gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood 
pressure (B = -0.025, p = 0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 
0.002) were independently associated with AACV using a multiple linear 
regression analysis. Neither the presence nor the extent of AAC was 
significantly associated with the rate of change in GFR during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, only age was an 
independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not associated with the 
rate of decline in GFR.

Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process 
similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects 
the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. 
Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including 
age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact 
cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. 
Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional 
imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, 
these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early 
calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue 
mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of 
cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive 
interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of 
calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which 
are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on 
the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular 
calcification.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder suggests that fragile 
bone and vascular disorder might be connected closely in CKD patients. In this 
study, fracture event was significantly associated with myocardial infarction 
(MI) in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (HD), especially for 
vertebral fractures.
INTRODUCTION: CKD-mineral and bone disorder is characterized by biochemical 
abnormalities, bone disorders, and vascular calcification. We aimed to verify 
the association between fracture and MI in CKD patients.
METHODS: Records for incident CKD stage 3 to 5 patients and patients who 
initiated HD between July 2014 and June 2018 were retrieved from the Korean 
Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service Database. Fractures were defined 
using diagnostic codes and were classified into vertebral, femoral, and other 
site fractures. MI was defined using a combination of MI diagnostic codes and 
related procedure codes. Multiple logistic regressions and 1:1 propensity score 
matching analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 38,935 patients (HD, 11,379; pre-dialysis CKD, 27,556) were 
included in this study. A total of 5,057 (13.0%) patients experienced fracture, 
and 1,431 (3.7%) patients had MI. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed 
that fracture was significantly associated with MI in the HD group (odds ratio 
(OR) 1.34, P = 0.024), but not in the pre-dialysis CKD group (OR 1.04, 
P = 0.701). After propensity score matching for age, gender, and diabetes 
mellitus between patients with and without fracture, fracture still 
significantly correlated with MI in HD patients (OR 1.47, P = 0.034) but not in 
patients with pre-dialysis CKD (OR 1.04, P = 0.751). Subgroup analysis by 
fracture site found that vertebral fracture was associated with MI in HD 
patients (OR 2.11, P = 0.024), but femoral or other site fractures were not.
CONCLUSION: In HD patients, fracture was significantly associated with MI, 
especially for vertebral fractures patients.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and 
analyzed the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers 
and AoAC.
METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X 
ray examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast 
growth factor-23 (FGF-23).
RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score 
≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum 
levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
AoAC.
CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum 
FGF-23 levels were independently associated with AoAC.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is 
associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest 
that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, 
metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been 
characterized. The present study investigated the association between metformin 
use and lower-limb arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and 
high cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with 
type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee 
calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by 
colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully 
collected from the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. 
Biochemical and clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification 
score than metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 
4684 ± 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that 
metformin was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of severe 
below-the-knee arterial calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly 
associated with the use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, 
insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic 
regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use and 
calcification score (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; 
p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use, renal function, previous 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA1c 
levels, and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently 
associated with a lower below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This 
association may contribute to metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. 
Further prospective investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit 
VC in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these 
results.

OBJECTIVE: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic calcification 
is more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of adverse cardiovascular 
outcome. The aim of the present study was to characterize aortic calcification 
in renal compared with non-renal patients.
METHODS: Aortas of 31 patients with advanced CKD and of 31 age-and 
gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. Calcium and phosphorus content 
in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis. The expression of 
calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting proteins was assessed using 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The calcium and phosphorus content of the aorta was higher in CKD 
patients than in controls. Even in non-calcified aortic specimens of CKD, 
staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine was 
significantly more marked compared to controls. The same proteins were 
immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens of both CKD and controls. In 
contrast, staining for transglutaminase-2 and Fetuin A was significantly reduced 
in CKD. Higher expression of cbfa-1 and Pit-1 was observed in all calcified 
aortas with no difference between CKD and controls. The expression of TNF-alpha, 
phospho-p38 and Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of upregulation of BMP-2 
and osteoblastic transdifferentiation by VSMC even in non-calcified areas of the 
aortas of CKD.
CONCLUSION: The expression of markers characteristic for calcification is not 
different in calcified aorta of CKD patients compared to controls, but in CKD 
patients, evidence of inflammation, transformation to an osteoblastic phenotype 
and reduced expression of transglutaminase are also found even in non-calcified 
aorta.

PURPOSE: While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
are at increased risk for the development and progression of atherosclerosis, it 
is not known whether arterial inflammation is increased in mild CKD. The aim of 
this study was to compare arterial inflammation using 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients 
with CKD and in matched controls.
METHODS: This restrospective study included 128 patients undergoing FDG PET/CT 
imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with stage 3 CKD and 64 
control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer history. CKD was defined 
according to guidelines using a calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 
Arterial inflammation was measured in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. 
Background FDG uptake (venous, subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. 
Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact 
of CKD on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed.
RESULTS: Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in matched 
controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 ± 0.49 vs. 2.16 ± 0.43; 
p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR (r = -0.299, p = 0.001). 
Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in patients with CKD, while 
subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not differ between groups. Moreover, 
arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in patients with CKD compared to 
controls after correcting for muscle and fat background, and also remained 
significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was 
associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of 
subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC).
CONCLUSION: Moderate CKD is associated with increased arterial inflammation 
beyond that of controls. Further, the increased arterial inflammation is 
independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Current risk 
stratification tools may underestimate the presence of atherosclerosis in 
patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular events.

Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown 
to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess 
characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study 
of 124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two 
HD-dependent patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery 
disease were compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for 
age, diabetes mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics 
were comparable. Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 
paired non-culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum 
lumen area, and area stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent 
group had greater mean calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and 
non-culprit lesions (34.3° vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc 
in distal vessel segments (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in 
lipid arcs between groups. There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal 
calcium, defined as an arc of calcium >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in 
patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher 
prevalence of calcified nodules in the HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 
0.049) but no differences in medial calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In 
conclusion, in this OCT study, HD-dependent patients, compared with matched 
patients without CKD, had more extensively distributed coronary calcium and 
uniquely, a higher prevalence of non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This 
thin intimal calcium may cause an overestimation of calcium burden by 
intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to the lack of correlation between 
increased coronary artery calcification scores with long-term outcomes in 
patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic renal disease (CKD) is a determinant of coronary artery 
calcification (CAC), which is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, in 
a population without CKD, the association between CAC and renal function is 
unclear. CAC is affected by sex. This study aimed to determine whether serum 
cystatin C, a sensitive marker of kidney function, or sex differences are 
associated with CAC in patients without CKD.
METHODS: We evaluated 456 consecutive patients (61±13 years, 42% women) without 
CKD and evidence of coronary artery disease. The CAC (Agatston) score was 
examined by multidetector computed tomography.
RESULTS: When patients were categorized into three CAC groups based on the 
Agatston score, mild (<10), moderate (11-399), and severe (≥400) in each sex, 
serum cystatin C levels gradually increased by severity of CAC in women, but not 
men. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that, in women, a 
cut-off value of 0.97mg/l for cystatin C discriminated patients with severe CAC 
with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 77% (area under the curve, 0.74; 
95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p<0.01). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that serum 
cystatin C was not associated with severe CAC in all patients and men, but this 
association was observed in women (OR: 7.80 for cystatin C≥0.97mg/l, 95% CI: 
1.76-34.6, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C levels are associated with greater CAC in 
women without CKD. Measurement of cystatin C may be useful for identifying women 
who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and 
distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium 
scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who 
underwent CT of the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 
75 men and 56 women with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a 
separate semiquantitative score for calcification length, circumferential 
involvement, and morphology for the common iliac arteries and for the external 
iliac arteries. The operative and clinical notes were reviewed to determine 
which iliac arterial segment was used for anastomosis, the complexity of the 
operation, and whether delayed graft function (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft 
survival and patient survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.
RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for each calcification 
score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly higher average 
calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all categories. 
Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of higher 
scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, 
hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the 
calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was 
independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. 
None of the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, 
patients with CT evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year 
survival after transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used 
for anastomosis was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. 
Routine pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age 
or those with diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for 
anastomosis to optimize outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of 
secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to 
reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess 
effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis 
patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles 
(CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation 
associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
disease.
METHODS: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between 
August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study. 
Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 
12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an age- and 
gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve dialysis patients.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age was 
69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of 
cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 
27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium 
(2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) 
(p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), 
calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin 
(p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five 
cardiovascular events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, 
with a mortality rate of 19% (n = 13).
CONCLUSION: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real 
world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and CPP subsets, 
novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

PURPOSE: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular 
calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel 
candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. 
The aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin 
expression and its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 
to December 2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial 
arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed 
by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum 
sclerostin levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The prevalence of positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries 
was 56.25%. Sclerostin expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum 
sclerostin levels in patients with positive sclerostin expression were much 
higher than in those with negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic 
regression analyses including potential confounders as age, gender, systolic 
blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), 
phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that only serum sclerostin 
levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin expression (p = 0.025). The 
area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for predicting positive vessel 
sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity 
(p  = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin expression of serum 
sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive expression of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer 
was related to high serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local 
and systemic regulator involved in vascular calcification.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is associated 
with accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold increased risk of 
cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients die from complications 
directly attributed to atherosclerosis and their life expectancy is decreased. 
Established risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. 
Age, gender, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are 
among the established risk factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders 
(e.g. small dense low density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative 
stress represent emerging risk factors. The precise mechanism of atherosclerosis 
in patients with kidney failure is not yet known. CKD might represent a clinical 
model of atherogenesis. Thus, the evidence obtained from investigating "renal" 
atherogenesis could be of interest in improving our understanding of this 
disease process in the non-renal population. We review the relationship between 
"renal" and non-renal atherosclerosis focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and 
clinical events and how they interact with treatment options. Overall, the 
"later" stages of CKD may eventually be considered as a coronary heart disease 
equivalent condition.

AIM: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which 
increases morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is 
thrombosis, due to flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. 
This occurs not only due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones 
related to vascular atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has 
developed a simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular 
calcification and arterial stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several 
diagnostic procedures for VA surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive 
power for the detection of stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 
systemic factors, especially SCVS, on Qa.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained 
with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated 
correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were recorded 
and non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with them.
RESULTS: Pearson's corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851 (p-value 
<0.001). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p = 0.021), 
SCVS (p = 0.030), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on 
dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa varied significantly with diabetes status 
(p = 0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial 
pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender, 
hypertensive status and analitical parameters did not change the flow values.
CONCLUSION: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower DU-Qas, giving this 
method an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a simple method like 
SVCS may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations accordingly to risk 
stratification.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification independently predicts 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to 
evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification 
(TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal 
transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a 
large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry.
METHODS: Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 
48% males; 40% white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and 
follow-up TAC scores were derived.
RESULTS: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. Mean 
follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The 
overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and 
ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. 
After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, 
systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with 
incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a 
positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. 
Although the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% 
showed an annual score change of ≥100 and blacks showed the lowest median across 
ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering 
medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression.
CONCLUSIONS: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC 
incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change 
across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary 
calcification.

Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious 
problem in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and 
vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels 
to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in 
vitro was examined. HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels 
of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured 
in media containing phosphate levels comparable with those seen in 
hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 mM) showed dose-dependent increases in 
mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies showed that elevated phosphate treatment 
of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers 
osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMC were 
mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the 
ability of the specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently 
inhibit phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 
gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel 
type III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate 
HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offers a 
novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined the factors affecting 
peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. 
There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular calcification. In multivariate 
logistic regression, the significant factors affecting vascular calcification 
were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, increased phosphate 
concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. Our 
findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly stimulate HSMC to 
undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offer a novel 
explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There 
are limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in 
CKD, including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl).
METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial 
stiffness [measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing 
mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between 
non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months 
(12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral 
lumbar radiography at baseline.
RESULTS: Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m2] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 
88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m2) completed follow-up. There were no differences in 
age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 
[240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in 
the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and 
sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher 
AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV 
[9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, 
aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, 
p < 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from 
normal aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was 
associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m.
CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are associated 
with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year in individuals with 
CKD. Additionally, a significant association was found between serum FGF23 and 
arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further 
experimental work are warranted to delineate the temporal relationship as well 
as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality 
in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial 
effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the 
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and 
insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at 
different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, 
vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 
men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D 
[(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity 
(PWV) were evaluated.
RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and 
insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a 
significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean 
follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments 
(included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, 
albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as 
an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in 
this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular 
calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD 
patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.

Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality 
risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though 
common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no 
studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early 
stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 
proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine 
protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by 
electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the 
severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. 
However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, 
parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 
months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of 
calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both 
univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of 
calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the 
severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney 
disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies 
need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery 
calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

AIM: To evaluate the parathyroid ultrasonography and define parameters that can 
predict poor response to treatment in patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.
METHODS: This cohort study evaluated 85 patients with chronic kidney disease 
stage V with parathyroid hormone levels above 800 pg/mL. All patients underwent 
ultrasonography of the parathyroids and the following parameters were analyzed: 
Demographic characteristics (etiology of chronic kidney disease, gender, age, 
dialysis vintage, vascular access, use of vitamin D), laboratory (calcium, 
phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline 
phosphatase), and the occurrence of bone changes, cardiovascular events and 
death. The χ(2) test were used to compare proportions or the Fisher exact test 
for small sample frequencies. Student t-test was used to detect differences 
between the two groups regarding continuous variables.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (66.4%) had parathyroid nodules with higher levels 
of parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus. Sixteen patients underwent 
parathyroidectomy and had higher levels of phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus 
product (P = 0.03 and P = 0.006, respectively). They also had lower mortality 
(32% vs 68%, P = 0.01) and lower incidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
events (27% vs 73%, P = 0.02). Calcium × phosphorus product above 55 mg(2)/dL(2) 
[RR 1.48 (1.06, 2.08), P = 0.03], presence of vascular calcification [1.33 
(1.01, 1.76), P = 0.015] and previous occurrence of vascular events [RR 2.25 
(1.27, 3.98), P < 0.001] were risk factors for mortality in this population. 
There was no association between the occurrence of nodules and mortality.
CONCLUSION: The identification of nodules at ultrasonography strengthens the 
indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism 
due to renal failure.

BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, 
thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic 
hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on 
calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, 
endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease 
associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF).
METHODS: In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, 
we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of 
the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS 
patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed 
in six autopsy cases.
RESULTS: Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients 
and in none of the controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 
(33 %) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more 
severe neuropathy and ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower 
serum albumin levels, was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. 
Serum levels of creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the 
presence of calciphylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. 
Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 
may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different 
mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as 
a potential cause of calciphylaxis.

The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney 
transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher 
incidence of cardiovascular events compared with general population. 
Cardiovascular risk factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of 
patients starting dialysis or kidney transplantation already have signs of 
advanced atherosclerosis. Artery calcification is an organized, regulated 
process similar to bone formation. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is found 
frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and could be a useful marker of 
them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 stable renal transplant 
recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk factors 
associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and 
quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant 
recipients and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC 
were significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than 
recipients without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor 
of vascular calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients 
with CAC than those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 
patients, including 23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients 
and 2 CKD patients died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum 
amyloid A and the CAC score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of 
risk factors associated with atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning 
of renal failure.

PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for 
hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival 
remains unclear and results of several studies about this issue are 
controversial. In the light of the new knowledge about the different 
susceptibility for calcification process in different blood vessels, the aim of 
our study was to analyze whether the calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have 
an impact on AVF longevity.
METHODS: The study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them 
Caucasians, with a mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 
1 year with patent primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or 
in the anastomotic region was detected using X-ray examination.
RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary 
logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes 
mellitus and longer duration of AVF before calcification determination were 
associated with calcification of AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional 
hazard model adjusted for these standardized predicted values revealed that 
patients with present AVF-blood vessels calcification had increased risk to 
develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 (95% confidence interval 
1.00-11.67; P = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications of AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among 
dialysis patients and may jeopardize the survival of native AVF. We suggested 
the local X-ray as simple and valid method for detection of patients that are at 
risk for AVFs failure which should be monitored more closely.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in 
maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple 
assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is 
associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted 
a prospective study to investigate factors associated with the presence at 
baseline and progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic 
value in a short-term outcome.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 asymptomatic MHD 
patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 2+3). 
Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and 
biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years.
RESULTS: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients 
(37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An 
increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male 
patients who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 
years, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
Patients with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and 
the grade of AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates 
were significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were 
independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by 
chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in 
MHD patients.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis 
patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The 
aim of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications 
may have on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival.
METHODS: This study included 90 patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a 
native AVF treated by chronic hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The 
overall vascular calcification scores ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular 
access calcification score); patients were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 
36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification 
groups. AVF survival was then followed for 5 years after calcification 
measurement or until the patient's death/transplantation.
RESULTS: Patients with more pronounced vascular calcifications were more 
frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a 
significant relationship between calcification score and male gender, diabetes 
mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and intact 
parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal differences, 
Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification scores on 
AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 3.82 
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 
(CI 0.97-22.38).
CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse survival of native 
arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.

Renal artery calcium (RAC) has been shown to be associated with higher odds of 
hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence 
and extent of RAC is associated with renal function. We analyzed cross-sectional 
data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). A subsample of 1,226 
participants underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and also had venous 
blood samples measured for kidney function. RAC was the primary predictor 
variable and the following measures of kidney function were the outcome 
variables: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. The 
analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, height, visceral fat, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, interleukin-6 and 
abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). The average age of this cohort was 66.1 years 
(SD 9.7), 44.8% (549 of 1,226) were men, and nearly 30% had RAC >0. Compared 
with those with no RAC, those with RAC >0 were significantly older but not 
different by gender or race. After adjustment for age, gender, and race, those 
with RAC >0 had significantly higher visceral fat, were more likely to have 
dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, had a higher interleukin-6, and a 
higher prevalence of AAC >0. The mean eGFR and UACR among those without RAC were 
80 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 21 mg/g, whereas these values were 78 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 
55 mg/g among those with RAC. In fully adjusted multivariable linear regression 
models, the presence of RAC was associated with a lower eGFR (β = -2.21, 
p = 0.06) but not with UACR (β = 0.02, p = 0.79). In fully adjusted ordinal 
logistic regression, RAC as a continuous variable was associated with increased 
odds of being in a worse CKD category (odds ratio 1.14, p = 0.05). When measured 
by eGFR and CKD stage, there is a modest relation between RAC and kidney 
function. Further studies might involve clinical trials to assess the role of 
intensive cardiovascular disease risk factor management in patients with 
subclinical RAC to determine if this may prevent or delay the development and 
progression of CKD.

Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization 
and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla 
protein MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, 
data from 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were 
analyzed. Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) 
were compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular 
calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications 
were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, 
warfarin-treated male patients had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, 
p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly 
reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men (69.5 
vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the 
use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) 
and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified confounders were age, 
atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died 
during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, patients 
on warfarin had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, 
p=0.001) when compared with those untreated and data adjustment for confounders 
attenuated but confirmed the significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% 
CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In hemodialysis patients, additional studies are 
warranted to verify the risk/benefit ratio of warfarin, which appears to be 
associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality.

AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been 
emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic 
haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients 
are not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification 
between haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes.
METHODS: We examined 421 patients on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 
patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 
women, 62+/-10 years old) and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 
women, 59+/-13 years old). Hand roentgenography was carried out, and visible 
vascular calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic patients with 
vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in diabetic 
patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) ( p<0.001). In 
multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular 
calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of 
haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower 
predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular 
calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of 
haemodialysis. In diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk 
of calcification by 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029).
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have shown that poor glycaemic control, rather 
than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a predictor of peripheral vascular 
calcification in diabetic patients on haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that 
glycaemic control remains critical even in diabetic patients with end-stage 
renal disease.

Hypertension (HTN) develops very early in childhood chronic kidney disease 
(CKD). It is linked with rapid progression of kidney disease, increased 
morbidity and mortality hence the imperative to start anti-hypertensive 
medication when blood pressure (BP) is persistently > 90(th) percentile for age, 
gender, and height in non-dialyzing hypertensive children with CKD. HTN 
pathomechanism in CKD is multifactorial and complexly interwoven. The patient 
with CKD-associated HTN needs to be carefully evaluated for co-morbidities that 
frequently alter the course of the disease as successful treatment of HTN in CKD 
goes beyond life style modification and anti-hypertensive therapy alone. Chronic 
anaemia, volume overload, endothelial dysfunction, arterial media calcification, 
and metabolic derangements like secondary hyperparathyroidism, 
hyperphosphataemia, and calcitriol deficiency are a few co-morbidities that may 
cause or worsen HTN in CKD. It is important to know if the HTN is caused or made 
worse by the toxic effects of medications like erythropoietin, cyclosporine, 
tacrolimus, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Poor 
treatment response may be due to any of these co-morbidities and medications. A 
satisfactory hypertensive CKD outcome, therefore, depends very much on 
identifying and managing these co-morbid conditions and HTN promoting 
medications promptly and appropriately. This review attempts to point attention 
to factors that may affect successful treatment of the hypertensive CKD child 
and how to attain the desired therapeutic BP target.

BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), disorders of mineral 
metabolism are associated with vascular calcifications and mortality. 
Microvascular dysfunction, by affecting flow resistance and tissue perfusion, 
may explain the cardiovascular sequelae of CKD-associated disorders of mineral 
metabolism. We investigated whether advanced CKD is associated with a decrease 
in the functional and structural number of capillaries in skin and subsequently 
whether capillary rarefaction is related to mineral metabolism.
METHODS: Capillary density was measured by nailfold microscopy in 19 predialysis 
and 35 CKD Stage 5 (CKD5) patients and 19 controls. In CKD patients, calcium, 
phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25vitD3) and 
1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25vitD3) were analysed as well.
RESULTS: Capillary density at baseline was 42 ± 15/mm(2) in predialysis 
patients, 45 ± 17/mm(2) in CKD5 patients and 56 ± 20/mm(2) in controls (patients 
versus controls, respectively, P < 0.05 and P = 0.05). Absolute capillary 
recruitment during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia was 17 ± 7/mm(2), 14 ± 
6/mm(2) and 23 ± 8/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and 
controls). Capillary density during venous occlusion was 59 ± 20/mm(2), 59 ± 
21/mm(2) and 77 ± 21/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and 
controls). In multiple regression analysis, both serum phosphorus and 
bicarbonate values were independently and inversely associated with capillary 
density at baseline (r(2) of model = 19%) as well as during venous occlusion 
(r(2) of model = 28%). Furthermore, both serum phosphorus and bicarbonate were 
inversely and female gender positively correlated with capillary density during 
recruitment (r(2) of model = 37%).
CONCLUSION: Advanced CKD is characterized by an impaired functional and 
structural capillary density in skin, which is related to both high phosphorus 
and bicarbonate values.

PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with 
mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The 
aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between 
plasma FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery 
intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were 
measured in 229 patients who underwent coronary artery calcification scores 
(CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized tomography and CA-IMT assessed by 
using high-resolution color Doppler ultrasonography.
RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs was 98 (IQR 
0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 400) was 
28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, and 
the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level 
was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate 
(r = 0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the 
presence of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted 
ordinal regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for 
severe CACs together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis 
and CA-IMT (model r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was 
markedly higher in patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of 
phosphate levels (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the 
prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated 
with carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently fail to 
mature because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The pathogenesis of AVF 
nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing vascular pathologic states: medial 
fibrosis or microcalcification may limit arterial dilation, and intimal 
hyperplasia may cause stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50) undergoing 
AVF placement.
PREDICTORS: Medial fibrosis, microcalcification, and intimal hyperplasia in 
arteries and veins obtained during AVF creation.
OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: AVF nonmaturation.
RESULTS: AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38% of patients despite attempted salvage 
procedures. Preoperative arterial diameter was associated with upper-arm AVF 
maturation (P = 0.007). Medial fibrosis was similar in patients with nonmaturing 
and mature AVFs (60% ± 14% vs 66% ± 13%; P = 0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not 
associated with patient age or diabetes, although both variables were associated 
significantly with severe medial fibrosis. Conversely, AVF nonmaturation was 
higher in women than men despite similar medial fibrosis in both sexes. Arterial 
microcalcification (assessed semiquantitatively) tended to be associated with 
AVF nonmaturation (1.3 ± 0.8 vs 0.9 ± 0.8; P = 0.08). None of the arteries or 
veins obtained at AVF creation had intimal hyperplasia. However, repeated venous 
samples obtained in 6 patients during surgical revision of an immature AVF 
showed venous neointimal hyperplasia.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center study.
CONCLUSION: Medial fibrosis and microcalcification are frequent in arteries used 
to create AVFs, but do not explain AVF nonmaturation. Unlike previous studies, 
intimal hyperplasia was not present at baseline, but developed de novo in 
nonmaturing AVFs.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in 
dialysis patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A 
prolonged QT interval and arterial calcification have been associated with 
increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient 
populations including patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present 
study, we aimed to elucidate the association of vascular calcification with 
corrected QT interval duration in patients with end-stage renal disease.
METHODS: We performed a single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred 
for renal transplantation. Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with 
conduction abnormalities were excluded. Aortic calcifications were scored by 
means of lumbar X-rays.
RESULTS: In the final analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were 
included. A prolonged QT interval was observed in 26% of the patients. 
Multivariate analysis showed an independent and direct association between 
corrected QT duration and the extent of aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) 
independent of age, gender, cardiovascular history, electrolytes and parameters 
of mineral metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. 
Aortic calcification is associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of 
traditional determinants.

BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates 
inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological 
inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with 
generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q 
variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with 
end-stage renal failure.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 79 patients with end-stage renal failure 
undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the ENPP1 K121Q 
polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype (n=15) 
a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and 
duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary 
calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was 
measured by pulse-wave analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a significantly higher coronary 
calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30; P=0.033), and also a higher aortic pulse-wave 
velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK genotype (13.69 m/s 
vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 
K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification of patients with end-stage renal 
failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism have higher 
coronary calcification scores and increased aortic stiffness, and may benefit 
from more intense treatment in order to prevent progression of arterial 
calcification.

AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related 
risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate 
retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral 
metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation 
favourably impacts VC in the long-term.
METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) recipients 
who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC was 
compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting 
list.
RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT and 
CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no 
differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD 
between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree 
was observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage 
were associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT 
recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who 
experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT 
recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time after 
transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC 
compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more 
pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced 
by past dialysis experience.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients 
with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and 
mineral metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and 
fetuin A, as novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role 
of calcitonin, another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has 
not been studied in detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and the 
total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, 
in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 
and 87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the 
associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × 
phosphate product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact 
PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD.
RESULTS: The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, 
the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, 
and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 
0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, 
phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only 
calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged 
as independent predictors of Gensini score. In the second step, we adjusted for 
the presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and GFR. After these 
adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically significant 
predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components 
of mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater 
severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and 
nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger 
populations including patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased 
vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation 
of the calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains 
unclear. We investigated the association between bone turnover, the 
calcification inhibitors (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the 
phosphate regulating hormone; fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial 
stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with 
CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone 
turnover markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and 
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were 
determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), 
forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was assessed by contour 
analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a significant positive 
correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, p=0.023). Following 
multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were seen between 
serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) and SI(DVP) 
independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant relationship 
between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A significant 
negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SI(DVP) in CKD stage 4 
(r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following correction 
for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data suggest a 
link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis 
CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of 
these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD.

Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) 
disease. Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known 
CV risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine 
the prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients 
(RTRs). We conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by 
means of lumbar X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in 
a subgroup of 115 patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean 
follow-up of 36 months, 32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events 
in the PWV subgroup. When we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score 
(HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 
per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) remained an independent predictor of CV events in 
Cox-regression analyses. Using receiver operating characteristics, the area 
under the curve for predicting CV events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC 
and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC are strong predictors of future CV events 
in an incident RTR population. These vascular assessments are readily available 
and easy to perform, making them ideal tools for further risk stratification.

Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to 
mineral bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of 
vascular calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with 
measures of calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with 
end-stage renal disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in 
the serum of patients with epigastric and coronary artery calcification 
(calcification score 100 or more). In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin 
levels significantly associated with age, intact parathyroid hormone, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent calcification. Multivariable 
regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin each significantly 
associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. Receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) 
predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein 
expressions were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and 
non-calcified vessels, suggesting that the vasculature is not a major 
contributor to circulating levels. Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate 
with the extent of vascular calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery 
CT and scoring of epigastric artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers 
of mineral bone disorder, only sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but 
controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among 
chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and 
dyslipidemia in altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three 
different arterial locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid 
artery (ICA) origins. Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and 
its orifices were evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed 
tomography angiography in 397 patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted 
for age, gender, CKD, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking 
status. Additionally, subgroup analyses in each variable were conducted. Our 
multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that CKD was significantly 
associated with the outside-wall calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM 
was only associated with the inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we 
found that DM increased the association between CKD and arterial calcification 
at the aortic arch and its orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. 
Hypertension was significantly associated with the calcification at the orifices 
of the aortic arch branches synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have 
any significant association with calcification in any of the three vascular 
beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk of calcification in common with the 
three different vascular beds. CKD in combination with DM, as well as 
hypertension in combination with CKD, were key relationships affecting the risk 
of arterial calcification, especially at the aortic arch and its orifices.

BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is 
also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study 
was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality.
METHODS: we measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was 
followed during a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were 
applied, as during the follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney 
transplant and death.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of 
diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney 
transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher 
Scl and lower creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality 
and higher Scl (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes 
(HR=2.27), by competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of 
mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained 
significantly related to higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis 
patients. However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able 
to improve these patients survival needs to be determined.

Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 
contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor 
activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic 
mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using 
the SM22α promoter (SM22α-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old male 
SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium levels 
but lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and 
gender-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent 
of weight) of the leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not 
significantly different. No significant differences in these parameters were 
observed in female mice. Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits 
in the aortic roots of SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic 
differentiation and mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth 
muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated and cultured. Results showed that SM22α-Rankl 
( tg ) SMCs had higher baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but not 
baseline matrix calcification. When induced by the PKA agonist forskolin, ALP 
activity was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Real-time RT-qPCR 
revealed higher baseline expression of ALP and ankylosis genes but lower 
osteoprotegerin gene in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. Matrix mineralization induced 
by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT 
SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP inhibitor levamisole abolished 
forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not inorganic phosphate-induced 
matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that RANKL overexpression in the 
vasculature may promote mineralization potential.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated 
with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, 
hypertension and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to 
measure VCs in long-HD patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, 
with the occasional use of sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to 
identify the associated factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate.
METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre using a semi-quantitative score 
ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and extent of VCs. The following 
patients' characteristics were compared according to their VC scores: medical 
history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline 
phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses were 
also performed.
RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were studied; the mean age 
was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects were females, 35% were diabetics, and 
they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months (median: 45 months) with a 3 
x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l dialysate calcium and providing a 
mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients were free from VCs and 11% had 
severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were classified into 'classic' (age, 
diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, more frequent warfarin 
treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 'non-traditional' 
(higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and low 
alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with 
a score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared 
to patients with a 0 score.
CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83%) of VCs 
in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy and adherence 
to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic factors such as ageing 
and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure and phosphataemia 
that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association with FGF-23 
serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The harmful 
effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and optimization 
of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: In spite of numerous interventions, the control of mineral 
disturbances remains poor in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Chronic 
kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) represent an important 
cause of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to analyze the 
relationship between mineral and bone disorders (MBD) and their components 
impact on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CDV) mortality and morbidity 
in chronic dialysis patients.
METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in a cohort of 92 randomly 
selected patients with ESRF treated with hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal 
dialysis (PD). The data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were 
recorded, including vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral). The 
follow-up lasted 40 months and the final evaluation included the number and 
causes of deaths, CDV events and disease. Serum Ca, P, ALP, iPTH, albumin, 
cholesterol, urea and creatinine levels were measured. The plain radiographic 
films of hands and pelvis evaluated all bone abnormalities suggestive of renal 
osteodystrophy (ROD) and peripheral vascular calcification (VC).
RESULTS: All-cause annual mortality represented 9.25% in HD and 9.09% in PD 
patients. The CDV mortality represented almost 44% in HD patients and 66% in PD 
patients from all deaths. There was a high prevalence of CDV diseases and 
events. High and low serum P levels were associated with a worse survival rate. 
Hypercalcaemia was associated with high risk for CDV events in HD patients. In 
PD patients, the relationship between increased ALP levels and all-cause 
mortality was significant. Other mineral markers were not predictive of the 
outcome in the studied patients. In the HD patients the severity of VC was 
associated with all-cause and CDV mortality, and with CDV events. Male gender, 
hypercholesterolemia, decreased URR, albumin and creatinine were identified as 
risk factors for all-cause mortality. The diabetics had higher death rates. Low 
dialysis efficacy represented a risk factor for mortality and CDV diseases and 
events. In PD patients, low albumin induced a higher death rate. In PD patients 
the death rate was similar to HD patients.
CONCLUSION: All-cause mortality was higher than in general population, but lower 
than the chronic dialysis patients' mortality reported in other studies. The 
death rates in HD and PD patients were similar. VC and serum P levels influenced 
the outcome in the HD patients - increased the risk for all-cause and CDV 
mortality, but also for CDV events. ALP levels influenced outcome in PD 
patients. There were no significant differences between HD and PD patients 
regarding outcome.

BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases 
osteoblastogenesis. Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in 
vascular calcification (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) 
patients, serum sclerostin levels are high.
AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, bone mineral 
density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to 
correlate serum sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification 
score, BMD scores and survival rate.
RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin level of 1.9 ± 
0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum sclerostin levels 
(0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were significantly 
older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male gender (74 
vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 ± 9 vs. 
20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed lower 
aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD scores. 
Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate 
compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 
95% CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use.
CONCLUSION: Our study of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels 
are associated with higher BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better 
survival rate.

PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard 
for evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and 
less costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral 
arteries has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome 
predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of 
abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in 
predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), 
maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients.
METHODS: Four hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and 
pelvic radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated 
according to the methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et 
al. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years.
RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with the correlation coefficients of 
0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC 
score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher prevalence of DM and had 
higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and eGFR. A more severe 
degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, whereas a more 
severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function and prolonged 
dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a 
significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, 
whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all 
three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, 
whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three 
populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, 
gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the 
predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients.
CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT 
patients.

AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid 
artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the 
relationship between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim 
of this study was to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque 
(CAP) in patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to 
the development of CAAC and CAP.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The 
prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC 
and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. 
A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was 
significantly associated with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, 
calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and CAP. In contrast, in the same 
analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with age, male gender, diabetes, 
intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the multivariate analysis, 
CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and calcium-phosphorus 
product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant for CAP. 
Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
(OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a 
high OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51).
CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or 
non-traditional risk factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different from those 
of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be an independent risk factor for each 
other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong relationship between carotid 
calcification and atherosclerosis.

We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 
+/- 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 
+/- 17 years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were 
characterized by a good mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 
+/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product 
(46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone 
levels were higher in HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was 
found to be highly prevalent in both groups. Significantly more HD patients 
(62.5%) showed cardiac calcification than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The 
patients were matched for TC scores higher or lower than 400. The two groups 
differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus 
(p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone 
level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval 
was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores (approximately 11%), 
but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients with TC scores 
>400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in both groups (r 
= 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, age, time 
(months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium x 
phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and 
cardiac calcification in uraemic patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a major component of uremic syndrome, 
cardiovascular disease is largely responsible for the high mortality observed in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have evidenced an association 
between serum levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and 
vascular alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association 
between serum IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a 
cohort of CKD patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: One-hundred and thirty-nine 
patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at different stages of CKD (8% 
at stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at stage 5, and 32% at stage 
5D) were enrolled.
RESULTS: Baseline IS levels presented an inverse relationship with renal 
function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification and pulse wave 
velocity. During the follow-up period (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly 
because of cardiovascular events (n = 18). In crude survival analyses, the 
highest IS tertile was a powerful predictor of overall and cardiovascular 
mortality (P = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The predictive power of IS for 
death was maintained after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, albumin, 
hemoglobin, phosphate, and aortic calcification.
CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here indicates that IS may have a significant 
role in the vascular disease and higher mortality observed in CKD patients.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in 
chronic kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The 
mechanism is unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular 
calcification, femoral bone density and left ventricular mass in patients with 
stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational 
study.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% 
male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 
ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using lateral 
lumbar spine radiography and was present in 48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured 
using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic 
resonance imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One patient had 
left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic calcification had higher left 
ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 
0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 
g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification 
correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean femoral 
Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 0.004). 
In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic 
calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 
46% of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower 
mean femoral Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently 
associated with increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the 
pathophysiology that underlies these relationships is warranted.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in 
the general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of 
BMI on CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney 
disease not on dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, 
dialysis initiation, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients.
METHODS: CKD patients were divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, 
initiation of dialysis, and extent and progression of CAC were assessed. 
Univariate and multivariable analysis were performed (adjustment variables: age, 
diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, 
parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, C-reactive protein, 
LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour proteinuria). Patients were 
followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 years.
RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 
0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not 
increase the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) 
or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did 
not increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% 
CI: 0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; 
p = 0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration 
rate) to other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly 
increased (HR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI 
was not a predictor of CAC extent or progression.
CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High BMI increased the risk 
for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to CAC extent and 
progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact of high 
BMI on dialysis initiation.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major 
causes of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
are a family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in 
atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of 
atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G) 
and MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery 
calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal 
failure (ESRD) and all-cause mortality risk in HD.
METHODS: Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up for 36 months, and 133 matched 
controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD patients' characteristics 
were age 64 +/- 13 years, males 64%, diabetic 24%, hypertensive 62%, smokers 
38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all undergoing standard HD thrice weekly.
RESULTS: ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A 
homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G/2G and 
6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was 
associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, 
diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, 
dialysis vintage and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P 
= 0.01. A trend for the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity 
was also observed: HR 3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 
6A/6A homozygosity significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox 
regression model: HR 4.69 (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MMP-1 and 
MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors for all-cause 
mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. These 
data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis 
of the increased mortality in HD patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and 
stiffness.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured in 351 
participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic 
Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was 
measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear 
regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, 
and pulse wave velocity.
RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female gender, 
greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was not 
associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum 
phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with 
concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum 
OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for 
demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors 
such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, 
presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein 
or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161).
CONCLUSIONS: These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and 
arterial stiffness independent of many potential confounders including 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, 
and inflammation.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of 
calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves 
in adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis.
BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic 
heart disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience 
accelerated vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of 
mineral metabolism. Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD 
have not been identified. Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as 
measured by electron-beam tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis 
patients who received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular 
calcification. We compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of 
atherosclerotic vascular disease and determined correlates of the extent of 
vascular and valvular calcification using multivariable linear regression and 
proportional odds logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 (interquartile range, 
76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of obstructive coronary artery 
disease in the general population. The CA calcium scores were directly related 
to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and angina (p < 0.0001), 
and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of 
claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of coronary 
calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, 
diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and 
phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density 
lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not 
significantly related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage 
was significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification.
CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly 
associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The 
dysregulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification 
risk.

PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is 
cardiovascular disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular 
calcification. Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been 
published, but these measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used 
computed tomography to determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data 
as prognostic markers for cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: Computed tomography with contrast medium was performed on 49 patients 
undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average age, 68.9 ± 11.0 
years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the volume of 
vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients were 
monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or 
hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic 
abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg 
amputation, and hospitalization or death due to heart failure.
RESULTS: Patients were followed for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end 
point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly 
associated with cardiovascular events. In contrast, events were not related to 
age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, maximum intima-media 
thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, or left 
ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a 
high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional 
computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on 
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and 
cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) 
patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular 
calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, 
which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this 
study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some 
biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients.
METHODS: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age, 
gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from 
all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), 
phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, 
fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by 
biochemical methods.
RESULTS: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were significantly 
higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and albumin were 
significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a significant 
correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In 
addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant 
only in the patient group.
CONCLUSION: In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were 
observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2 parameters may 
potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation and prediction of 
vascular complications in these patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA) 
calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease 
and has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We 
sought to determine the association between the risk factors for vascular 
calcification and this rare phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure, 
and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for 
vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a 
discharge diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head examinations were 
reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for 
the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) 
cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes).
RESULTS: STA calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. 
The prevalence of cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA 
calcification and 9.3% (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 
2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208; P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk 
of STA calcification. The risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to 
STA calcification (P=0.221).
CONCLUSION: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the 
risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, 
hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are 
not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to STA calcification but has 
the strongest association with diabetes mellitus.

It is uncertain whether moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) or measures of 
kidney function are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis as represented 
by coronary artery calcium (CAC) or abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). We used 
logistic and linear regression analyses to relate CKD (glomerular filtration 
rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), cystatin C (cysC), and microalbuminuria (MA) with 
CAC and AAC obtained using multidetector computed tomography in Framingham Heart 
Study Offspring participants (mean age 59 years, 55.3% women). Increased CAC and 
AAC were defined as > or =90th percentile age- and gender-specific cutpoints 
based on a healthy referent sample. Major cardiovascular disease risk factors 
were accounted for in multivariable models. Of 1,179 participants, 1,174 had AAC 
measurements and 1,147 had CAC measurements, 6.3% had CKD, and 8.3% had MA. CKD 
was not associated with CAC (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] for CKD 
1.18, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 2.36, p = 0.63) or AAC 
(multivariable-adjusted OR for CKD 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 2.04, p 
= 0.73). CysC was associated with CAC in age- and gender-adjusted but not in 
multivariable models (age- and gender-adjusted OR for log cysC per SD increment 
and CAC 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.41, p = 0.04; 
multivariable-adjusted OR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.38, p = 0.15). 
MA was not associated with CAC (OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.61, p 
= 0.54). Neither cysC nor MA was significantly associated with AAC in age- and 
gender- or multivariable-adjusted models. In conclusion, CKD, cysC, and MA are 
not associated with CAC or AAC when accounting for cardiovascular disease risk 
factors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as 
an important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
calcification over 24 mo.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 134 patients (60 on 
hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 chronic kidney 
disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial femoral artery 
was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave velocity; 
all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
baseline and 12 and 24 mo.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. Progressive calcification 
was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients with an initial 
calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The hemodialysis 
group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who were on 
peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, 
beta blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification 
correlated with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present 
in 20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified 
change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low 
albumin as risk factors for death.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and preexisting 
vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification over 24 mo. 
Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and 
mortality.

Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an 
important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch 
calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using 
plain chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk 
factors for AoAC progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated 
hemodialysis patients and 59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who 
had undergone chest radiography before initial dialysis therapy and every year, 
we estimated AoACS and then divided the patients into two groups based on the 
presence or absence of AoAC progression. We also compared the baseline clinical 
and biochemical profiles in the two groups. Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean 
age, 58.6 ± 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients (41.3%) had AoAC before initial 
dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 ± 20.4%. The mean duration of follow-up was 
2.7 ± 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had progressive AoAC. Age >65 years 
(p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes (p = 0.015), and the 
presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC progression. No 
significant association was found between AoAC progression and the baseline 
clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis 
modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the 
presence of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC 
progression in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the 
presence of AoAC before initial dialysis were significantly related to the 
progression of AoAC in these patients. The results suggest that patients should 
be carefully managed from the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and 
to reduce cardiovascular morbidity.

Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common 
in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. 
The Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances 
seen in CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to 
investigate the possible association of circulating concentrations of the 
secreted Wnt signaling inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial 
stiffness in predialysis CKD. Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 
(SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. 
Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were analyzed. BMD was measured at the 
lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), and forearm (FARM). 
Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour analysis of digital volume 
pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between sclerostin and age (r 
= 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p = 0.013). 
Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association 
between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association 
between sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 
0.002). In contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 
0.038). A negative association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). 
Our data suggest that the Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective 
studies are required to establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 
as serological markers in CKD.

The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include 
duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, 
hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was 
performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis 
population.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent plain 
x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or 
negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 
1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
(P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact 
parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences 
between PVC and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 
34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = 
.19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium 
and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not different between the two groups (P 
= .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were 
older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater 
incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001). In 
conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the duration of 
dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 
were not significantly associated with vascular calcifications, but it was not 
possible to exclude a role for these and other factors in patients with longer 
dialysis.

BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular 
events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement 
of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the 
incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG 
levels with morbidity and mortality in subjects who became new HD patients 
between June 2000 and May 2006.
RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 34 female) 
were prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this period, 27 
patients developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related to 
cardiovascular disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the 
high OPG group showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality compared with the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis 
associated the new onset of cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 
2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start 
of HD was significantly associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic 
calcification index.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients may predict 
subsequent cardiovascular events.

BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is 
increasingly recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. 
Circulating levels of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. 
The present study investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are 
associated with all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: We performed a post-hoc survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients 
(68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 2006 who were prospectively followed for 
median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters of mineral metabolism including 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum sclerostin were determined 
in spare blood samples collected at baseline.
RESULTS: Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) 
[median (iqr)] pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were 
characterized by older age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower 
bsAP concentration. During a median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. 
Higher circulating sclerostin levels were associated with decreased mortality in 
prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); 
HR adjusted for age and gender for serum sclerostin levels above versus below 
median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When bsAP was entered in the Cox 
regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in 
the causal pathway.

Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In patients with 
chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of coronary calcification 
are increased. It has remained uncertain whether it is the intima of the 
coronaries or the media that is calcified and whether the morphologic details of 
calcified plaques differ between renal and nonrenal patients. Autopsy samples of 
coronaries were obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and 
gender-matched nonuremic patients. Specimens were examined using light and 
electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray 
analysis. In coronaries, calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the 
intima area in renal versus nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/- 
11.9%) but occupied a significantly higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 
10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive 
protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was significantly more intensive around 
coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal patients. The 
non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients showed minimal staining for fetuin, 
but fetuin staining was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, more 
pronounced deposition of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal 
patients, and glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage 
in renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more 
intense in the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal 
compared with nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal 
patients is suggested by more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers 
of inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification represents a marker of cardiovascular 
risk in chronic dialysis patients. In the general population, aortic arch 
calcification (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a 
prospective study to investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis 
patients and examined its prognostic value in long-term outcome.
METHODS: A total of 712 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. AAC was identified 
on postero-anterior chest X-ray films and classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 
3. Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and 
biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The patients were followed for 10 
years.
RESULTS: AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) as Gr. 1, in 116 patients (16.3%) 
as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An increase in the severity of 
calcification was associated with older patients who had lower albumin, higher 
calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10 years, we found 
that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular mortality (Gr. 0: 
5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p < 0.05) and all-cause 
mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3: 53.2%; p < 
0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
Patients with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The 
severity of AAC also influenced their survival.
CONCLUSION: Calcification of the aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography 
was an important determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in 
chronic hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted 
long-term survival.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density 
(BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated 
associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery 
calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD 
quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with 
mortality.
METHODS: In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising 
incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and 
recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and 
CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of 
the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation 
biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed.
RESULTS: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 
and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 
AUs) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. 
In Cox proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with 
all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, 
inflammation and subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error 
of prediction (RMSE) showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD 
evaluated from DXA. In receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, 
lower VBD was more strongly associated with higher CAC score and all-cause 
mortality than BMD evaluated from DXA.
CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of 
agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger 
than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low 
VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve 
as an important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by 
uremia-specific factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors 
involved in its regulation, and in the vascular calcification process.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In an unselected population of 
177 patients with calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 
the link between the mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, 
calcium-phosphorus product), regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH], 
intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin 
A), and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary 
angiography were evaluated in three subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini 
lesion severity score.
RESULTS: The mean serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population was 
28.1 ± 17.3 RU/ml and for fetuin A was 473.1 ± 156.2 μg/ml. Patients with eGFR < 
60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with 
patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The Gensini score values 
significantly correlated with gender; arterial hypertension; and HDL 
cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. After the adjustments for 
traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 and 
fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini score.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with 
mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels 
appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for 
extent of CAD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to 
low bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the 
latter are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary 
artery calcium (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). 
In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree 
of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens 
collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the 
patients, 26% had osteopenia and 7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery 
biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score 
(>100 Agatston units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs 
of leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with 
extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, 
lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive 
VC, and patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score. Both high 
CAC and extensive VC were independently predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD 
has the potential to identify ESRD patients at risk of vascular calcification.

Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been 
consistently related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This 
study evaluated the association between PF and coronary artery calcification 
(CAC) in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a 
post-hoc cross sectional analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 
outward CKD patients without manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 
years, 64.1% males, 95.1% hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, 
CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). 
CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by 
computed tomography. The association of PF as a continuous variable with the 
presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. CAC (calcium 
score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those presenting CAC were on average 
10 years older, had a higher proportion of male gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 
0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 
13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and 
AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the multivariate 
analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left ventricular 
concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the presence of CAC 
(OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained associated with 
CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular filtration rate or 
serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is independently 
associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative 
contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients 
CKD stages 3-4.
METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), 
were studied in 178 patients.
RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with age, 
male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, 
but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP 
increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, 
and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients with none (KI 
= 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with 
severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic response to 
FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the 
independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also 
identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a 
patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained 
unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased 
in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9.
CONCLUSIONS: In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with 
FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular 
calcification (VC), on survival.
METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors completed 40 months of 
follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the superficial 
femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard clinical 
biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had died (27 men and 4 women). 
Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The majority of deaths were 
in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD subjects. The 
outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate 
logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 
0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 
0.26 (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death.
CONCLUSION: We have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in 
CKD stages 4 and 5 over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, 
independent of CRP, is also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms 
remain to be elucidated; however, it is likely that they are associated with 
vascular damage through mechanisms in addition to VC.

The aim of the present study was to use intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) to 
assess plaque morphology and morphometry in patients with varying degrees of 
chronic renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
dialysis replacement. Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death for 
patients with chronic renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with ESRD. 
The impact of several degrees of renal insufficiency (including ESRD) on 
coronary plaque characteristics has not been determined. A total of 142 patients 
who underwent IVUS imaging of a de novo native coronary artery stenosis before 
percutaneous intervention were matched for age, gender, and diabetes and were 
grouped according to calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl): CrCl >70 ml/min (n 
= 39); CrCl 50 to 69 ml/min (n = 41); CrCl <50 ml/min, (n = 37), and ESRD (n = 
25). Standard clinical, angiographic, and IVUS parameters were measured. The 
ESRD group had more African-American (p = 0.002) and hypertensive (p = 0.002) 
patients. No significant difference was found in any of the IVUS measurements 
among patients with CrCl >70, 50 to 69, and <50 ml/min: reference and lesion 
site arterial, lumen, and plaque areas and volumes, and arterial calcium (p = NS 
for all comparisons). Conversely, patients with ESRD had larger reference 
segment arterial and lumen areas and volumes; larger lesion site arterial, 
lumen, and plaque areas; and larger arcs of calcium (p <0.05 for all post hoc 
comparisons between patients with ESRD and patients with CrCl >70, 50 to 69, and 
<50 ml/min). Thus, chronic renal insufficiency in the absence of dialysis is not 
associated with increased reference segment or lesion site plaque burden and 
calcium. However, the transition to the need for dialysis is associated with 
progressive calcific atherosclerosis (larger lesion plaque area and calcium).

Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.

AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those 
patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has 
been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in 
patients with CKD. However, the role of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains 
unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between FGF23 and 
LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, and arterial stiffness in 
48 stable PD patients.
METHODS: Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D 
echocardiography. Intact FGF23 blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit 
(Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a 
surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a 
surrogate marker of arterial stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral 
arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed 
using the Adragão score.
RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi 
(r = 0.487, p < 0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 
0.535, p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, 
p = 0.027) and was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), 
residual renal function (r = -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). 
In multivariate adjusted analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p 
= 0.041), serum Pi (β = 0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) 
independent of dialysis vintage, gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, 
C-reactive protein and systolic blood pressure. There were no associations found 
between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in multivariable- adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is associated with LVH but not with 
endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or vascular calcification in PD 
patients.

AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis 
(HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship 
between the progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF)-23.
METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD patients. 
Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a score 
(AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination.
RESULTS: The percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser 
than in regressors (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis 
duration in regressors (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors 
(19.5±7.0 years) and progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum 
FGF-23 level in regressors (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than 
in non-progressors (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 
pg/mL). Multi-ple regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, 
F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) 
and log FGF-23 (β value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent 
determinants of ΔAoACS.
CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD 
patients.

Lake City, UT, USA.

BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent 
by-stander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a 
pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased 
mortality in hemodialysis patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants.
PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated 
with older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well 
as higher serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower 
parathyroid hormone levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal 
range in both groups, but the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly 
higher values. In a multivariate time-dependent Cox model using baseline and 
follow-up values of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for 
demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and 
liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly 
associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 - 
1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.57).
LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality 
in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver 
enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in 
hemodialysis patients.

It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are 
simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone 
health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney 
disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of 
microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery 
calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture 
of the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography 
(HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the 
lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery 
calcification using multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured 
in 66 patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of 
bone turnover, vitamin D status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were 
assessed. CAC score was found to be <100 in 39% and ≥100 in 61% of patients. The 
median [95% CI] total CAC score was 282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis, 
significant correlations between CAC and age (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3, 
p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, p<0.01) were found, and parameters 
of bone microarchitecture were numerically but not significantly lower in 
patients with CAC scores ≥100. In multivariate analysis stratifying for gender 
and correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone volume/total volume 
(BV/TV) were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100 (p<0.05 for 
both). Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone density are 
associated with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.

Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both 
divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical 
differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the 
entity and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery 
calcium score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard 
markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla 
protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 
30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 
5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 
males,19 females; D duration 5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium 
score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx 
patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower 
prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 
3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward 
normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was 
evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 
0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 
0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also 
with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, 
notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected 
previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive 
protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive 
parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D 
duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, 
as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification 
inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated 
with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize 
the accelerating role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. 
Assessment of both coronary calcifications and serum levels of calcification 
inhibitory proteins may be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of 
development and progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the 
highest rate.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients.
METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and 
gender-matched nondialysis control subjects were evaluated by echocardiography 
and a severity score for VC was determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was 
evaluated at the beginning of haemodialysis.
RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients than in normal 
patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% vs 4.3%, P = 
0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older than 
patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, had 
longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) 
and the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also 
found a positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No 
correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid 
hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most 
predictive parameters for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification 
was associated more frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, 
valvular insufficiency and with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic 
calcification was correlated with age (r = 0.42) and longer duration of 
predialysis arterial hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and 
selected age and calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. 
These findings support careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the 
early stages of end-stage renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among 
persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic 
bone disease, vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. 
Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
phosphate levels; however, the relationship between PTX and survival is not 
known.
METHODS: We conducted an observational matched cohort study utilizing data from 
the United States Renal Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients 
undergoing a first PTX while on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were 
individually matched by age, race, gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, 
prior transplantation status, and dialysis modality to 4558 control patients who 
did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed from the date of PTX until they died 
or were lost to follow-up.
RESULTS: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. 
Long-term relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated 
to be 10% to 15% lower than those of matched control patients not undergoing 
surgery. Survival curves between the 2 groups crossed 587 days following PTX. 
Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 
months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control group.
CONCLUSION: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, 
mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to 
attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients 
with end-stage renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating 
calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is 
associated with inflammation and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present 
study, we evaluated the association between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and 
outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the 
protein product and outcome.
METHODS: In a cohort of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement 
therapy [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 
years the following parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition 
(subjective global assessment), comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical 
manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, 
fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid positions Thr248Met (C-->T), 
Thr256Ser (C-->G), Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys (C-->T).
RESULTS: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) mortality 
were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking, 
diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 
vs. 0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) 
patients had significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and 
well-nourished ESRD patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N= 
101), fetuin-A was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of 
carotid plaques independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and 
inflammation. Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both 
S-albumin (Rho = 0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01). Patients 
with the AHSG 256Ser allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher 
all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rate if they were inflamed.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that a low fetuin-A level is associated with 
malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (carotid plaques), as well as 
with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Because the present study 
demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on both circulating 
fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with the AHSG 
256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). We examined the cross-sectional association between novel 
risk factors and coronary artery calcium (CAC) measured using electron beam 
computed tomography or multidetector computed tomography among 2,018 patients 
with CKD. Using the total Agatston scores, the participants were classified as 
having no (0), moderate (>0-100), or high (>100) CAC. After adjustment for age, 
gender, race, study sites, cigarette smoking, previous cardiovascular disease, 
hypertension, and diabetes, the use of lipid-lowering drugs, body mass index, 
waist circumference, and cystatin C, several novel risk factors were 
significantly associated with high CAC. For example, the odds ratios of high CAC 
associated with 1 SD greater level of risk factors were 1.20 (95% confidence 
interval 1.04 to 1.38) for serum calcium, 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 
1.41) for serum phosphate, 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.97) for log 
(total parathyroid hormone), 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.43) for log 
(homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance), and 1.23 (95% confidence 
interval 1.04 to 1.45) for hemoglobin A1c. Additionally, the 
multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 1 SD greater level of cystatin C was 1.31 
(95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.50). Serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein, 
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and homocysteine were not statistically 
significantly associated with high CAC. In conclusion, these data indicate that 
abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, insulin resistance, and declining 
kidney function are associated with the prevalence of high CAC, independent of 
the traditional risk factors in patients with CKD. Additional studies are 
warranted to examine the causal effect of these risk factors on CAC in patients 
with CKD.

Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in 
vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery 
intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque 
identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and 
monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated 
FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in 
maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma 
FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and 
CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred 
twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 
years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice a week) 
were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing tertiles of plasma 
FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, P<0.0001). Log 
plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free of 
plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was 
recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple 
regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant 
independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to 
clarify whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential 
mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

OBJECTIVES: Kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased incidence 
of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and posttransplant diabetes 
mellitus that promote the development of coronary artery calcification (CAC). 
The aim of the current study was to elucidate the extent of CAC and its risk 
factors among KT patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the severity of CAC 
in our KT patients. Multidetector computed tomography was performed to assess 
the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were further stratified 
according to the CACS as: group 1: 0-10, group 2: 11-100, group 3: 101-300, 
group 4: 301-1000, and group 5: >1000. Clinical as well as demographic data were 
compared among groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine 
factors that were associated with CAC.
RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 
53.5 ± 11.8 years and duration of follow-up post-KT was 11.2 ± 5.9 years. The 
distribution of CACS in groups 1 through 5 was: 41.4%, 20.2%, 11.1%, 15.2%, and 
12.1%, respectively. A significantly higher CACS was found in males, patients 
with pretransplant diabetes mellitus, older current age, older age at KT, 
hypertension, higher body weight, higher fasting plasma sugar level and lower 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Twenty-nine (29.3%) patients 
fulfilled criteria for metabolic syndrome (MS). The CACS was significantly 
higher in patients with MS than in those without MS. An incremental CACS was 
found to be correlated with increasing number of MS components (P = .003). 
Multivariate linear regression revealed that female gender, current age, 
hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were associated with CAC.
CONCLUSION: KT was associated with high CACS in a significant proportion of 
patients with long-term follow-up. Several risk factors were identified. Some of 
them were potentially treatable and should be taken into consideration in the 
management of KT recipients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with 
hemodialysis.
METHODS: As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving maintenance 
hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. According to the 
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 
25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 ηg/ml or less than 30 ηg/ml) and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (>30 ηg/ml). All of the subjects 
underwent lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree 
of calcification (Kauppila score).
RESULTS: Among the 126 patients treated with MHD, there were 110 patients with 
25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
level. There was no significant difference found in gender, age, age of 
dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the two groups. 
The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with normal 
25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had a 
negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P = 0.193). 
Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor for 
vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is 
generally low in patients with MHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a higher 
incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative correlation. Thus, 
for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D deficiency should be actively 
treated.

Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality 
in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify 
risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with 
this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was 
found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray 
(arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, 
diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors 
for access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate 
analysis. Serum parameters were not independently related to access 
calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox 
regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an 
independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular 
access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at 
increased mortality risk.

BACKGROUND: Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of 
vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular 
calcifications are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key 
role in bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular 
calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors 
and OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate 
cut-off value to predict CAC.
METHODS: A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of kidney 
disease [75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)] were enrolled, 
excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest 
multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected 
for measurement of vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation, 
nutrition, calcium phosphate and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and 
these biological markers was investigated, and a receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value 
of involved markers that best predicted the presence of CAC.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, among 
biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high FEPO(4) [OR 
= 3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high OPG levels [OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11)] were associated 
with the presence of CAC. A protective effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D [OR = 
0.20 (0.05-0.79)] and LDL cholesterol [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also 
observed. ROC curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting 
CAC was 757.7 pg/mL.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated 
with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pg/mL allow 
us to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.

BACKGROUND: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression 
of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based 
phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for 
cardiovascular events, risk equations are needed.
METHODS: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis treated at one center in France 
included biochemical values during the year prior to study entry, patient 
characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 years. As 
arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified using a 
0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography 
(EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to 
all patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox 
proportional hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree 
of calcification, controlling for other characteristics.
RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average 
follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered an event. The calcification score, diabetes, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure, gender, smoking and 
hypertension are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. The resulting 
equation indicates that, relative to a calcification score below 400, the risk 
of an initial event increases 44% for a score of 600, and more than doubles for 
a score of 1000.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of long-term follow-up studies, these equations 
permit quantification of the expected long-term clinical consequences of the 
impact of various phosphate binders on vascular calcification. Together with 
resource use and cost information, these equations are key inputs for formal 
cost-effectiveness analyses.

PURPOSE: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian 
patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF).
METHODS: Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. 
Predictors of patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency 
rates.
RESULTS: Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 
58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. 
Univariate analysis showed that factors which predict for patency include male 
gender (p = 0.003), good diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031), 
pre-dialysis status (p = 0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and 
non-calcified radial arteries (p = 0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein 
diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 0.472) did not predict for primary 
AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the male gender to be an independent 
predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). Subset analysis showed a 
significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 mm amongst males, as 
compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no statistical difference in 
the average cephalic vein diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Within our Asian study population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF 
is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months 
and 54% at 72 months. Male gender is an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. 
In females or patients with calcified radial arteries, a more proximal AVF 
should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and common 
complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this 
study was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a 2-year period and to 
identify the factors that may be associated with CAC progression in ESRD 
patients.
METHODS: The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable haemodialysis 
patients who initially entered into the study. The study population underwent 
multirow spiral computed tomography to derive CAC scores at baseline and after a 
minimum of 12 months (24 months in 30 patients, 18 months in four, and 12 months 
in the remaining six patients). To provide a stable estimate that was unbiased 
with respect to the baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores were used 
for the analyses of the changes in CAC.
RESULTS: The median CAC score was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm3 at baseline and 
increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm3 at follow-up (P < 0.001) and the median 
annualized change in square root-transformed CAC score was 1.48 (range, 
-0.95-8.64) mm3/year. The annualized change of the square root-transformed CAC 
score positively correlated with the time-integrated levels of C-reactive 
protein (R = 0.521, P = 0.001), phosphorus (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x 
phosphorus product (R = 0.394, P = 0.012), but did not correlate with the levels 
of fetuin-A or lipid parameters. Even after adjusting for age, gender and 
baseline CAC score, C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with 
CAC progression.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that chronic inflammation as well as altered 
mineral metabolism contributes to a rapid progression of CAC in ESRD patients. 
Additional, larger scale studies are required to confirm our findings.

Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with 
an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the 
majority of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data 
are discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross 
sectional study we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary 
artery and thoracic aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam 
tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. 
Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans were performed within a week of 
each other. There was no difference between races in age, systolic blood 
pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent history of 
hypertension (100% versus 89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (30% 
versus 66%; P<0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 
pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% 
versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% 
versus 28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, 
as well as CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this 
dialysis cohort there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black 
and white patients despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. 
Epidemiological data from the general population indicate that Blacks have lower 
calcium scores and stiffer vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal 
populations suggest a better and others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites 
on hemodialysis. Our findings raise the important question of the prognostic 
significance of markers of vasculopathy in patients of different races and with 
different risk profiles.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endotoxin (ET) is recognized to cause adverse effects 
on cardiovascular (CV) structure. Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET 
is described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older 
people and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore 
studied ET after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of 
optimized antihypertensive therapy (AHT).
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We recruited 40 hypertensive 
nondiabetic patients (≥70 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 and hypertensive 
non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was performed after complete AHT washout 
and repeated after AHT reintroduction to target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by applanation tonometry, central 
hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave analysis, vascular calcification 
(VC) by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay.
RESULTS: Mean age was 76 ± 5 years, estimated GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 ± 14 
ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was 128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 ± 
0.011 EU/ml and was independent of renal function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial 
stiffness, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased 
with AHT (to 0.020 ± 0.028 EU/ml; P < 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = 
-0.38; P = 0.02), arterial wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 
0.01), and degree of tonic vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = 
-0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC, PWV, gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. 
Improvement of their CV status with optimized AHT is associated with a 
significant reduction in endotoxemia. Further investigation of the potential 
pathophysiological mechanisms linking CV disease and CKD with this previously 
unappreciated effect of AHT appears warranted.

Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of 
arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar 
pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of 
calcification of atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent 
calcification inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined 
functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between bone 
mineral densitometry parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum 
fetuin-A levels. In a cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance 
hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. 
Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in maintenance HD patients and healthy 
controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery 
calcification score (CACS) measured by electron-beam computed tomography. The 
associations between site-specific BMD parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A 
levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. CACS, mass, and volume of 
plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in patients with a 
T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, neck and 
trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration 
was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less than healthy 
controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in 
coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A levels. 
Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum 
fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and 
trochanter of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study 
demonstrates an association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery 
calcification, and bone mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in 
maintenance HD patients. However, the results should be interpreted with caution 
because of the cross-sectional design of the study.

INTRODUCTION: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated 
with an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and 
mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the 
frequency, the associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a 
cohort of prevalent HD patients.
METHODS: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the French ARNOS 
cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the 
Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, 
Group 1) and ≥ 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis 
was performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were 
excluded.
RESULTS: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of 
Group 2 (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum 
albumin levels (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake 
(nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 
0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with 
calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher 
mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, 
diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds ratios of mortality for patients with 
VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 
patients in Group 1 did not receive any PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium 
carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥ 
1.5 mmol/l (94%)).
CONCLUSION: In this observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of 
prevalent HD patients and was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate 
therapeutic strategy could be responsible for this observation. The real 
consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic bone disease remain hypothetical, but 
it may be related to the risk of developing vascular calcification. It is 
hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using fewer PTH-lowering therapies 
in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of 
vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between 
seasonal variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification.
METHODS: As a prospective observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We 
have assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer 
(September) and winter (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association 
of serum 25D level with vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the 
summer, when vitamin D levels were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral 
lumbar spine from all subjects were studied for calculation of semiquantitative 
VCS as described by Kauppila.
RESULTS: The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the summer and 
increased to 96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and diabetes were 
associated with vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate analysis, 25D 
levels were inversely related to vascular calcification. However, after 
correcting for confounding factors, this relationship lost statistical 
significance. Multivariate analysis showed that age, systolic blood pressure, 
and LDL-cholesterol levels were directly associated with a higher VCS.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in HD patients with marked 
seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be identified as an 
independent predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic 
kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal 
of the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are 
associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis 
patients.
METHODS: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 54 
haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular 
access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the 
abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes 
unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the 
graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, 
common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 
5-point scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to 
complete the anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed.
RESULTS: There was a high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular 
calcification (kappa = 0.801). Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic 
arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft 
failure. In contrast, three of six patients (50%) with moderate to severe 
calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's 
exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was lower in the group with 
grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two groups were similar in 
age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum calcium, serum 
phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone.
CONCLUSION: There is a strong association between pelvic artery calcifications 
and technical failure of thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe 
vascular calcification is predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.

BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular 
calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may 
promote vascular calcification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of inflammation on the 
relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 222 prevalent 
haemodialysis (HD) patients.
RESULTS: Serum fetuin correlated negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by 
Davies score) and circulating inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A 
levels (< median) had higher mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 
0.001), but this association was lost after adjustment for age, gender, 
comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and inflammation (CRP > median). In 
inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly independent association with 
mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed 
patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same variables. 
Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high fetuin-A 
did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with high 
fetuin-A.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are associated 
with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of inflammation. 
This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and low-grade 
inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD patients.

BACKGROUND: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration 
is inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been 
several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors 
(PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) 
Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is 
currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to 
affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population 
in whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels.
METHODS: Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent 
hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was 
determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week 
intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The 
relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted 
analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, 
diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration.
RESULTS: 55 % of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of 
patients (62 %) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) 
used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI 
users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted 
after stratifying for dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable 
adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level 
< 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was 
a non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower 
serum Mg levels (p = 0.067).
CONCLUSION: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared 
with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the magnitude 
of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of 
cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of 
digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with 
the severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We 
hypothesized that in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium 
(CAC) score have a gradient association that follows that of subjects without 
kidney disease. We examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group 
of long-term hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart. 
Area under the curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index 
of vascular function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia 
test. Coronary calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography 
or multidetector computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited 
hemodialysis patients (age: 58 ± 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and 
gender-matched controls. In hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was 
significantly worse (114 ± 72 vs. 143 ± 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was higher 
(525 ± 425 vs. 240 ± 332, P < 0.001). Hemodialysis patients were 14 times more 
likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared with controls. After adjustment for 
known confounders, the relative risk for case vs. control for each standard 
deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.93, P = 
0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM technology is 
incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in whom both 
measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The DTM 
technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify 
hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification often occurs in patients with uremia. As 
osteopontin (OPN) is not only involved in the physiological but also the 
pathological calcification of tissues, OPN may be associated with the 
pathogenesis of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: We examined the expression of OPN in atherosclerotic aortas of HD 
patients. In addition, we performed a prospective longitudinal study by using CT 
scans to detect aortic calcifications and by measuring the plasma OPN 
concentration by ELISA in HD patients (20 men, 16 women; mean age 55.2 +/- 21.3 
years) and in healthy volunteers (18 men, 17 women; mean age 54.0 +/- 13.2 
years).
RESULTS: By immunohistochemical staining, OPN was abundantly localized in 
atherosclerotic plaques of HD patients. The macrophages surrounding the 
atheromatous plaques were identified as the OPN-expressing cells. We furthermore 
found that the concentration of soluble plasma OPN was significantly higher in 
HD patients as compared with the concentrations in age-matched healthy 
volunteers (837.3 +/- 443.2 vs. 315.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml, p < 0.01). The OPN 
concentration was positively correlated with the aortic calcification index in 
HD patients (r = 0.749, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that OPN, secreted by macrophages, plays a role 
in the calcification of atheromatous plaques in HD patients.

Vascular calcium deposition in end-stage renal disease occurs commonly, but its 
relation to cardiovascular risk factors and fetuin-A levels in African Americans 
is not known. Compliant African American patients who were undergoing 
hemodialysis (HD; n = 17) agreed to undergo 64-slice multidetector computed 
tomography for the assessment of coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The 
relation between traditional cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age; gender; 
dialysis vintage; history of diabetes; means of the previous 3 years of weekly 
predialysis blood pressure values and hemoglobin levels; means of monthly values 
of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid; and albumin; and means 
of quarterly measurements of parathyroid hormone and lipids) and fetuin-A levels 
and CACS was explored using univariate analyses. Serum phosphorus levels over 
the previous 3 years were well controlled. The CACS range was 0 to 3,877 
Agatston units (mean 996, median 196). Among the tested variables, only fetuin-A 
was significantly and inversely associated with CACS (standardized beta = -0.64, 
95% confidence interval -18.09 to -3.62, p = 0.006). There was no association 
between age and fetuin-A level (standardized beta = -0.02, 95% confidence 
interval -0.10 to 0.23). In conclusion, African-American patients who were 
undergoing long-term hemodialysis and with good phosphorus control exhibited a 
strong inverse correlation between fetuin-A level and CACS that was independent 
of age.
