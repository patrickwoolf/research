AB  - Children on dialysis have a cardiovascular mortality risk equivalent to older adults 
      in the general population, and rapidly develop medial vascular calcification, an 
      age-associated pathology. We hypothesized that premature vascular ageing contributes 
      to calcification in children with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vessels 
      from children with Stage 5 CKD with and without dialysis had evidence of increased 
      oxidative DNA damage. The senescence markers p16 and p21 were also increased in 
      vessels from children on dialysis. Treatment of vessel rings ex vivo with calcifying 
      media increased oxidative DNA damage in vessels from children with Stage 5 CKD, but 
      not in those from healthy controls. Vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from 
      children on dialysis exhibited persistent DNA damage, impaired DNA damage repair, 
      and accelerated senescence. Under calcifying conditions vascular smooth muscle cells 
      from children on dialysis showed increased osteogenic differentiation and 
      calcification. These changes correlated with activation of the senescence-associated 
      secretory phenotype (SASP), an inflammatory phenotype characterized by the secretion 
      of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Blockade of ataxia-telangiectasia 
      mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage signaling reduced both inflammation and 
      calcification. Clinically, children on dialysis had elevated circulating levels of 
      osteogenic SASP factors that correlated with increased vascular stiffness and 
      coronary artery calcification. These data imply that dysregulated mineral metabolism 
      drives vascular "inflammaging" by promoting oxidative DNA damage, premature 
      senescence, and activation of a pro-inflammatory SASP. Drugs that target DNA damage 
      signaling or eliminate senescent cells may have the potential to prevent vascular 
      calcification in patients with advanced CKD.

LID - 10.1159/000493549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous (AV) access dysfunction is a common complication in 
      hemodialysis patients. Markers of vascular calcification are associated with 
      cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in this population, but their association with 
      vascular access outcomes is unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
      association between selected vascular calcification makers and vascular access 
      complications in a cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHOD: Fetuin-A, osteopontin 
      (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) were measured 
      in blood samples from 219 dialysis patients in the Choice for Healthy Outcomes in 
      Caring for end-stage renal disease study; these patients were using a permanent 
      vascular access. Participants were followed for up to 1 year or until the occurrence 
      of a vascular access intervention or replacement. Associations with AV fistula (AVF) 
      and AV graft (AVG) intervention-free survival were assessed in models adjusted for 
      demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and inflammation. RESULTS: A total of 24 
      out 103 participants with an AVF and 43 out of 116 participants with an AVG had an 
      intervention during follow-up. Lower fetuin-A, higher OPN, and higher BMP-7 were 
      associated with a higher risk of AVF intervention (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] for 
      highest versus lowest tertile = 0.30 [95% CI 0.10-0.94]) for fetuin-A, 3.84 (95% CI 
      1.16-12.74) for OPN, and 3.49 (95% CI 1.16-10.52) for BMP-7. OPG was not 
      significantly associated with the risk of AVF intervention. The associations of OPN 
      and BMP-7 with AVF intervention appeared stronger among participants without 
      diabetes (aHR 8.06; 95% CI 1.11-58.57 for OPN and aHR 2.55; 95% CI 1.08-6.08 for 
      BMP-7, respectively) than among their counterparts with diabetes (p interaction = 
      0.06). None of the markers studied were significantly associated with AVG 
      interventions. CONCLUSION: Lower fetuin-A and higher OPN and BMP-7 are associated 
      with complications in AVF but not in AVG, suggesting a role for calcification in the 
      pathogenesis AVF failure.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among 
      Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.0363 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in 
      dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are sparse 
      data on the association of CAC with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease and 
      all-cause mortality in this population. OBJECTIVE: To study the prospective 
      association of CAC with risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among 
      dialysis-naive patients with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective 
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study recruited adults with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 7 clinical centers in the 
      United States. There were 1541 participants without cardiovascular disease at 
      baseline who had CAC scores. EXPOSURES: Coronary artery calcification was assessed 
      using electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incidence of cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction, 
      heart failure, and stroke) and all-cause mortality were reported every 6 months and 
      confirmed by medical record adjudication. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 
      5.9 years in 1541 participants aged 21 to 74 years, there were 188 cardiovascular 
      disease events (60 cases of myocardial infarction, 120 heart failures, and 27 
      strokes; patients may have had >1 event) and 137 all-cause deaths. In Cox 
      proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, education 
      level, physical activity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive treatment, 
      current cigarette smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, C-reactive protein 
      level, hemoglobin A1c level, phosphorus level, troponin T level, log N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, fibroblast growth factor 23 level, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, the hazard ratios associated with per 1 
      SD log of CAC were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.69; P < .001) for cardiovascular disease, 
      1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-2.02; P = .04) for myocardial infarction, 1.39 (95% CI, 
      1.10-1.76; P = .006) for heart failure, and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94-1.51; P = .15) for 
      all-cause mortality. In addition, inclusion of CAC score led to an increase in the C 
      statistic of 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.09; P < .001) for predicting cardiovascular disease 
      over use of all the above-mentioned established and novel cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Coronary artery calcification is 
      independently and significantly related to the risks of cardiovascular disease, 
      myocardial infarction, and heart failure in patients with CKD. In addition, CAC 
      improves risk prediction for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and 
      heart failure over use of established and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors 
      among patients with CKD; however, the changes in the C statistic are small.

TI  - Effects of phosphate binders in moderate CKD.
PG  - 1407-15
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2012030223 [doi]
AB  - Some propose using phosphate binders in the CKD population given the association 
      between higher levels of phosphorus and mortality, but their safety and efficacy in 
      this population are not well understood. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of 
      phosphate binders on parameters of mineral metabolism and vascular calcification 
      among patients with moderate to advanced CKD. We randomly assigned 148 patients with 
      estimated GFR=20-45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to calcium acetate, lanthanum carbonate, 
      sevelamer carbonate, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in mean serum 
      phosphorus from baseline to the average of months 3, 6, and 9. Serum phosphorus 
      decreased from a baseline mean of 4.2 mg/dl in both active and placebo arms to 3.9 
      mg/dl with active therapy and 4.1 mg/dl with placebo (P=0.03). Phosphate binders, 
      but not placebo, decreased mean 24-hour urine phosphorus by 22%. Median serum intact 
      parathyroid hormone remained stable with active therapy and increased with placebo 
      (P=0.002). Active therapy did not significantly affect plasma C-terminal fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 levels. Active therapy did, however, significantly increase 
      calcification of the coronary arteries and abdominal aorta (coronary: median 
      increases of 18.1% versus 0.6%, P=0.05; abdominal aorta: median increases of 15.4% 
      versus 3.4%, P=0.03). In conclusion, phosphate binders significantly lower serum and 
      urinary phosphorus and attenuate progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism among 
      patients with CKD who have normal or near-normal levels of serum phosphorus; 
      however, they also promote the progression of vascular calcification. The safety and 
      efficacy of phosphate binders in CKD remain uncertain.

TI  - Malnutrition, inflammation, progression of vascular calcification and survival: 
      Inter-relationships in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - e0216415

LID - e0216415
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Malnutrition and inflammation are closely linked to vascular 
      calcification (VC), the severity of which correlate with adverse outcome. However, 
      there were few studies on the interplay between malnutrition, inflammation and VC 
      progression, rather than VC presence per se. We aimed to determine the relationship 
      of malnutrition, inflammation, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) progression with 
      survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Malnutrition and inflammation were 
      defined as low serum albumin (< 40 g/L) and high hs-CRP (≥ 28.57 nmol/L), 
      respectively. We defined AAC progression as an increase in AAC score using lateral 
      lumbar radiography at both baseline and one year later. Patients were followed up to 
      investigate the impact of AAC progression on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
      RESULTS: AAC progressed in 54.6% of 97 patients (mean age 58.2±11.7 years, 41.2% 
      men) at 1-year follow-up. Hypoalbuminemia (Odds ratio 3.296; 95% confidence interval 
      1.178-9.222), hs-CRP (1.561; 1.038-2.348), low LDL-cholesterol (0.976; 0.955-0.996), 
      and the presence of baseline AAC (10.136; 3.173-32.386) were significant risk 
      factors for AAC progression. During the mean follow-up period of 5.9 years, 
      38(39.2%) patients died and 27(71.0%) of them died of cardiovascular disease. 
      Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for old age, diabetes, cardiovascular 
      history, and hypoalbuminemia determined that AAC progression was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause mortality (2.294; 1.054-4.994). CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition and 
      inflammation were significantly associated with AAC progression. AAC progression is 
      more informative than AAC presence at a given time-point as a predictor of all-cause 
      mortality in patients on maintenance HD.

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 on progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in 
      nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5.
PG  - 631-40
LID - AOP_15_066 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of vitamin 
      K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and vascular 
      calcification. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of vitamin K2 substitution on the 
      progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD 
      stages 3-5. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 42 nondialyzed patients with 
      CKD. The following measurements were taken at baseline and after 270 ±12 days of 
      supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose of 90 μg (menaquinone, MK-7) together with 
      10 μg of cholecalciferol (K+D group) or 10 μg of cholecalciferol (group D): common 
      carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS), basic biochemical parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix 
      Gla protein (MGP), desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), fetuin A, osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23. RESULTS: The 
      increase of CCA-IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D 
      group: from 0.95 ±0.2 mm to 1.01 ±0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 ±0.2 mm to 1.16 ±0.3, 
      P = 0.003 (ΔCCA-IMT, 0.06 ±0.08 vs 0.136 ±0.05 mm, P = 0.005, respectively). The 
      increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in the D group (ΔCACS, 
      58.1 ±106.5 AU vs 74.4 ±127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the K+D group, a significant decrease 
      in the level of dp-ucMGP and total OC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 270-day course of 
      vitamin K2 administration in patients with CKD stages 3-5 may reduce the progression 
      of atherosclerosis, but does not significantly affect the progression of 
      calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly changes the levels of calcification 
      promoters and inhibitors: dp-ucMGP, OC, and OPG.

TI  - Slowing Progression of Cardiovascular Calcification With SNF472 in Patients on 
      Hemodialysis: Results of a Randomized Phase 2b Study.
PG  - 728-739
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease could be partially caused by extensive cardiovascular 
      calcification. SNF472, intravenous myo-inositol hexaphosphate, selectively inhibits 
      the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite. METHODS: This double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled phase 2b trial compared progression of coronary artery calcium 
      volume score and other measurements of cardiovascular calcification by computed 
      tomography scan during 52 weeks of treatment with SNF472 or placebo, in addition to 
      standard therapy, in adult patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving 
      hemodialysis. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to SNF472 300 mg (n=92), SNF472 600 mg 
      (n=91), or placebo (n=91) by infusion in the hemodialysis lines thrice weekly during 
      hemodialysis sessions. The primary end point was change in log coronary artery 
      calcium volume score from baseline to week 52. The primary efficacy analysis 
      combined the SNF472 treatment groups and included all patients who received at least 
      1 dose of SNF472 or placebo and had an evaluable computed tomography scan after 
      randomization. RESULTS: The mean change in coronary artery calcium volume score was 
      11% (95% CI, 7-15) for the combined SNF472 dose group and 20% (95% CI, 14-26) for 
      the placebo group (P=0.016). SNF472 compared with placebo attenuated progression of 
      calcium volume score in the aortic valve (14% [95% CI, 5-24] versus 98% [95% CI, 
      77-123]; P<0.001) but not in the thoracic aorta (23% [95% CI, 16-30] versus 28% [95% 
      CI, 19-38]; P=0.40). Death occurred in 7 patients (4%) who received SNF472 and 5 
      patients (6%) who received placebo. At least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
      occurred in 86%, 92%, and 87% of patients treated with SNF472 300 mg, SNF472 600 mg, 
      and placebo, respectively. Most adverse events were mild. Adverse events resulted in 
      discontinuation of SNF472 300 mg, SNF472 600 mg, and placebo for 14%, 29%, and 20% 
      of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, SNF472 significantly 
      attenuated the progression of coronary artery calcium and aortic valve calcification 
      in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis in addition to 
      standard care. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of SNF472 on 
      cardiovascular events. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique

PG  - 369-377
LID - 10.1159/000494665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is seen in most patients on dialysis and is 
      strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Vascular calcification is 
      promoted by phosphate, which generally reaches higher levels in hemodialysis than in 
      peritoneal dialysis. However, whether vascular calcification develops less in 
      peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis is currently unknown. Therefore, we 
      compared coronary artery calcification (CAC), its progression, and calcification 
      biomarkers between patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. METHODS: We 
      measured CAC in 134 patients who had been treated exclusively with hemodialysis (n = 
      94) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 40) and were transplantation candidates. In 57 of 
      them (34 on hemodialysis and 23 on peritoneal dialysis), we also measured CAC 
      progression annually up to 3 years and the inactive species of 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin. 
      We compared CAC cross-sectionally with Tobit regression. CAC progression was 
      compared in 2 ways: with linear mixed models as the difference in square root 
      transformed volume score per year (ΔCAC SQRV) and with Tobit mixed models. We 
      adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional cohort, CAC 
      volume scores were 92 mm3 in hemodialysis and 492 mm3 in peritoneal dialysis 
      (adjusted difference 436 mm3; 95% CI -47 to 919; p = 0.08). In the longitudinal 
      cohort, peritoneal dialysis was associated with significantly more CAC progression 
      defined as ΔCAC SQRV (adjusted difference 1.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31; p = 0.03), but 
      not with Tobit mixed models (adjusted difference in CAC score increase per year 106 
      mm3; 95% CI -140 to 352; p = 0.40). Peritoneal dialysis was associated with higher 
      osteoprotegerin (adjusted p = 0.02) but not with dp-ucMGP or fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Peritoneal dialysis is not associated with less CAC or CAC progression than 
      hemodialysis, and perhaps with even more progression. This indicates that vascular 
      calcification does not develop less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis.

LID - 10.1681/ASN.2018111150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing strategies for managing coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      in patients with CKD is an important clinical challenge. Experimental studies have 
      demonstrated that magnesium inhibits vascular calcification, whereas the uremic 
      toxin indoxyl sulfate aggravates it. METHODS: To assess the efficacy of magnesium 
      oxide (MgO) and/or the oral carbon adsorbent AST-120 for slowing CAC progression in 
      CKD, we conducted a 2-year, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, enrolling 
      patients with stage 3-4 CKD with risk factors for CAC (diabetes mellitus, history of 
      cardiovascular disease, high LDL cholesterol, or smoking). Using a two-by-two 
      factorial design, we randomly assigned patients to an MgO group or a control group, 
      and to an AST-120 group or a control group. The primary outcome was percentage 
      change in CAC score. RESULTS: We terminated the study prematurely after an interim 
      analysis with the first 125 enrolled patients (of whom 96 completed the study) 
      showed that the median change in CAC score was significantly smaller for MgO versus 
      control (11.3% versus 39.5%). The proportion of patients with an annualized 
      percentage change in CAC score of ≥15% was also significantly lower for MgO compared 
      with control (23.9% versus 62.0%). However, MgO did not suppress the progression of 
      thoracic aorta calcification. The MgO group's dropout rate was higher than that of 
      the control group (27% versus 17%), primarily due to diarrhea. The percentage change 
      in CAC score did not differ significantly between the AST-120 and control groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MgO, but not AST-120, appears to be effective in slowing CAC 
      progression. Larger-scale trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Vitamin K Supplementation to Improve Vascular Stiffness in CKD: The K4Kidneys 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2434-2445
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2020020225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is 
      common among patients with CKD and is an independent contributor to increased 
      vascular stiffness and vascular risk in this patient group. Vitamin K is a cofactor 
      for proteins involved in prevention of vascular calcification. Whether or not 
      vitamin K supplementation could improve arterial stiffness in patients with CKD is 
      unknown. METHODS: To determine if vitamin K supplementation might improve arterial 
      stiffness in patients in CKD, we conducted a parallel-group, double-blind, 
      randomized trial in participants aged 18 or older with CKD stage 3b or 4 (eGFR 15-45 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). We randomly assigned participants to receive 400 μg oral 
      vitamin K2 or matching placebo once daily for a year. The primary outcome was the 
      adjusted between-group difference in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity at 12 
      months. Secondary outcomes included augmentation index, abdominal aortic 
      calcification, BP, physical function, and blood markers of mineral metabolism and 
      vascular health. We also updated a recently published meta-analysis of trials to 
      include the findings of this study. RESULTS: We included 159 randomized participants 
      in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, with 80 allocated to receive vitamin K 
      and 79 to receive placebo. Mean age was 66 years, 62 (39%) were female, and 87 (55%) 
      had CKD stage 4. We found no differences in pulse wave velocity at 12 months, 
      augmentation index at 12 months, BP, B-type natriuretic peptide, or physical 
      function. The updated meta-analysis showed no effect of vitamin K supplementation on 
      vascular stiffness or vascular calcification measures. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K2 
      supplementation did not improve vascular stiffness or other measures of vascular 
      health in this trial involving individuals with CKD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME 
      AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: Vitamin K therapy to improve vascular health in patients

TI  - Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Vitamin K Antagonist Replacement by 
      Rivaroxaban with or without Vitamin K2 in Hemodialysis Patients with Atrial 
      Fibrillation: the Valkyrie Study.
PG  - 186-196
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2019060579 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), although commonly used to reduce 
      thromboembolic risk in atrial fibrillation, have been incriminated as probable cause 
      of accelerated vascular calcification (VC) in patients on hemodialysis. Functional 
      vitamin K deficiency may further contribute to their susceptibility for VC. We 
      investigated the effect of vitamin K status on VC progression in 132 patients on 
      hemodialysis with atrial fibrillation treated with VKAs or qualifying for 
      anticoagulation. METHODS: Patients were randomized to VKAs with target INR 2-3, 
      rivaroxaban 10 mg daily, or rivaroxaban 10 mg daily plus vitamin K2 2000 µg thrice 
      weekly during 18 months. Systemic dp-ucMGP levels were quantified to assess vascular 
      vitamin K status. Cardiac and thoracic aorta calcium scores and pulse wave velocity 
      were measured to evaluate VC progression. RESULTS: Baseline dp-ucMGP was severely 
      elevated in all groups. Initiation or continuation of VKAs further increased 
      dp-ucMGP, whereas levels decreased in the rivaroxaban group and to a larger extent 
      in the rivaroxaban+vitamin K2 group, but remained nevertheless elevated. Changes in 
      coronary artery, thoracic aorta, and cardiac valve calcium scores and pulse wave 
      velocity were not significantly different among the treatment arms. All cause death, 
      stroke, and cardiovascular event rates were similar between the groups. Bleeding 
      outcomes were not significantly different, except for a lower number of 
      life-threatening and major bleeding episodes in the rivaroxaban arms versus the VKA 
      arm. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of VKAs and high-dose vitamin K2 improve vitamin K 
      status in patients on hemodialysis, but have no significant favorable effect on VC 
      progression. Severe bleeding complications may be lower with rivaroxaban than with 
      VKAs.

TI  - Serum phosphate levels and mortality risk among people with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 520-8
AB  - Elevated serum phosphate levels have been linked with vascular calcification and 
      mortality among dialysis patients. The relationship between phosphate and mortality 
      has not been explored among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted from eight Veterans Affairs' Medical 
      Centers located in the Pacific Northwest. CKD was defined by two continuously 
      abnormal outpatient serum creatinine measurements at least 6 mo apart between 1999 
      and 2002. Patients who received chronic dialysis, those with a present or previous 
      renal transplant, and those without a recent phosphate measurement were excluded. 
      The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points were acute 
      myocardial infarction and the combined end point of myocardial infarction plus 
      death. A total of 95,619 veterans with at least one primary care or internal 
      medicine clinic contact from a Northwest VA facility and two or more outpatient 
      measurements of serum creatinine, at least 6 mo apart, between January 1, 1999, and 
      December 31, 2002, were identified. From this eligible population, 7021 patients met 
      our definition of CKD. After exclusions, 6730 CKD patients were available for 
      analysis, and 3490 had a serum phosphate measurement during the previous 18 mo. 
      After adjustment, serum phosphate levels >3.5 mg/dl were associated with a 
      significantly increased risk for death. Mortality risk increased linearly with each 
      subsequent 0.5-mg/dl increase in serum phosphate levels. Elevated serum phosphate 
      levels were independently associated with increased mortality risk among this 
      population of patients with CKD.

TI  - Online Hemodiafiltration Inhibits Inflammation-Related Endothelial Dysfunction and 
      Vascular Calcification of Uremic Patients Modulating miR-223 Expression in Plasma 
      Extracellular Vesicles.
PG  - 2372-2383
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1800747 [doi]
AB  - Decreased inflammation and cardiovascular mortality are evident in patients with 
      end-stage chronic kidney disease treated by online hemodiafiltration. Extracellular 
      vesicles (EV) are mediators of cell-to-cell communication and contain different RNA 
      types. This study investigated whether mixed online hemodiafiltration (mOL-HDF) 
      beneficial effects associate with changes in the RNA content of plasma EV in chronic 
      kidney disease patients. Thirty bicarbonate hemodialysis (BHD) patients were 
      randomized 1:1 to continue BHD or switch to mOL-HDF. Concentration, size, and 
      microRNA content of plasma EV were evaluated for 9 mo; we then studied EV effects on 
      inflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis of endothelial cells (HUVEC) and on 
      osteoblast mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). mOL-HDF treatment 
      reduced different inflammatory markers, including circulating CRP, IL-6, and NGAL. 
      All hemodialysis patients showed higher plasma levels of endothelial-derived EV than 
      healthy subjects, with no significant differences between BHD and mOL-HDF. However, 
      BHD-derived EV had an increased expression of the proatherogenic miR-223 with 
      respect to healthy subjects or mOL-HDF. Compared with EV from healthy subjects, 
      those from hemodialysis patients reduced angiogenesis and increased HUVEC apoptosis 
      and VSMC calcification; however, all these detrimental effects were reduced with 
      mOL-HDF with respect to BHD. Cell transfection with miR-223 mimic or antagomiR 
      proved the role of this microRNA in EV-induced HUVEC and VSMC dysfunction. The 
      switch from BHD to mOL-HDF significantly reduced systemic inflammation and miR-223 
      expression in plasma EV, thus improving HUVEC angiogenesis and reducing VSMC 
      calcification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic dialysis patients and is 
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the role of circulating 
      microRNAs (miRs) in vascular calcification has rarely been investigated. We aimed to 
      determine circulating levels of miRs in hemodialysis patients, and analyzed their 
      relationship with vascular calcification. METHODS: Sixty-one stable hemodialysis 
      patients were enrolled, including 31 with vascular calcification and 30 without. 
      Demographic and biochemical data were collected and reviewed. The presence and 
      severity of vascular calcification were determined by lumber spine X-ray. Blood 
      levels of miR29a/b, miR223, miR9, and miR21 were determined. RESULTS: Patients with 
      vascular calcification were older (65.6 ± 9.0 vs. 59.1 ± 7.1 years) with a higher 
      proportion of vascular disease (55% vs. 23%) than those without vascular 
      calcification. Additionally, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (3.90 vs 2.09 
      mg/dL) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (17311 vs. 6306 pg/mL) were significantly 
      higher. Patients with vascular calcification also had higher levels of miR29a/b and 
      miR223. Regression analysis indicated that age and miR29a were significant 
      associates of the calcification score. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients with 
      vascular calcification had higher levels of miR 29a/b and miR223 than those without 
      vascular calcification, and circulating miR29a was associated with calcification 
      severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of preexisting 
      calcification in the inflow artery on maturation and flow volume of an arteriovenous 
      fistula (AVF). METHODS: Patients who underwent AVF creation for hemodialysis were 
      prospectively recruited between March and November 2017. On preoperative duplex 
      ultrasound, calcification in the arterial media within 5 cm of the planned 
      anastomosis area was assessed. Clinical maturation was defined as the successful use 
      of the fistula for ≥75% of the dialysis sessions during a month within 6 months 
      after surgery. Radiological maturation was defined as a venous diameter of ≥0.4 cm 
      and a flow volume of ≥500 mL/min. Flow volumes of the inflow artery and the cephalic 
      vein were measured at 6 and 12 weeks after AVF creation. RESULTS: Eighteen patients 
      with calcification and 29 patients without calcification were enrolled in this 
      study. There was no significant difference in the clinical and radiological 
      maturation between the groups. The flow volume of the inflow artery, measured at 
      6 weeks postoperatively, was significantly higher in the noncalcification group than 
      in the calcification group (P = 0.042). The flow volume of the inflow artery in the 
      noncalcification group was increased at 12 weeks postoperatively (P = 0.091). Flow 
      volume of the vein was higher in the noncalcification group than in the 
      calcification group, although it did not reach statistical significance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In conclusions, preexisting arterial calcification did not adversely 
      affect the AVF maturation. However, arterial calcification correlated with the flow 
      volume of the inflow artery of AVF.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
      kidney function and arterial calcification in major vascular beds and to establish 
      whether arterial calcification mediates the relation between kidney function 
      measures and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence. Methods and Results In 2241 
      participants from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69 years, 52% female), kidney 
      function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio. All participants underwent noncontrast computed 
      tomography to quantify the amount of arterial calcification in the coronary 
      arteries, aortic arch, extracranial, and intracranial internal carotid arteries. We 
      used linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors, to evaluate the association between kidney function and arterial 
      calcification volume in the 4 vessel beds. Incidence rate of CVD was calculated in 3 
      groups of participants based on their kidney function and presence of arterial 
      calcification. We conducted mediation analysis to evaluate whether arterial 
      calcification mediates this association. We found that in age- and sex-adjusted 
      models, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin-to-creatinine 
      ratio were associated with larger calcification volumes in all 4 vascular beds. 
      Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the effect estimates. CVD 
      incidence was higher in participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and presence of arterial calcification compared with 
      individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 and no calcification. 
      After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, arterial calcification did not 
      mediate the association between kidney function measures and CVD incidence. 
      Conclusions The association of impaired kidney function and larger volumes of 
      arterial calcification is partly explained by cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial 
      calcification does not mediate the association between kidney function and CVD 
      beyond cardiovascular risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between 
      aortic calcification and demographic and biochemical parameters in hemodialysis 
      patients. SUMMARY: Calcification scores of the aortic arch and abdominal aorta were 
      determined from multi-slice computed tomography scans and evaluated according to the 
      Agatston score. The associations between demographic and biochemical parameters and 
      aortic calcification score were determined. In total, 190 patients were included in 
      the study. There was a significant positive correlation between aortic calcification 
      scores and age, duration of hemodialysis, cardiothoracic ratio, normalized protein 
      catabolic rate, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), serum markers of mineral 
      metabolism, and inflammation. A significant negative correlation was found between 
      aortic calcification scores and platelet count. Multivariate analysis showed that 
      age, duration of hemodialysis, baPWV, phosphate, calcium and phosphate (Ca×P) 
      product, parathyroid hormone, and C-reactive protein levels were independent risk 
      factors for calcification of the aortic arch, while baPWV and Ca×P product were 
      independent risk factors for calcification of the abdominal aorta. Key Messages: 
      Aortic calcification scores correlate with age, duration of hemodialysis, and 
      several biochemical parameters of inflammation and mineral metabolism.

TI  - Examining the effects of uric acid-lowering on markers vascular of calcification and 
      CKD-MBD; A post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - e0205831
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0205831 [doi]
LID - e0205831
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a 
      systemic disorder that leads to vascular calcification and accelerated 
      atherosclerosis. Uric acid has been shown to associate with vascular calcification 
      and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to suppress the 1 α-hydroxylase 
      enzyme leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and higher intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid 
      would reduce CIMT, calcification propensity, and circulating markers of CKD-MBD in 
      CKD. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind study of 80 
      patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia who received allopurinol or placebo for 
      12 weeks. CIMT and T50 were measured as markers of vascular disease and serum 
      calcification propensity, respectively. The following markers of CKD-MBD were 
      measured: serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, and fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Expression of extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase was evaluated in 
      endothelial cells of study participants. FINDINGS: Allopurinol successfully lowered 
      serum uric acid levels compared to placebo with an estimate of -3.3 mg/dL (95% C.I. 
      -4.1,-2.5; p < 0.0001). After 12 weeks, however, we found no significant change in 
      CIMT or serum T50. There was not a significant change in vitamin D metabolites, 
      iPTH, FGF-23, or the expression of endothelial 1α-hydroxylase. CONCLUSION: These 
      data suggest that factors other than uric acid may play a more important role in the 
      regulation of CKD- MBD including vascular calcification and vitamin D metabolism in 
      patients with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF23), arterial calcification, and cardiovascular mortality. Effects of 
      phosphate-lowering medication on vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in 
      CKD remain uncertain. METHODS: To assess the effects of non-calcium-based phosphate 
      binders on intermediate cardiovascular markers, we conducted a multicenter, 
      double-blind trial, randomizing 278 participants with stage 3b or 4 CKD and serum 
      phosphate >1.00 mmol/L (3.10 mg/dl) to 500 mg lanthanum carbonate or matched placebo 
      thrice daily for 96 weeks. We analyzed the primary outcome, carotid-femoral pulse 
      wave velocity, using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures. Secondary 
      outcomes included abdominal aortic calcification and serum and urine markers of 
      mineral metabolism. RESULTS: A total of 138 participants received lanthanum and 140 
      received placebo (mean age 63.1 years; 69% male, 64% White). Mean eGFR was 26.6 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2); 45% of participants had diabetes and 32% had cardiovascular 
      disease. Mean serum phosphate was 1.25 mmol/L (3.87 mg/dl), mean pulse wave velocity 
      was 10.8 m/s, and 81.3% had abdominal aortic calcification at baseline. At 96 weeks, 
      pulse wave velocity did not differ significantly between groups, nor did abdominal 
      aortic calcification, serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone, FGF23, and 24-hour 
      urinary phosphate. Serious adverse events occurred in 63 (46%) participants 
      prescribed lanthanum and 66 (47%) prescribed placebo. Although recruitment to target 
      was not achieved, additional analysis suggested this was unlikely to have 
      significantly affected the principle findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage 
      3b/4 CKD, treatment with lanthanum over 96 weeks did not affect arterial stiffness 
      or aortic calcification compared with placebo. These findings do not support the 
      role of intestinal phosphate binders to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with 
      CKD who have normophosphatemia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on functional vitamin K deficiency in 
      hemodialysis patients: a randomized trial.
PG  - 186-95
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.10.041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. Hemodialysis patients experience severe vascular calcifications. Matrix 
      Gla protein (MGP) is a central calcification inhibitor of the arterial wall; its 
      activity depends on vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamate carboxylation. Uncarboxylated 
      MGP, formed as a result of vitamin K deficiency, is associated with cardiovascular 
      disease. Recent studies suggest poor vitamin K status in hemodialysis patients. We 
      therefore aimed to investigate whether daily vitamin K supplementation improves the 
      bioactivity of vitamin K-dependent proteins in hemodialysis patients, assessed by 
      circulating dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP, uncarboxylated osteocalcin, and 
      uncarboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II [protein induced by vitamin K absence II]). 
      STUDY DESIGN: Interventional randomized non-placebo-controlled trial with 3 parallel 
      groups. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 53 long-term hemodialysis patients in stable 
      conditions, 18 years or older. 50 healthy age-matched individuals served as 
      controls. INTERVENTIONS: Menaquinone-7 (vitamin K(2)) treatment at 45, 135, or 360 
      μg/d for 6 weeks. OUTCOMES: Plasma levels of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP, 
      uncarboxylated osteocalcin, and PIVKA-II. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels were assessed 
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: At baseline, hemodialysis 
      patients had 4.5-fold higher dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP and 8.4-fold higher 
      uncarboxylated osteocalcin levels compared with controls. PIVKA-II levels were 
      elevated in 49 hemodialysis patients. Vitamin K(2) supplementation induced a dose- 
      and time-dependent decrease in circulating dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP, 
      uncarboxylated osteocalcin, and PIVKA-II levels. Response rates in the reduction in 
      dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP levels were 77% and 93% in the groups receiving 
      135 μg and 360 μg of menaquinone-7, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that most hemodialysis patients have a functional 
      vitamin K deficiency. More importantly, it is the first study showing that inactive 
      MGP levels can be decreased markedly by daily vitamin K(2) supplementation. Our 
      study provides the rationale for intervention trials aimed at decreasing vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients by vitamin K supplementation.

TI  - Is arterial calcification in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease a 
      rare finding?
PG  - 696-702
LID - 10.1111/nep.13480 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate if calcification and intimal media thickness (IMT) of arteries 
      are present in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease and to describe 
      the risk factors associated with these alterations. METHODS: In an observational, 
      cross-sectional prospective study, 68 patients were evaluated at the time of renal 
      transplantation. A fragment of the inferior epigastric artery was removed during 
      surgery for histopathological analysis to verify the presence or not of arterial 
      calcification. Two outcomes were considered: the presence of calcium deposition and 
      the measurement of the IMT of the artery. The potential exposure variables were: 
      age, chronic kidney disease aetiology, diagnosis time, systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP), use of oral active vitamin D, homocysteine and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: 
      No arterial calcification was observed in the studied sample. The median value of 
      the IMT of the inferior epigastric artery was 166 μm (interquartile 
      range = 130-208). SBP standard deviation score and age were the only factors 
      associated with this outcome. There was no statistical interaction between SBP and 
      age with the IMT (P = 0.280). CONCLUSION: Arterial calcification is rare in children 
      and adolescents with end-stage renal disease. The factors associated with IMT were 
      age and SBP.

PG  - 1562-1571
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04710419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with CKD are at high risk for cardiovascular 
      disease, ESKD, and mortality. Vascular calcification is one pathway through which 
      cardiovascular disease risks are increased. We hypothesized that a novel measure of 
      serum calcification propensity is associated with cardiovascular disease events, 
      ESKD, and all-cause mortality among patients with CKD stages 2-4. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Among 3404 participants from the prospective, 
      longitudinal Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, we quantified calcification 
      propensity as the transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein 
      particles, with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. We 
      used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the 
      associations of T(50) with risks of adjudicated atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
      disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), 
      adjudicated heart failure, ESKD, and mortality. RESULTS: The mean T(50) was 313 (SD 
      79) minutes. Over an average 7.1 (SD 3.1) years of follow-up, we observed 571 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, 633 heart failure events, 887 ESKD 
      events, and 924 deaths. With adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk 
      factors, lower T(50) was significantly associated with higher risk of 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR] per SD lower T(50), 1.14; 
      95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.25), ESKD within 3 years from baseline 
      (HR per SD lower T(50), 1.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 1.86), and all-cause mortality (HR per 
      SD lower T(50), 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.24), but not heart failure (HR per SD lower 
      T(50), 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.15). After adjustment for eGFR and 24-hour urinary 
      protein, T(50) was not associated with risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
      disease, ESKD, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2-4, 
      higher serum calcification propensity is associated with atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease events, ESKD, and all-cause mortality, but this association 
      was not independent of kidney function. PODCAST: This article contains a podcast at

AB  - BACKGROUND Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of risk factors for dementia and 
      cognitive decline. Cardiovascular and dialysis-related factors might also be 
      involved in the mechanism of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors 
      including intracranial artery calcification and dialysis-related factors such as 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) might be associated with cognitive impairment in 
      hemodialysis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study 
      included patients receiving in-center hemodialysis over 6 months at our hospital. 
      All patients underwent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) examinations. Internal 
      carotid artery (ICA) calcium scores were measured using the Agatston method. The 
      Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was used for measurement of 
      cognitive function at each study visit. Serum concentrations of FGF23, 
      osteoprotegerin, and klotho were analyzed using commercial enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS This study included 69 patients. Cognitive 
      impairment was observed in 22 patients (31.9%), including 3 patients with dementia. 
      ICA calcium score in patients with cognitive impairment was higher than that in 
      those without cognitive impairment (177.3 versus 87.6, P=0.022). Intracranial artery 
      calcification was significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting 
      for FGF23 and 25-OH vitamin D, but not significant after adjusting for age, FGF23, 
      and 25-OH vitamin D. Low level of FGF23 was associated with cognitive impairment. 
      CONCLUSIONS Intracranial artery calcification and low FGF23 could be associated with 
      cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients. Longitudinal studies are needed to 
      investigate whether intracranial artery calcification and FGF23 could affect 
      cognitive function of hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Serum klotho: a potential predictor of cerebrovascular disease in hemodialysis 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients suffer from a serious threat of cerebrovascular 
      disease. Klotho, as an aging-suppressor gene, contributes to protect on vascular 
      calcification and oxidative stress, which are the risk factors of cerebrovascular 
      disease. The purpose of the present study is to determine the relationship between 
      serum klotho and cerebrovascular disease in patients receiving hemodialysis. 
      METHODS: Serum klotho levels of hemodialysis patients were measured by ELISA. 
      Cerebrovascular diseases were diagnosed by CT or MRI scans. The cognitive function 
      of hemodialysis patients with cerebrovascular disease were evaluated with a 
      neuropsychological battery assessing domains of global cognition verbal memory, 
      spatial memory, executive function and verbal fluency. RESULTS: Eighty-eight 
      patients were included, 57 ± 14 years, 63.64% male, 52.27% older than 60 years. 
      Twenty-eight participants had cerebrovascular disease (23 cases had cerebral 
      infarction, 5 cases had cerebral hemorrhage). The average level of serum klotho of 
      all participants was 119.10 ± 47.29 pg/ml. The serum klotho level was significantly 
      associated with cerebrovascular disease in hemodialysis patients 
      (HR(95%CI) = 0.975(0.960-0.990), p = 0.001). The optimal cut-off value of serum 
      klotho for predicting cerebrovascular disease in hemodialysis patients was 
      137.22 pg/ml, with a specificity of 96.4% and a sensitivity of 46.7%. But serum 
      klotho was not an independent risk factor of cognitive impairment for hemodialysis 
      patients with cerebrovascular disease (HR((95%CI) = 1.002(0.986-1.018), p = 0.776) 
      or with cerebral infarction (HR(95%CI) = 1.005(0.987-1.023), p = 0.576). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The serum klotho level is a potential predictor of cerebrovascular 
      disease in hemodialysis patients, but it is not an independent risk factor of 
      cognitive impairment for hemodialysis patients with cerebrovascular disease.

TI  - Association of sclerostin with cardiovascular events and mortality in dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 282-288
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2020.1741386 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Sclerostin has been reported to be a novel biomarker associated with 
      the bone-vascular axis. In this study, we determined the relationships between serum 
      sclerostin and all-cause mortality, the prevalence of cardiovascular events (CVEs), 
      and coronary artery calcifications (CACs) in dialysis patients.Methods: A total of 
      165 dialysis patients (84 hemodialysis [HD] and 81 peritoneal dialysis [PD]) were 
      enrolled in this study. We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to 
      test the relationships between serum sclerostin levels and demographics and clinical 
      parameters. We also performed Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to 
      determine independent predictors of overall survival and CVEs.Results: The median 
      serum sclerostin level was 250.9 pg/mL in dialysis patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
      showed that both overall and CVE-free survival rates were significantly lower in the 
      high serum sclerostin group (serum sclerostin level >250.9 pg/mL) compared to the 
      low serum sclerostin group (serum sclerostin level ≤250.9 pg/mL) in patients with PD 
      (p < 0.05). In patients with HD, only CVE-free survival rates notably declined in 
      the high serum sclerostin group compared to the low serum sclerostin group 
      (p = 0.029). However, serum sclerostin level was only an independent predictor of 
      all-cause mortality and CVEs in patients with PD after adjusting for confounding 
      factors (p < 0.05), and therefore was not an independent predictor for patients with 
      HD (p > 0.05).Conclusions: A low serum sclerostin was associated with better overall 
      survival and lower prevalence of CVEs in patients with PD, but had no relationships 
      in patients with HD. We found that serum sclerostin level was not correlated with 
      CACs in either patients with HD or PD.

TI  - Bone fracture risk factors in prevalent hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 205-212
LID - 10.1007/s00774-019-01041-9 [doi]
AB  - Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of fractures in a 
      cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with possible risk 
      factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 patients, since they started 
      HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters as well 
      as vascular calcifications (VC) were evaluated. Fifty-seven episodes of fracture 
      were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months (incidence rate of 31 per 1000 
      person-years). Age (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.02), 
      and higher VC score (p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of 
      fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p = 0.03) was associated with decreased 
      risk. A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with 
      higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) (p = 0.01) and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either < 300 pg/mL (p = 0.02) or > 800 pg/mL 
      (p < 0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. In conclusion, bone fracture incidence in 
      HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, lower serum 
      albumin, and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high 
      iPTH levels or increased bALP also had a higher fracture risk. Therapy with active 
      vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and 
      management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial calcification (AC) is a common complication in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients that starts to develop before these patients need renal 
      replacement therapy. In these patients, calcification can involve tunica intima or 
      tunica media. This study has looked for the prevalence, severity, and distribution 
      of arterial wall calcification in incident hemodialysis patients through 
      intraoperative arterial biopsy obtained during creation of arteriovenous vascular 
      access for hemodialysis. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults 
      (98 male and 74 female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained 
      arterial samples, all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF23), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D. RESULTS: Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC 
      (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal (subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), 
      while 21 (12%) had both intimal and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six 
      patients (50%) were devoid of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly 
      higher serum level of PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose 
      significant difference in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. 
      On the other hand, there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, 
      serum PTH, and FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification. 
      CONCLUSION: Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly in 
      tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification intensity.

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and 
      is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the 
      association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial stiffness 
      has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING trial (vitamin K2 
      In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the association between the 
      change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial stiffness following 8 weeks of 
      menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360 μg once daily) among renal 
      transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness was measured using 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical vitamin K deficiency was 
      defined as plasma concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla 
      protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had 
      subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% 
      reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV 
      post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 ± 1.5 m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also 
      significantly reduced by 55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a 
      reduction in the prevalence of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When 
      controlled for age, durations of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 
      24-hour mean arterial pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was 
      independently associated with the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration 
      (P = .014).Among renal transplant recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 
      supplementation was associated with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency 
      and arterial stiffness. (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02517580).

AB  - BACKWARD: Cardiovascular events are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inflammation and mineral-bone disorder 
      are pathological conditions that have been associated with an increased 
      cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: Show paricalcitol regulation overinflammatory, 
      fibrotic and mineral disorder parameters in CKD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective 
      Study in 46 CKD stages III-V patients without dialysis patients whith elevated 
      parathormone in which we introduced paricalcitol. We evaluated classic and newest 
      mineral and bone metabolism serum parameters (calcium, phosphorus, parathormone, 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23], Klotho, calcidiol), inflammatory-fibrosis and 
      anticalcifying parameters (interleukin-6 and 10, tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF- α], 
      transforming growth factor-b [TGF-β],bone morphogenic protein-7 [BMP-7] and 
      fetuin-A) for four months. RESULTS: At the end of study soluble Klotho increased 
      (p=.001), FGF-23 remained stable, calcium and phosphorus levels were not increased, 
      calcidiol increased (p=.010) and PTH decreased (p=.002). Inflammation-fibrosis and 
      calcification parameters showed positive regulation after paricalcitol treatment: 
      interleukin-6 decreased significantly (p=.001) and also TNF-α did (p=.005), on the 
      contrary, interleukin-10 and fetuin-A increased (p=.001 for both). Anti-fibrosis 
      marker BMP-7 increased (p=.001) and TGF-b decreased (p=.001). We did not find 
      significant changes in renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Paricalcitol treatment might be 
      profitable in regulating inflammatory and anticalcificant parameters, unmodified 
      calcium or phosphorus seric levels and preserving kidney function in renal patients 
      with no dialysis. Our selected parameters could indicate paricalcitol effects in 
      mineral and endothelial disorder related to renal disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5) are predisposed to 
      vascular calcification (VC), but the combined effect of factors associated with VC 
      was sparsely investigated. We applied the relaxed linear separability (RLS) feature 
      selection model to identify features that concomitantly associate with VC in CKD5 
      patients. METHODS: Epigastric arteries collected during surgery from living donor 
      kidney transplant recipients were examined to score the histological extent of 
      medial VC. Sixty-two phenotypic features in 152 patients were entered into RLS model 
      to differentiate between no-minimal VC (n = 93; score 0-1) and moderate-extensive VC 
      (n = 59; score 2-3). The subset of features associated with VC was selected on the 
      basis of cross-validation procedure. The strength of association of the selected 
      features with VC was expressed by the absolute value of 'RLS factor'. RESULTS: Among 
      62 features, a subset of 17 features provided optimal prediction of VC with 89% of 
      patients correctly classified into their groups. The 17 features included 
      traditional risk factors (diabetes, age, cholesterol, BMI and male sex) and markers 
      of bone metabolism, endothelial function, metabolites, serum antibodies and 
      mitochondrial-derived peptide. Positive RLS factors range from 1.26 to 4.05 
      indicating features associated with increased risk of VC, and negative RLS factors 
      range from -0.95 to -1.83 indicating features associated with reduced risk of VC. 
      CONCLUSION: The RLS model identified 17 features including novel biomarkers and 
      traditional risk factors that together concomitantly associated with medial VC. 
      These results may inform further investigations of factors promoting VC in CKD5 
      patients.

      Receiving Renal Replacement Therapy.
PG  - 181-187

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In patients with advanced-stage chronic kidney disease, renal 
      insufficiency, arterial stiffness, and vascular calcification are strong predictors 
      of cardiovascular risk. Signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like protein-1 (SCUBE1) levels 
      increase during platelet activation and acute ischemic events. Here, we evaluated 
      associations between SCUBE1 levels and electrocardiographic/echocardiographic 
      findings, epicardial adipose tissue thickness, and carotid intimamedia thickness in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 21 
      renal transplant recipients, 20 peritoneal dialysis patients, 20 hemodialysis 
      patients, 20 predialysis patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and 
      16 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: We found no differences in SCUBE1 levels between 
      patient groups and healthy volunteers, regardless of history of diabetes mellitus, 
      myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, and hypertension. SCUBE1 levels 
      correlated with C-reactive protein in renal transplant recipients; magnesium in 
      peritoneal dialysis patients; erythrocyte sedimentation rate in predialysis 
      patients; and parathyroid hormone, platelet count, calcium-phosphate product, and 
      calcium in hemo dialysis patients. No associations were shown between SCUBE1 levels 
      and electrocardiographic/echocardiographic findings. Elevated C-reactive protein in 
      predialysis patients was associated with cardiac valvular pathologies. In 
      hemodialysis patients, SCUBE1 levels increased after hemodialysis (P = .007). Levels 
      were higher in healthy individuals with normal echocardiography and predialysis 
      patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Positive correlations were 
      found between carotid intima-media thickness and SCUBE1 levels in dialysis patients 
      (P < .05), but no study groups showed correlations regarding epicardial adipose 
      tissue thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis may contribute to cardiovascular events 
      because of increased SCUBE1 levels after hemodialysis; however, no association was 
      shown between SCUBE1 and electrocardiography/echocardiography findings. We found no 
      correlations between epicardial adipose tissue thickness and SCUBE1 levels, and 
      levels were significantly higher in healthy patients and in predialysis patients 
      without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. However, correlations were shown 
      between SCUBE1 levels and carotid intima-media thickness and secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism markers, indicating associations with atherosclerosis and bone 
      mineral disease in dialysis patients.

      CKD: The CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent among 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases risks for cardiovascular 
      disease events and mortality. We hypothesized that a novel serum measure of 
      calcification propensity is associated with CAC among patients with CKD stages 2 
      to 4. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Participants 
      from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study with baseline (n=1,274) and 
      follow-up (n=780) CAC measurements. PREDICTORS: Calcification propensity, quantified 
      as transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, 
      with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. Covariates 
      included age, sex, race/ethnicity, clinical site, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, proteinuria, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive 
      medications, current smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, total cholesterol 
      level, and use of statin medications. OUTCOMES: CAC prevalence, severity, incidence, 
      and progression. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear 
      models. RESULTS: At baseline, 824 (65%) participants had prevalent CAC. After 
      multivariable adjustment, T(50) was not associated with CAC prevalence but was 
      significantly associated with greater CAC severity among participants with prevalent 
      CAC: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 21% (95% CI, 6%-38%) greater CAC severity. 
      Among 780 participants followed up an average of 3 years later, 65 (20%) without 
      baseline CAC developed incident CAC, while 89 (19%) with baseline CAC had 
      progression, defined as annual increase≥100 Agatston units. After multivariable 
      adjustment, T(50) was not associated with incident CAC but was significantly 
      associated with CAC progression: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 28% (95% CI, 
      7%-53%) higher risk for CAC progression. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias in 
      follow-up analyses; inability to distinguish intimal from medial calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2 to 4, higher serum calcification 
      propensity is associated with more severe CAC and CAC progression.

TI  - The impact of vascular calcification among dialysis-dependent South African 
      patients: A 5-year follow-up study .
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.5414/CN110010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In Western 
      countries, Blacks appear to have lesser degrees of vascular calcification compared 
      to non-Blacks. However, there is no published data from sub-Saharan Africa. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study assessed the 5-year change in vascular 
      calcification and mortality in a previously published cohort of patients with ESRD. 
      Vascular calcification was assessed by abdominal aortic calcification score and 
      vascular stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: 66 of the original 74 
      participants studied at baseline were identified. The median age was 46.6 years 
      (37.6 - 59.2), and 57.6% were women. Abdominal aortic calcification showed no 
      progression among Blacks (baseline range 0 - 5, follow-up range 0 - 8 (p = 1.00)), 
      but a trend to progression among non-Blacks (baseline range 0 - 19, follow up range 
      0 - 22 (p = 0.066)). Black participants did not display a survival advantage 
      (p = 0.870). Non-Blacks had higher parathyroidectomy rates than Blacks with 9/30 
      cases compared to 2/36 (p = 0.036). After adjustment for parathyroidectomy at 
      follow-up, the odds ratio of having abdominal vascular calcification score of ≥ 1 
      amongst non-Blacks was 8.6-fold greater compared to Blacks (p = 0.03). A positive 
      correlation (r = 0.5) was observed between PWV and abdominal aortic calcification 
      (p = 0.047). Elevated baseline coronary artery calcification score and FGF-23 level 
      at baseline were not associated with a difference in mortality. CONCLUSION: There 
      was no significant progression in vascular calcification among Blacks. After 
      adjusting for increased parathyroidectomy rates, there was a greater progression of 
      vascular calcification amongst non-Blacks compared to Blacks.

TI  - Serum sclerostin levels are positively related to bone mineral density in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus 
      integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a potential 
      contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), which 
      has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular calcification. The 
      positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density (BMD) has been 
      demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between sclerostin and BMD in PD 
      patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were enrolled; their sera were collected 
      for measurement of sclerostin and other CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also 
      assessed simultaneously. We examined the relationship between sclerostin and each 
      parameter through Spearman correlation analysis and by comparing group data between 
      patients with above- and below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and multiple 
      logistic regression models were employed to define the most predictive of sclerostin 
      levels in the above-median category. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that 
      sclerostin was correlated with spine BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score 
      (r = 0.274, P = 0.010), spine BMD Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH; r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. 
      High BMD, old age, male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high 
      osteocalcin and uric acid levels were observed in patients with high serum 
      sclerostin levels and an inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin. 
      Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively 
      correlated with above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P = 0.002); 
      the correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 121.5, 
      P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a positive 
      association between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD population.

AB  - Coronary artery calcification is an acceptable tool for cardiovascular risk 
      assessment in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. We aimed to identify the 
      association and predictive value of components of blood cell parameters with 
      coronary and thoracic aorta vascular calcification (VC) in ESRD population on 
      dialysis. All ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis aged 
      between 18 and 60 years were included in the study. Exclusion criteria comprised 
      patients with active infection or inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, 
      congestive heart failure, angina pectoris and/or documented coronary artery disease, 
      thyroid disease, and hepatic dysfunction. Agatston scoring was used for the 
      evaluation of coronary aorta calcification (CAC) score (CACS) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification (TAC) score (TACS). Compared to participants with no VC, those who had 
      VC were statistically significantly older (P <0.001) and had higher 
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P = 
      0.02 and <0.001, respectively). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
      increasing age (P = 0.00) and higher PLR (P = 0.04) were associated with an 
      increased likelihood of exhibiting VC (CAC or TAC). There was a positive correlation 
      between CACS and age (rs = 0.495, P = 0.00). A statistically significant positive 
      correlation existed between TACS and age (rs = 0.516, P = 0.00). Similarly, a 
      positive correlation was found between NLR, PLR, and TACS (rs = 0.334, P = 0.001, 
      and rs = 0.438, P = 0.00, respectively). On multivariate linear regression analysis, 
      increased age and red cell distribution width were found to be significant 
      predictors of log(n) TACS. PLR of 135 gave a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 
      50% for predicting VC. Being a cost-effective and easily available investigation, 
      the utilization of the correlation of NLR and PLR with CAC and TAC appears 
      promising, particularly in the age group of 30-60 years.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is a recently recognized complication in dialysis and 
      it is associated with a poor outcome. We estimated the prevalence of PHTN and its 
      association with vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. One hundred and thirteen adult CKD patients were 
      included in this study, of which 56 (49.6%) were on conservative treatment 
      (nondialysis group) and 57 (50.4%) were on maintenance HD (dialysis group). 
      Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were collected and compared 
      between the groups. Thirty-nine (69.6%) and 33 (57.8%) males were included in 
      nondialysis and dialysis group, respectively. Mean age was 47.5 ± 13.7 in 
      nondialysis group and 52.8 ± 13.9 in the dialysis group. PHTN was estimated using 
      Doppler echocardiography and peripheral vascular calcification by lateral lumbar 
      X-ray with aortic calcification scoring. Patients with and without PHTN and vascular 
      calcification in dialysis and nondialysis group were compared. PHTN was found in 55 
      patients (48.7%) and it was high in patients on dialysis compared to 
      nondialysis(59.6% vs. 37.5%, P <0.019). Abdominal aortic calcification was present 
      in 35 patients (30.9%), dialysis versus nondialysis group was 22.8% and 39.3%. 
      Increased left atrial diameter was significantly associated with PHTN (P <0.003), 
      whereas peripheral artery calcification was not related to PHT (P = 0.248). The 
      prevalence of PHTN in CKD was 48.7% which was higher in dialysis group than non 
      dialysis group. Increased left atrial (LA) diameter was associated with PHTN but not 
      peripheral arterial calcification.

TI  - Significance of acPWV for Survival of Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - 10.3390/medicina56090435 [doi]
LID - 435
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Abnormal arterial stiffness (AS) is a major complication 
      in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients treated by dialysis. Our study aimed to 
      determine the significance of AS for survival of prevalent dialysis patients, as 
      well as its association with cardiovascular parameters or vascular calcification 
      promoters/inhibitors or both and AS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 80 
      adult hemodialysis patients. Besides standard laboratory analyses, we also 
      determined promoters and inhibitors of vascular calcification (bone biomarkers): 
      serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), soluble Klotho, intact 
      parathormone (iPTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin, AS 
      measured as ankle carotid pulse wave velocity (acPWV), Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), 
      and vascular calcification (VC) score. Patients were monitored for up to 28 months. 
      According to the median acPWV value, we divided patients into a group with acPWV ≤ 
      8.8 m/s, and a group with acPWV > 8.8 m/s, and the two groups were compared. 
      RESULTS: Values for bone biomarkers were similar in both groups. Mean arterial blood 
      pressure (MAP), central systolic and diastolic brachial blood pressure, heart rate, 
      and pulse pressure were higher in the group with acPWV > 8.8 m/s than in the group 
      with acPWV ≤ 8.8 m/s. The mortality was higher for patients with acPWV > 8.8 m/s at 
      any given time over 28 months of follow-up. In multivariable analysis, predictors of 
      higher acPWV were age >60.5, higher pulse rate, and higher central systolic or 
      brachial diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, we advise 
      the measurement of acPWV preferentially in younger dialysis patients for prognosis, 
      as well as intervention planning before the development of irreversible changes in 
      blood vessels. In addition, measuring central systolic blood pressure seems to be 
      useful for monitoring AS in prevalent hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) 
      score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. METHODS: Between the 
      years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored 
      for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, 
      cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC 
      (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 
      months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. 
      For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and 
      mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar 
      after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and 
      diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high 
      versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 
      (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), 
      and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking 
      history-adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with 
      high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than 
      recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted 
      risk-lowering strategies.

TI  - Fractional excretion of phosphorus and vascular calcification in stage 3 chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 674-680
LID - 10.1136/jim-2018-000852 [doi]
AB  - The role of renal excretion of Pi in relation to vascular calcification (VC) in 
      patients in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. Thus, 
      we determine the relation between fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) and VC, 
      measured using two methods in a cross-sectional study of patients with stage 3 CKD. 
      We recorded demographic data, anthropometry, comorbidities and active treatment. We 
      measured 24-hour urine FEP and, in serum, measured fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF23), α-Klotho, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus. VC was 
      measured by lateral abdominal radiography (Kauppila index (KI)) and CT of the 
      abdominal aorta (measured in Agatston units). In 57% of subjects, abnormal VC was 
      present when measured using CT, and in only 17% using lateral abdominal radiography. 
      Factors associated with VC using CT were age, cardiovascular risk factors, vascular 
      comorbidity, microalbuminuria and levels of FGF23, phosphorus and calcium x 
      phosphorus product (CaxP); although only age (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.41), smoking 
      (OR 21.2, CI 4.4 to 100) and CaxP (OR 1.21, CI 1.06 to 1.37) maintained the 
      association in a multivariate analysis. By contrast, only age (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 
      to 1.74), CaxP (OR 1.14, CI 1.13 to 1.92) and FEP (OR 1.07,95% CI 1004 to 1.14) were 
      associated with abnormal VC in the lateral abdominal radiography. In conclusion, in 
      patients with stage 3 CKD, the detection of VC by abdominal CT is more sensitive 
      than conventional X-rays. Moreover, CaxP is associated with cardiovascular risk 
      factors and vascular comorbidity; quantification of FEPi in these patients provides 
      additional clinical information in advanced VC detected by KI.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification score and common iliac artery calcification score in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients.
PG  - 837-845
LID - 10.1111/nep.13113 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Many studies have validated Agatston's coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) for assessing vascular calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. This study aimed to evaluate the CACS and common iliac artery 
      calcification score (IACS) and to examine the variables related to each score. 
      METHODS: The subjects were 145 non-dialysis CKD patients. The CACS and IACS were 
      determined using the same thoracicoabdominal multi-detector computed tomography. 
      Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with 
      the CACS or IACS. The associations between progression to renal replacement therapy 
      (RRT) and the CACS or IACS were studied using Cox hazards models. RESULTS: The 
      subjects' median age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and follow-up 
      period were 72 (62-78) years, 32 (18-50) mL/min/1.73m(2) , and 864 (550-1425) days, 
      respectively. Age, diabetes, the serum phosphate level, and the eGFR were found to 
      be significant factors of the CACS [β (95% CI): 0.38 (0.02-0.04), P < 0.0001, 0.28 
      (0.19-0.50), P < 0.0001, 0.16 (0.03-0.45), P < 0.05 and -0.15 (-0.02-0.00), 
      P < 0.05, respectively]. Age and diabetes were shown to be significant factors of 
      the IACS [β (95% CI): 0.53 (0.04-0.06), P < 0.0001, and 0.18 (0.07-0.40), P < 0.01, 
      respectively]. Progression to RRT occurred in 31 patients and was significantly 
      associated with the CACS (hazard ratio: 1.01, P < 0.01), urinary protein level and 
      eGFR, but not the IACS. CONCLUSION: Chronic kidney disease related risk factors for 
      VC, such as the eGFR and hyperphosphataemia, are significantly associated with a 
      high CACS, but not a high IACS, and the CACS is a significant predictor of 
      progression to RRT.

TI  - Does statins promote vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 137-148
LID - 10.1111/eci.12718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve 
      survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is 
      unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and 
      mortality in ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; 
      median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal 
      dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor 
      (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated 
      in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism. 
      RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate 
      analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, 
      male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and 
      mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use 
      of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 
      patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. 
      In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. 
      CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of 
      inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular 
      calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

TI  - Circulating CTRP9 correlates with the prevention of aortic calcification in renal

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis is a major cause of 
      death in renal allograft recipients. Recently, C1q/TNF-α related protein-9 (CTRP9), 
      which is a paralog of adiponectin (ADPN), has been suggested to be related to the 
      prevention of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of CVD, but this relationship has 
      not been confirmed in renal allograft recipients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The 
      relationships among the serum CTRP9 concentration, serum ADPN concentration, and 
      vascular calcification were investigated in 50 kidney transplantation recipients at 
      our hospital. Calcification of the abdominal aorta was evaluated according to the 
      aortic calcification area index (ACAI) calculated from CT images. Changes in the 
      serum CTRP9 and ADPN fractions and ACAI were examined for 8 years. In addition, the 
      expression of CTRP9 and ADPN and their respective receptors AdipoR1 and R2 in 
      muscular arteries of the kidney was examined by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In 
      renal allograft recipients, the serum CTRP9 concentration at the start of the 
      observation was not significant correlated with eGFR or serum high-molecular-weight 
      (HMW)-ADPN concentration (rS = -0.009, p = 0.950; rS = -0.226, p = 0.114, 
      respectively). However, the change in the serum CTRP9 concentration was positively 
      correlated with the change in the serum HMW-ADPN concentration (rS = 0.315, p = 
      0.026) and negatively correlated with the change in ACAI (rS = -0.367, p = 0.009). 
      Multiple regression analysis revealed that the serum HMW-ADPN concentration was a 
      significant positive factor for the change in the serum CTRP9 concentration. 
      Moreover, for ACAI, an increase in the serum CTRP9 concentration was an improving 
      factor, but aging was an exacerbating factor. Furthermore, colocalization of CTRP9 
      and AdipoR1 was noted in the luminal side of intra-renal arterial intima. 
      CONCLUSION: In renal allograft recipients, both CTRP9 and HMW-ADPN were suggested to 
      prevent the progression of aortic calcification through AdipoR1.

TI  - A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study of long-term and incident hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 615-626
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00593-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular morphology and function in long-term survivors of 
      hemodialysis are not well described. METHODS: Single-center cross-sectional study 
      nested within a prospective cohort study of 15 long-term (> 7.5 years) and 15 
      matched incident (< 6 months) hemodialysis patients with 15 external matched 
      controls. Evaluations included heart structure, function and fibrosis (myocardial 
      longitudinal relaxation time, native T1), and aortic dimensions and elasticity, 
      using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      scores were evaluated from computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Incident hemodialysis 
      patients had significantly increased left ventricular mass, greater aortic 
      dimensions and reduced aortic distensibility compared to long-term survivors, 
      whereas the CAC score was significantly higher in long-term than incident patients, 
      median (95% CI) 1127 (10-3861) vs 14 (0-268). Both incident and long-term 
      hemodialysis groups had significantly higher native T1 values compared to controls, 
      mean (95% CI) 1300 ms (1273-1326), 1274 ms (1243-1305) versus 1224 ms (1202-1246), 
      respectively, suggesting interstitial fibrosis or edema. Compared to controls, both 
      hemodialysis groups also had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction: 
      48.7% (43.6-53.9), 54.0% (48.3-59.7) versus 62.2% (58.0-66.4) and longitudinal 
      strain: 14.0% (11.7-16.2), 15.2% (12.7-17.7) versus 19.6% (17.8-21.5). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Incident hemodialysis patients had larger left ventricular mass and unfavorable 
      aortic structure and function compared to long-term survivors, despite a lower CAC 
      burden. Long-term survivors, despite normal ventricular mass and volumes, had signs 
      of fibrosis or edema, given their significantly increased native T1 values.

TI  - Progression of coronary artery calcification in conventional hemodialysis, nocturnal 
      hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation.
PG  - e0244639

LID - e0244639
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. An 
      important driver of vascular calcification is high phosphate levels, but these 
      become lower when patients initiate nocturnal hemodialysis or receive a kidney 
      transplant. However, it is unknown whether nocturnal hemodialysis or kidney 
      transplantation mitigate vascular calcification. Therefore, we compared progression 
      of coronary artery calcification (CAC) between patients treated with conventional 
      hemodialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We 
      measured CAC annually up to 3 years in 114 patients with ESRD that were 
      transplantation candidates: 32 that continued conventional hemodialysis, 34 that 
      initiated nocturnal hemodialysis (≥4x 8 hours/week), and 48 that received a kidney 
      transplant. We compared CAC progression between groups as the difference in square 
      root transformed volume scores per year (ΔCAC SQRV) using linear mixed models. 
      Reference category was conventional hemodialysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the study 
      population was 53 ±13 years, 75 (66%) were male, and median dialysis duration was 28 
      (IQR 12-56) months. Median CAC score at enrollment was 171 (IQR 10-647), which did 
      not differ significantly between treatment groups (P = 0.83). Compared to 
      conventional hemodialysis, CAC progression was non-significantly different in 
      nocturnal hemodialysis -0.10 (95% CI -0.77 to 0.57) and kidney transplantation -0.33 
      (95% CI -0.96 to 0.29) in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal hemodialysis and 
      kidney transplantation are not associated with significantly less CAC progression 
      compared to conventional hemodialysis during up to 3 years follow-up. Further 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings, to determine which type of 
      calcification is measured with CAC in end-stage renal disease, and whether that 
      reflects cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Sodium thiosulphate and progression of vascular calcification in end-stage renal 
      disease patients: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 162-169
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulphate (NaTS) is mostly used in haemodialysis (HD) patients 
      with calcific uraemic arteriolopathy. This double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study assessed the effect of NaTS on progression of 
      cardiovascular calcifications in HD patients. METHODS: From 65 screened patients, we 
      recruited 60 patients with an abdominal aorta Agatston calcification score ≥100. 
      Thirty patients were randomized to receive NaTS 25 g/1.73 m2 and 30 patients to 
      receive 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously during the last 15 min of HD 
      over a period of 6 months. The primary endpoint was the absolute change of the 
      abdominal aortic calcification score. RESULTS: The abdominal aortic calcification 
      score and calcification volume of the abdominal aorta increased similarly in both 
      treatment groups during the trial. As compared with the saline group, patients 
      receiving NaTS exhibited a reduction of their iliac artery calcification score 
      (-137 ± 641 versus 245  ± 755; P = 0.049), reduced pulse wave velocity (9.6  ± 2.7 
      versus 11.4 ± 3.6; P = 0.000) and a lower carotid intima-media thickness 
      (0.77  ± 0.1 versus 0.83  ±  00.17; P = 0.033) and had better preservation of 
      echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy. No patient of the NaTS 
      group developed new cardiac valve calcifications during the trial as compared with 8 
      of 29 patients in the saline group. By univariate analysis, NaTS therapy was the 
      only predictor of not developing new valvular calcifications. No adverse events 
      possibly related to NaTS infusion were noted. CONCLUSIONS: While NaTS failed to 
      retard abdominal aortic calcification progress, it positively affected calcification 
      progress in iliac arteries and heart valves as well as several other cardiovascular 
      functional parameters.

TI  - The Effect of Long-Term Cholecalciferol Supplementation on Vascular Calcification in 
      Chronic Kidney Disease Patients With Hypovitaminosis D.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of vitamin D supplementation on vascular calcification (VC) in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate the effects of long-term cholecalciferol supplementation on VC 
      in nondialysis patients with CKD stages 3-4 with hypovitaminosis D. DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Eighty patients aged 18-85 years with creatinine clearance between 15 and 
      60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and serum 25(OH)D level < 30 ng/mL were enrolled in a 18-month 
      prospective study. Individuals with vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      [25(OH)D] level between 16 and 29 ng/mL) were included in a randomized, 
      double-blind, two-arm study to receive cholecalciferol or placebo. Patients with 
      vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 15 ng/mL] were included in an observational study 
      and mandatorily received cholecalciferol. The coronary artery calcium score was 
      obtained by multislice computed tomography at baseline and the 18th month. RESULTS: 
      During the study, VC did not change in the treated insufficient group (418 [81-611] 
      to 364 [232-817] AU, P = 0.25) but increased in the placebo group (118 [37-421] to 
      199 [49-490] AU, P = 0.01). The calcium score change was inversely correlated with 
      25(OH)D change (r = -0.45; P = 0.037) in the treated insufficient group but not in 
      the placebo group. Renal function did not change in the insufficient, treated, and 
      placebo groups. In multivariate analysis, there was no difference in VC progression 
      between the treated and placebo insufficient groups (interaction P = 0.92). In the 
      deficient group, VC progressed (265 [84-733] to 333 [157-745] AU; P = 0.006) and 
      renal function declined (33 [26-43] to 23 [17-49] mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.04). The 
      calcium score change was inversely correlated with cholecalciferol cumulative doses 
      (r = -0.41; P = 0.048) and kidney function change (r = -0.43; P = 0.033) but not 
      with 25(OH)D change (r = -0.08; P = 0.69). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did 
      not attenuate VC progression in CKD patients with hypovitaminosis D. CONCLUSION: 
      Vitamin D supplementation did not attenuate VC progression in CKD patients with 
      hypovitaminosis D.

TI  - Different type and dosage of heparin were not associated with the progression of 
      coronary artery calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 551-558
LID - 10.1111/nep.13632 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Several studies have verified that unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low 
      molecular heparin (LWMH) can induce bone loss, and bone mineral density has been 
      inversely associated with vascular calcification in some clinical researches. But 
      few have focused on the relationship between types and dosages of heparin and the 
      progression of vascular calcification. We observed the progression of coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients who were 
      treated with UFH and LMWH. METHODS: This was a prospective prevalent cohort study of 
      MHD patients. Computed tomography was performed at enrolment and 2 years after 
      enrolment, and CAC score was obtained. Demographic and clinical data, baseline and 
      time-average laboratory indices were collected. Multiple linear regression and 
      logistic regression were used to estimate the influencing factors of progression of 
      CAC. RESULTS: In this study, (i) we initially enrolled 69 HD patients, and then 56 
      patients finished the follow-up. (ii) Among the total 56 patients, 27 patients 
      (48.2%) were treated with UFH, 14 (25.0%) with LMWH and 15 (26.8%) with both. The 
      median baseline CAC scores of three groups (UFH, LMWH and both users) were 91.0 
      (1.0, 1052.0), 134.0 (0, 1292.0) and 250.5 (27.0, 1139.0), respectively, with no 
      significant difference (P = 0.663); the median CAC progression scores were 42.0 (0, 
      364.0), 172.0 (7.0, 653.0) and 118.5 (0, 434.0), respectively, with no significant 
      difference (P = 0.660). (iii) Pearson and spearman correlation analysis shown that 
      the progression of CAC was not associated with cumulative dosage of heparin used. 
      (iv) After adjusted for diabetes mellitus, time-averaged intact parathyroid hormone, 
      phosphate and alkaline phosphatase, logistic regression analysis showed using 
      different types of heparin was not an independent risk factor for CAC progression; 
      and multiple linear regression analysis showed that the type of heparin used was not 
      associated with CAC progression. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences 
      in the effects of the types and dosages of heparin on CAC progression in patients on 
      haemodialysis.

      calcification in female and male end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 59

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of cardiac events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients are predicted by coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      independently. It is not clear to what extent low bone mineral density (BMD) is 
      associated with higher risk of CAC and if sex interacts. We investigated the 
      sex-specific associations of CAC score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with 
      BMD of different skeletal sub-regions. METHODS: In 174 ESRD patients, median age 57 
      (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63% males, BMD (measured by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac CT) and circulating 
      inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 104 (60%) patients with 
      CAC > 100 AUs were older, had higher prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, 
      higher level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, 
      interleukin-6 and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower 
      tBMD and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients. Female 
      patients with high CAC (> 100 AUs) had significantly decreased T-score of tBMD, and 
      lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC (≤ 100 AUs); elevated CAC score were 
      associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no 
      such differences was observed in males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) 
      analysis adjusted for age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher 
      CAC score (1057 AUs) was predicted by either per SD (0.13 g/cm(2)) lower tBMD or per 
      SD (0.17 g/cm(2)) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found in male ESRD 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In female, but not male, lower BMD, in particular sub-regions 
      of legs, was associated with higher CAC score independently. Low BMD has the 
      potential to identify increased risk for high CAC score in ESRD patients.

LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0218-2 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical relevance of 
      aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients. METHODS: Between January 2010 and 
      September 2014, 1221 patients with urolithiasis were treated in Oyokyo Kidney 
      Research Institute and Hirosaki University Hospital. Among these, 287 patients 
      (Stone group) on whom adequate data were available were included in this 
      retrospective study. We also selected 148 subjects with early stage (pT1N0M0) renal 
      cell carcinoma from 607 renal cell carcinoma patients who underwent radical 
      nephrectomy at Hirosaki University Hospital (Non-stone group) as control subjects. 
      Validity of the Non-stone group was evaluated by comparison with pair-matched 296 
      volunteers from 1166 subjects who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project 
      in 2014. Thereafter, age, body mass index, aortic calcification index (ACI), renal 
      function, serum uric acid concentrations, and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, 
      or cardiovascular disease) were compared between the Non-stone and Stone groups. 
      Independent factors for higher ACI and impaired renal function were assessed using 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed relevance of 
      Non-stone group patients as a control subject by comparing the pair-matched 
      community-dwelling volunteers. Backgrounds of patients between the Non-stone and 
      Stone groups were not significantly different except for the presence of 
      hypertension in the Stone group. ACI was not significantly high in the Stone group 
      compared with the Non-stone group. However, age-adjusted ACI was greater in the 
      Stone group than the Non-stone group. Among urolithiasis patients, ACI was 
      significantly higher in uric acid containing stone patients. The number of patients 
      with stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in the Stone 
      group than in the Non-stone group (12% vs. 4%, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis showed higher aortic calcification index (>13%), and being a 
      stone former were independent factors for stage 3B CKD at the time of diagnosis. 
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification and being a stone former had harmful influence on 
      renal function. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN: UMIN000022962.

AB  - Vascular calcifications worse outcomes in the general population and in patients on 
      dialysis. We investigated 146 patients on chronic hemodialysis and 63 healthy 
      controls with normal renal function under 65 years of age. All subjects underwent 
      B-mode ultrasonography of common and internal carotid artery, abdominal aorta, 
      common and superficial femoral artery and posterior tibial artery to assess the 
      presence of intimal and medial calcifications. Intimal and media calcifications were 
      present at the level of the carotid vessel, the abdominal aorta, the common femoral 
      artery, the superficial femoral artery and the posterior tibial artery, respectively 
      in 45%, 50%, 45%, 50%, 42% of patients on dialysis and in 5%, 15%, 24%, 5%, 2% of 
      controls (p <0,01). On multivariate logistic analysis of regression, after 
      adjustment for potential confounders, carotid intimal calcification, abdominal 
      aortic calcification, medial calcification of the superficial femoral artery and 
      posterior tibial artery calcification were associated with dialysis and with 
      cardiovascular disease. Only intimal arterial calcification were associated with 
      older age and smoking. Vascular calcifications are extremely common in middle-aged 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis. Ultrasonography currently available in Nephrology, 
      is a sensitive, reproducible, inexpensive imaging technique to identify arterial 
      intimal and medial calcification in high-risk cardiovascular subjects.

TI  - Increased Aortic Arch Calcification and Cardiomegaly is Associated with Rapid Renal 
      Progression and Increased Cardiovascular Mortality in Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - Vascular calcification and cardiomegaly are highly prevalent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. However, the association of the combination of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) with clinical outcomes in 
      patients with CKD is not well investigated. This study investigated whether the 
      combination of AoAC and CTR is associated with poor clinical outcomes in CKD stages 
      3-5 patients. We enrolled 568 CKD patients, and AoAC and CTR were determined by 
      chest radiography at enrollment. Rapid renal progression was defined as estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year. Both 
      AoAC score and CTR were significantly associated with rapid renal progression. High 
      CTR was correlated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. We stratified 
      the patients into four groups according to the median AoAC score of 4 and CTR of 
      50%. Those with AoAC ≥ 4 and CTR ≥ 50% (vs. AoAC score < 4 and CTR < 50%) were 
      associated with eGFR decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year and cardiovascular 
      mortality. AoAC and CTR were independently associated with eGFR slope. In 
      conclusion, the combination of increased AoAC and cardiomegaly was associated with 
      rapid renal progression and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD 
      stage 3-5 patients. We suggest that evaluating AoAC and CTR on chest plain 
      radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method for detecting CKD patients at 
      high risk for adverse clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is a fatal complication in 
      dialysis. AoAC progression-related molecules in continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) remain unclear. METHODS: AoAC was estimated using plain chest 
      radiography scoring (AoACS) in 30 CAPD patients (age 49.3 ± 13.4 years). AoAC 
      progression was defined as increased AoACS on follow-up chest X-ray at the end of 
      the study (progressors). Fibroblast growth factor-23 and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were 
      measured. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 38.5 months. Progressors were older, had 
      shorter PD vintage, higher body mass index, and higher serum OPG levels (255.6 ± 
      109.2 pg/mL) than nonprogressors (183.4 ± 68.2 pg/mL; p = 0.0400). Progressors also 
      showed higher pulse pressure (62.4 ± 20.0 mm Hg) and pulse wave velocity (1,909.9 ± 
      310.6 cm/s) than nonprogressors (48.5 ± 13.6 mm Hg; p = 0.0030 and 1,390.1 ± 252.8 
      cm/s; p = 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSION: AoAC progression was associated with 
      increased aortic stiffness. OPG may be associated with AoAC progression in CAPD.

LID - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a life threatening complication in renal patients. Of 
      great importance is the identification of concomitant factors for calciphylaxis. Due 
      to the variability of clinical presentation the evaluation of such factors may be 
      obscured when calciphylaxis diagnosis is based just on clinical features. We aimed 
      to characterize associated factors only in patients with calciphylaxis proven by 
      histomorphological parameters in addition to clinical presentation. METHODS: In a 
      single center retrospective study we analyzed 15 patients in an 8 year period from 
      2008 to 2016. Only patients with clinical features and histomorphological proof of 
      calciphylaxis were included. Criteria for histological diagnosis of calciphylaxis 
      were intimal hyperplasia, micro thrombi or von Kossa stain positive media 
      calcification. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Nine patients (60%) 
      were female; 12 (80%) were obese with a Body-Mass-Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2); 3 (20%) 
      had no renal disease; 12 (80%) had CKD 4 or 5 and 10 (66.7%) had end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD). One-year mortality in the entire cohort was 73.3%. With respect to 
      medication history, the majority of patients (n = 13 (86.7%)) received vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKA); 10 (66.7%) were treated with vitamin D; 6 (40%) had oral calcium 
      supplementation; 5 (33.3%) had been treated with corticosteroids; 12 (80%) were on 
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI); 13 (86.7%) patients had a clinical proven 
      hyperparathyroidism. Ten (66.7%) patients presented with hypoalbuminemia at 
      diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of biopsy proven calciphylaxis demonstrates 
      that especially treatment with vitamin K antagonists and liver dysfunction are most 
      important concomitant factors in development of calciphylaxis. As progression and 
      development of calciphylaxis are chronic rather than acute processes, early use of 
      DOACs instead of VKA might be beneficial and reduce the incidence of calciphylaxis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several histologic features have been identified in the 
      upper-extremity arteries and veins of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, 
      which may affect arteriovenous fistula maturation. However, it is unclear whether 
      these chronic kidney disease vascular features are abnormal. METHODS: We obtained 
      upper-extremity arterial and venous specimens from 125 advanced chronic kidney 
      disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula creation and from 15 control 
      subjects. We quantified medial fibrosis, micro-calcification, and intimal 
      hyperplasia with appropriate histology stains. We characterized medial collagen 
      fiber configuration in second-harmonic-generation microscopy images for the fiber 
      anisotropy index and the dominant fiber direction. RESULTS: The advanced chronic 
      kidney disease patients were significantly younger than control subjects 
      (53 ± 14 years vs 76 ± 11 years, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, the chronic 
      kidney disease patients had greater arterial medial fibrosis (69% ± 14% vs 
      51% ± 10%, p < 0.001) and greater arterial micro-calcification (3.03% ± 5.17% vs 
      0.01% ± 0.03%, p = 0.02), but less arterial intimal thickness (30 ± 25 µm vs 
      63 ± 25 µm, p < 0.001), as compared to control subjects. The anisotropy index of 
      medial collagen fibers was lower in both arteries (0.24 ± 0.10 vs 0.44 ± 0.04, 
      p < 0.001) and veins (0.28 ± 0.09 vs 0.53 ± 0.10, p < 0.001) in chronic kidney 
      disease patients, indicating that orientation of the fibers was more disordered. The 
      dominant direction of medial collagen fibers in chronic kidney disease patients was 
      greater in the arteries (49.3° ± 23.6° vs 4.0° ± 2.0°, p < 0.001) and the veins 
      (30.0° ± 19.6° vs 3.9° ± 2.1°, p < 0.001), indicating that the fibers in general 
      were aligned more perpendicular to the lumen. CONCLUSION: Advanced chronic kidney 
      disease is associated with several abnormalities in vascular histology and collagen 
      fiber configuration. Future research is needed to investigate whether these 
      abnormalities affect the maturation outcomes of arteriovenous fistulas.

TI  - Vascular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients: 
      interrelationship and clinical impacts.
PG  - 557-563
LID - 10.7150/ijms.23700 [doi]
AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular 
      calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and 
      cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance HD 
      patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest radiographs 
      were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 100 patients 
      (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC 
      (70% vs. 50.2%, P=0.001). VC was independently associated with a 2.42-fold increased 
      risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients 
      with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was independently associated 
      with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or LVH alone was not. Patients 
      with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a composite event of deaths or CVE 
      (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant synergistic interaction was observed 
      between VC and LVH (P for interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently 
      associated with LVH. The coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk 
      of deaths and CVEs than either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic 
      interaction for the risk of deaths and CVEs.

TI  - Differences in Risk Factors and Prevalence of Vascular Calcification between 
      Pre-Dialysis and Hemodialysis Balkan Nephropathy Patients.
LID - 10.3390/medicina54010004 [doi]
LID - 4
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the risk factors and prevalence of 
      vascular calcification (VC) in pre-dialysis and hemodialysis (HD) patients with 
      Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) or other kidney diseases (non-BEN). Materials and 
      Methods: The study involved 115 patients, 32 pre-dialysis and 83 HD patients, 
      separated into groups of BEN and non-BEN patients. In addition to interviews, 
      objective examinations and laboratory analyses, VC was assessed using Adragao score. 
      Results: Patients with BEN were significantly older in both groups, while 
      pre-dialysis BEN patients had significantly lower systolic blood pressure, serum 
      cholesterol and phosphorus levels, but higher urinary excretion of phosphorus than 
      non-BEN patients. These differences were lost in HD groups. In pre-dialysis 
      patients, prevalence of VC was lower in BEN than in non-BEN group and mean VC score 
      differed significantly between them (2.8 (1.7) vs. 4.6 (1.8); p = 0.009). No 
      significant difference in VC score was found between BEN and non-BEN patients on HD. 
      Multivariate analysis showed that in pre-dialysis patients VC score >4 was 
      associated with lower iPTH and higher serum cholesterol level, but in the HD group 
      with higher serum triglyceride level and longer HD vintage. Conclusions: Lower 
      prevalence of risk factors for VC in the BEN than non-BEN patients was found in 
      pre-dialysis but not in HD group and this was reflected in the prevalence and 
      severity of VC in the groups. Prevalence of VC and mean VC score were significantly 
      lower in pre-dialysis BEN than in non-BEN patients but not for those on HD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) 
      have high cardiovascular risk. Both conditions are related to systemic 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. The prevalence and severity of coronary 
      artery calcification (CaC) is higher in patients with DM, regardless of their renal 
      function. Data about the long-term prognostic role of CaC in diabetic patients with 
      CKD are scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective longitudinal 
      study enrolling 137 patients with advanced CKD. A non-enhanced multislice coronary 
      computed tomography (CT) was performed at baseline. CaC was assessed using Agatston 
      method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC score: severe calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400HU) and mild-moderate calcification group (CaCs<400HU). RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up time was 87.5 months. DM was found in 28% of subjects. The patients 
      with DM showed more severe CaC, lower albumin and higher C-reactive protein serum 
      levels. Serum albumin was correlated with severe CaC (r=-0.45, P=.009). Overall 
      mortality rate reached 58%. Patients with DM also tended to have higher mortality 
      compared to non-diabetic subjects (X(2) 3.51, P=.061) especially those with severe 
      CaC showed higher mortality than those with severe CaC without DM (93% vs.73%, 
      P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CKD and DM have more severe CaC, 
      increased inflammation-malnutrition data and higher mortality compared to those 
      without DM.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 137-142
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1740-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign of 
      severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. Fetuin-A and 
      osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD therapy. However, 
      there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on dialysis. The aim of 
      our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the relationship between VC and 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and independent predictors of VC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. 
      Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient group was 
      compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A plain 
      radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the evaluation of 
      VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both patients and controls 
      were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients 
      were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly 
      lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly 
      higher in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were 
      independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the following 
      factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was 
      found between patients with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, 
      and 25-OH-vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients 
      undergoing HD and is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the 
      presence of DM, and high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients 
      undergoing HD. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying 
      and the factors contributing to VC.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and the Risk of Cardiovascular and All-Cause 
      Mortality in the General Population: The PREVEND Study.
PG  - 1942-1951
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314187 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification contributes to the cause of cardiovascular 
      disease. The calciprotein particle maturation time (T(50)) in serum, a measure of 
      calcification propensity, has been linked with adverse outcomes in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, but its role in the general population is unclear. We 
      investigated whether serum T(50) is associated with cardiovascular mortality in a 
      large general population-based cohort. Approach and Results: The relationship 
      between serum T(50) and cardiovascular mortality was studied in 6231 participants of 
      the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease) cohort. All-cause 
      mortality was the secondary outcome. Mean (±SD) age was 53±12 years, 50% were male, 
      and mean serum T(50) was 329±58 minutes. A shorter serum T(50) is indicative of a 
      higher calcification propensity. Serum T(50) was inversely associated with 
      circulating phosphate, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and alcohol 
      consumption, whereas plasma magnesium was positively associated with serum T(50) 
      (P<0.001, total multivariable model R(2)=0.281). During median (interquartile range) 
      follow-up for 8.3 (7.8-8.9) years, 364 patients died (5.8%), of whom 95 (26.1%) died 
      from a cardiovascular cause. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, each 
      60 minutes decrease in serum T(50) was independently associated with a higher risk 
      of cardiovascular mortality (fully adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.22 [1.04-1.36], 
      P=0.021). This association was modified by diabetes mellitus; stratified analysis 
      indicated a more pronounced association in individuals with diabetes mellitus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum T(50) is independently associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality in the general population and thus may be an early and 
      potentially modifiable risk marker for cardiovascular mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common and may affect cardiac function in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about the 
      effect of residual renal function on vascular calcification and cardiac function in 
      patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: This study was conducted between January 2014 and 
      January 2017. One hundred six patients with residual renal function on maintenance 
      hemodialysis for 3 months were recruited. We used residual renal urea clearance 
      (KRU) to measure residual renal function. First, abdominal aortic calcification 
      score (AACS) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Second, we performed echocardiography and investigated new 
      cardiovascular events after study enrollment. RESULTS: The median KRU was 0.9 
      (0.3-2.5) mL/min/1.73m2. AACS (4.0 [1.0-10.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0-8.0], p = 0.05) and baPWV 
      (1836.1 ± 250.4 vs. 1676.8 ± 311.0 cm/s, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in 
      patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2. Log-KRU 
      significantly negatively correlated with log-AACS (ß = -0.29, p = 0.002) and baPWV 
      (ß = -0.19, P = 0.05) after factor adjustment. The proportion of left ventricular 
      diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 
      mL/min/1.73m2 than with a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (67.9% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.05). 
      Patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 showed a higher tendency of cumulative 
      cardiovascular events compared to those with a KRU ≥ 0.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (P = 0.08). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Residual renal function was significantly associated with vascular 
      calcification and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

PG  - 635-9
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2015.1010416 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral cholecalciferol 
      treatment on vascular calcification, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and other 
      cardiac functions in dialysis patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: A six-month course of 
      oral cholecalciferol treatment was recommended to dialysis patients with vitamin D 
      insufficiency. While 26 patients were given cholecalciferol treatment, 17 patients 
      who could not tolerate to therapy received standard therapy. Initial biochemical 
      parameters were measured, and they were measured again after 6 months of treatment. 
      Echocardiographic measurements were also performed, and the vascular calcification 
      score (VCS) was calculated at baseline and at the 6th month. RESULTS: The 
      cholecalciferol replacement group showed no significant change in LVMI and VCS 
      values (p > 0.05). However, while LVMI was similar between groups at initial 
      evaluation, it was lower in the cholecalciferol group at the 6th month when compared 
      to the standard treatment group (141.8 ± 40.2 g/m(2) vs. 166.3 ± 31.4 g/m(2); 
      p = 0.04). Likewise, left ventricular diastolic diameters (48.8 ± 5.1 mm vs. 
      47.5 ± 4.6 mm; p = 0.023) and left atrial diameters (41.2 ± 8.9 mm vs. 
      38.9 ± 8.1 mm; p = 0.006) decreased in the cholecalciferol group. Additionally, 
      significant increases were observed in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 
      albumin levels, with a significant decrease in serum C-reactive protein levels. 
      CONCLUSION: A lesser increase in left ventricular mass and better diastolic 
      functions was observed in dialysis patients after 6 months of cholecalciferol 
      treatment.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for vascular calcification in Chinese patients receiving

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With limited data available on calcification prevalence in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients on dialysis, the China Dialysis Calcification Study (CDCS) 
      determined the prevalence of vascular/valvular calcification (VC) and association of 
      risk factors in Chinese patients with prevalent hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). METHODS: CKD patients undergoing HD/PD for ≥6 months were enrolled. 
      Prevalence data for calcification and medical history were documented at baseline. 
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed by electron beam or multi-slice 
      computed tomography (EBCT/MSCT), abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) by lateral 
      lumbar radiography, and cardiac valvular calcification (ValvC) by echocardiography. 
      Serum phosphorus, calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D and FGF-23 were evaluated. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the 
      association between risk factors and VC. RESULTS: Of 1,497 patients, 1,493 (78.3% 
      HD, 21.7% PD) had ≥1 baseline calcification image (final analysis cohort, FAC) and 
      1,423 (78.8% HD, 21.2% PD) had baseline calcification data complete (BCDC). 
      Prevalence of VC was 77.4% in FAC (80.8% HD, 65.1% PD, p < .001) and 77.5% in BCDC 
      (80.7% HD, 65.8% PD). The proportion of BCDC patients with single-site calcification 
      were 20% for CAC, 4.3% for AAC, and 4.3% for cardiac valvular calcification (ValvC), 
      respectively. Double site calcifications were 23.4% for CAC and AAC, 6.5% for CAC 
      and ValvC, and 1.1% for AAC and ValvC, respectively. In total, 17.9% patients had 
      calcification at all three sites. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of total VC in 
      Chinese CKD patients will supplement current knowledge, which is mostly limited, 
      contributing in creating awareness and optimizing VC management.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis in the 
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 571-580
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.261329 [doi]
AB  - The study aimed to provide a unique nationwide data and a valuable update on the 
      current situation of vascular calcification (VC) among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study included all patients diagnosed 
      with CKD over a period of one year and six months from September 2015 to February 
      2017 and underwent dialysis. All analyses were done using IBM-SPSS. Of the 842 
      enrolled patients, 836 (99.3%) constituted the descriptive population. The mean age 
      of patients was 51.8 ± 15.4 years. A total of 759 (90.8%) patients had 
      cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of VC in patients with CKD is 40.8%. In 
      the multivariate analysis, prognostic factors for VC were physical inactivity with 
      odd ratio 2.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): (1.89-4.63), P < 0.01], history of 
      ischemic heart disease 2.34 [95% CI: (1.30-4.22), P < 0.01], dyslipidemia 1.56 [95% 
      CI: (1.01-2.40), P = 0.04], and older age 1.06 [95% CI: (1.05-1.07), P <0.01]. At 
      inclusion, the mean ± standard deviation for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
      low cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides was 41 ± 30, 79.7 ± 29.9, 
      144.2 ± 38.5, and 143.4 ± 95.3 mg/dL, respectively. This study reports useful 
      information about the prevalence of VCs in CKD stage 5D in a Middle Eastern country 
      as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, it offers information on the predictors 
      or associated factors of a VC in CKD patients.

TI  - Incremental effects of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in medial 
      arterial calcification: Synergistic pathways for peripheral artery disease 
      progression.
PG  - 383-394
LID - 10.1177/1358863X19842276 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) separately are known to 
      facilitate the progression of medial arterial calcification (MAC) in patients with 
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD), but their combined effect on MAC and 
      associated mediators of calcification is not well studied. The association of MAC 
      and calcification inducer bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and inhibitor fetuin-A, 
      with PAD, is well known. Our aim was to investigate the association of MAC with 
      alterations in BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein expression in patients with PAD with DM 
      and/or CKD. Peripheral artery plaques (50) collected during directional atherectomy 
      from symptomatic patients with PAD were evaluated, grouped into no-DM/no-CKD (n = 
      14), DM alone (n = 10), CKD alone (n = 12), and DM+CKD (n = 14). MAC density was 
      evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, and alizarin red stain. Analysis of 
      inflammation, neovascularization, BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein density was performed 
      by immunohistochemistry. MAC density, inflammation grade and neovessel content were 
      significantly higher in DM+CKD versus no-DM/no-CKD and CKD (p < 0.01). BMP-2 protein 
      density was significantly higher in DM+CKD versus all other groups (p < 0.01), 
      whereas fetuin-A protein density was significantly lower in DM+CKD versus all other 
      groups (p < 0.001). The combined presence of DM+CKD may be associated with MAC 
      severity in PAD plaques more so than DM or CKD alone, as illustrated in this study, 
      where levels of calcification mediators BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein were related most 
      robustly to DM+CKD. Further understanding of mechanisms involved in mediating 
      calcification and their association with DM and CKD may be useful in improving 
      management and developing therapeutic interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the interaction between serum alkaline 
      phosphatase (ALP) and vascular calcification (VC) affecting cardiovascular events 
      (CVE) and mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. This study 
      investigated the combined effect of ALP and VC on prognosis in ESKD patients 
      starting dialysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 587 ESKD patients treated at a 
      single center between January 2006 and July 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. VC 
      was assessed by the aortic calcification index (ACI) using abdominal computed 
      tomography. Patients were stratified into four groups according to the median ACI 
      (17.18) and serum ALP value (108.0 U/L) as low ACI-low ALP, low ACI-high ALP, high 
      ACI-low ALP, or high ACI-high ALP. The association between ALP and VC and the 
      composite of CVE and death was analyzed. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years 
      (range, 1.5-5.6 years), 140 patients (23.8%) developed CVE and 130 deaths (22.1%) 
      occurred. In the stratified analysis, patients with high ACI-low ALP had a greater 
      risk of the composite endpoint than patients with low ACI-low ALP (adjusted hazard 
      ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-2.60; P = 0.004). Patients with high 
      ACI-high ALP had the greatest risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.77-2.72; P = 0.001). The interaction between ACI and ALP on CVE and 
      mortality was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combined effect 
      of VC and higher ALP was associated with a greater risk of CVE and death, and high 
      serum ALP amplified the risk associated with VC in ESKD patients starting dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both cardiovascular calcification and autonomic dysfunction are 
      frequently encountered in hemodialysis patients. We aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between cardiovascular calcification and heart rate variability (HRV) 
      and their influence on long-term outcome. METHODS: Seventy-eight hemodialysis 
      patients underwent echocardiogram and radiography of the pelvis and hands to 
      identify valvular and vascular calcification. HRV was evaluated using a commercial 
      machine. RESULTS: Based on the average, the patients were divided into higher and 
      lower subgroups of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) respectively. Patients 
      with higher LF were younger and were found to have a lower proportion of diabetes. 
      Their hemoglobin, albumin, and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7 levels were 
      significantly higher and both high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and 
      osteoprotegerin levels were lower (all p < 0.05). In patients of the higher HF 
      group, the proportion of diabetes was lower but they were found to have higher 
      levels of BMP-7 and lower levels of hs-CRP, interleukin-6 (all p < 0.05). 
      Significantly higher LF and HF were noted in patients without vascular 
      calcification, but only hand artery (HA) calcification was negatively correlated 
      with both LF and HF in multivariate analysis. Low LF and high hs-CRP were the 
      independent predictors of mortality. Coexistence of low LF band and HA calcification 
      was associated with the worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal autonomic nervous 
      function was closely related to inflammation and mortality in hemodialysis patients. 
      Calcification of HA was associated with autonomic dysfunction and patients with 
      lower autonomic tone and HA calcification had the highest mortality rate in this 
      population.

TI  - Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification have a 
      large hydrodynamic radius of secondary calciprotein particles.
PG  - 992-1000
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The size of secondary calciprotein particles (CPP2) and the speed of 
      transformation (T50) from primary calciprotein particles (CPP1) to CPP2 in serum may 
      be associated with vascular calcification (VC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). METHODS: We developed a high throughput, microplate-based assay using 
      dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure the transformation of CPP1 to CPP2, 
      hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of CPP1 and CPP2, T50 and aggregation of CPP2. We used this 
      DLS assay to test the hypothesis that a large Rh of CPP2 and/or a fast T50 are 
      associated with VC in 45 participants with CKD Stages 4-5 (22 without VC and 23 with 
      VC) and 17 healthy volunteers (HV). VC was defined as a Kauppila score >6 or an 
      Adragao score ≥3. RESULTS: CKD participants with VC had larger cumulants Rh of CPP2 
      {370 nm [interquartile range (IQR) 272-566]} compared with CKD participants without 
      VC [212 nm (IQR 169-315)] and compared with HV [168 nm (IQR 145-352), P < 0.01 for 
      each]. More CPP2 were in aggregates in CKD participants with VC than those without 
      VC (70% versus 36%). The odds of having VC increased by 9% with every 10 nm increase 
      in the Rh of CPP2, after adjusting for age, diabetes, serum calcium and phosphate 
      [odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.16, P = 0.005]. The area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve for VC of CPP2 size was 0.75 (95% 
      CI 0.60, 0.90). T50 was similar in CKD participants with and without VC, although 
      both groups had a lower T50 than HV. CONCLUSIONS: Rh of CPP2, but not T50, is 
      independently associated with VC in patients with CKD Stages 4-5.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated associations of serum matrix Gla protein (MGP), 
      plasma vitamin K1, and plasma vitamin K2 with coronary artery calcium score (CACS) 
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. 
      Methods: Subjects comprised 112 MHD patients aged 30-60 years and 40 age-matched 
      healthy subjects. Total MGP, vitamin K1, vitamin K2, and lipid profile were examined 
      in all subjects; other clinical data, medication use, and CACS were assessed only in 
      MHD patients. Determinants of MGP in all subjects were identified by regression 
      analysis. Factors associated with CACS and CVD in MHD patients were identified by 
      regression analysis and logistic analysis, respectively. Results: Lower plasma 
      levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides [0.39 (0.24-0.70) vs. 0.77 
      (0.48-1.34) ng/mg, p < 0.001], higher frequency of plasma vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml 
      (p = 0.23), and higher serum total MGP (288.4 ± 44.2 vs. 159.7 ± 40.6 ng/ml, 
      p < 0.0001) were observed in MHD patients than in healthy controls. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides 
      (p <0 .001) and vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml (p < 0.05) in all subjects. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with presence of CVD (p <0 .05), but not CACS, in MHD 
      patients. Conclusion: The end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis is a deficiency 
      state of vitamin K. Total MGP was significantly higher in MHD patients compared to 
      healthy subjects and total MGP was associated with the presence of CVD, but not 
      CACS, in MHD patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death 
      mainly due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Early risk identification may allow 
      interventions and prevention of fatal events. OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to 
      assess the usefulness of selected CVD biomarkers as predictors of 5-year mortality 
      in patients with different CKD stages. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study included 57 CKD 
      patients: 38 in stage 5 (ESRD), 19 in stage 3 and 4 (CKD3-4), and 19 healthy 
      controls. Blood samples were obtained once to measure fetuin A, adiponectin, leptin, 
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), 
      intracellular-1 (ICAM1) and vascular-1 (VCAM1) adhesion molecules (ELISA or Luminex 
      platform). Computed tomography was performed to assess the calcium score (CS). 
      Patients were prospectively followed for 5 years to evaluate their all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: Serum VCAM1, TNF and IL-6 were significantly higher in more 
      advanced CKD stages. VCAM1 correlated significantly with ICAM1, TNF and IL-6. TNF 
      and IL-6 were also significantly correlated with each other. No significant changes 
      were detected for other markers. IL-6 correlated significantly with CS, age, renal 
      function and CRP. Elevated CS and IL-6 increased over 3 times the 5-year all-cause 
      and cardiovascular mortality risks in patients with CKD or ESRD at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and CS were significantly associated with 5-year risk of all-cause 
      mortality in CKD patients. Our study suggests an involvement of chronic inflammation 
      linked to coronary artery calcification that is likely to contribute to the 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with impaired renal function.

TI  - Study on the Prevalence of Vascular Calcification in Different Types of Arteries and 
      Influencing Factors in Maintenance Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 8-16
LID - 10.1159/000496218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of vascular calcification (VC) in different 
      types of arteries in patients with maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 
      its influencing factors. METHODS: This study enrolled PD patients with stable status 
      who has received PD treatment for more than 6 months in Peking University People's 
      Hospital. We used plain X-ray films of abdomen, pelvis, and hands to quantitatively 
      evaluate VC of large artery (abdominal aorta, iliac artery), medium artery (femoral 
      artery, radial artery), and small artery (finger arteries). Two radiologists read 
      and scored radiographs blindly. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, Charlson 
      comorbidity index (CCI), baseline and time-average laboratory indices including 
      parameters of calcium phosphorus metabolism, serum albumin, PD adequacy were 
      collected. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the influencing factors 
      of different sites of VC. RESULTS: (1) 154 PD patients were enrolled in this study: 
      seventy-eight males, mean age was 60.4 ± 13.9 years, and median PD duration was 24 
      (16.39) months. The major primary disease was diabetic nephropathy (39%). (2) Among 
      the 154 PD patients, the proportion of calcification of large artery was the highest 
      (found in 100 patients, accounting for 64.9%); then the medium artery (66, 42.9%); 
      and 15 of small artery, accounting for 9.7%. (3) Logistic regression showed that 
      older age, longer dialysis duration, lower baseline serum intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH), and higher CCI scores were independent risk factors of large artery 
      calcification (p < 0.05), and higher CCI scores, higher baseline serum triglycerides 
      (TG), lower baseline serum iPTH, and time-average iPTH were independent risk factors 
      of medium and small arteries. CONCLUSIONS: In PD patients, the occurrence of large 
      artery calcification was higher than others. Among different sites of VC, the 
      abdominal aortic calcification was most likely to occur, and the proportion of small 
      artery calcification was low. Calcification of medium and small arteries can exist 
      alone without calcification of large artery. Large artery calcification was more 
      likely to occur in patients with older age, longer dialysis duration, lower baseline 
      serum iPTH levels and higher CCI scores. Patients with higher CCI scores, higher 
      baseline TG and lower baseline iPTH, and time-average iPTH were more likely to 
      develop small and medium artery calcification.

TI  - Calciphylaxis-Associated Cutaneous Vascular Calcification in Noncalciphylaxis 
      Patients.
PG  - 557-563
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000001519 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a highly morbid disease that is strongly associated with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD); however, the histologic criteria for diagnosis have not been 
      well established nor have their specificity for calciphylaxis been determined. This 
      retrospective study aimed to examine the prevalence of histologic features commonly 
      associated with calciphylaxis in noncalciphylaxis patients. We also sought to 
      evaluate whether these features may be more prevalent in patients with CKD. To 
      assess this, healthy marginal skin tissue from above-the-knee amputation specimens 
      was compared between patients with CKD (n = 23) and without CKD (n = 47). 
      Intravascular calcification of capillaries or small-to-medium arterioles was 
      detected on von Kossa stain in 40.0% of the entire cohort. Capillary calcification 
      and intravascular thrombosis were more prevalent in patients with CKD. Finely 
      stippled capillary calcification was present in 26.1% of patients with CKD versus 
      8.5% of patients without CKD (P = 0.0484), and intravascular thrombosis was present 
      in 8.7% of patients with CKD and 0.0% of patients without CKD (P = 0.0403). None of 
      the patients in this study had clinical evidence of calciphylaxis at presentation 
      and in at least a 1-year follow-up period. This study confirms that the histologic 
      features previously associated with calciphylaxis are nonspecific and are more 
      prevalent in patients with CKD.

TI  - Plasma pyrophosphate and vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 187-91
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp362 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyrophosphate (PPi) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification and 
      may be deficient in renal failure. We sought to determine whether plasma PPi is 
      affected by dialysis or the mode of dialysis and whether it correlates with vascular 
      calcification. METHODS: PPi was measured in plasma samples stored from a recent 
      study of vascular calcification in 54 HD patients, 23 peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients and 38 patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Calcification 
      was quantified in a standardized section of the superficial femoral artery using 
      computed tomography, and PPi was measured by enzyme assay, at both baseline and 1 
      year. RESULTS: Baseline plasma PPi was weakly correlated with age and serum 
      phosphate, but not with alkaline phosphatase activity or other biochemical 
      parameters, and did not differ between HD, PD and CKD patients. Both baseline 
      calcification score and change in the calcification score at 1 year decreased with 
      increasing quartiles of plasma PPi. In a multivariate analysis, plasma PPi was 
      independently correlated with baseline calcification (P = 0.039) and the change in 
      calcification (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Plasma PPi is negatively associated with 
      vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CKD but is not affected 
      by dialysis, the mode of dialysis or nutritional or inflammatory status. Although 
      these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of PPi on vascular 
      calcification, further studies are needed to establish a causal role.

      hemodialysis patients: A retrospective study.
PG  - 755-763
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.265449 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the presence of 
      carotid artery calcification (CAC) and pulp stone (PS). A total of 60 chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients (30 CAC positive, 30 CAC negative) participated in this 
      study. The mean age of patients was 54.7 ± 16.4 years, and 32 (53%) of them were 
      male. CAC was defined as the presence of heterogeneous nodular opacities in the soft 
      tissue in C3-C4 intervertebral area. Panoramic radiographs of the patients were 
      evaluated for CAC and PS by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. PS was 
      evaluated in all healthy, decayed, and restored teeth except the third molar teeth, 
      in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. The Statistical Package for the Social 
      Sciences (version 20.0; SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. A 
      probability P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The prevalence of PS 
      in this study was 30% (18 patients) all group. A total of 1324 teeth were analyzed 
      and PS was detected in 237 teeth (17.9%). The occurrence of PS in teeth in 
      CAC-positive group (10 patients, 17.2% of 654 teeth) was similar to that in 
      CAC-negative group (8 patient, 18.3% of 670 teeth). There was no statistical 
      correlation between CAC and PS in chronic HD patients (P = 0.08). In the subgroup 
      analysis, the presence of diabetes (P = 0.003), parathormone level (P = 0.02), 
      calcium × phosphorus product (P = 0.04), and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002) 
      were higher, and duration of HD (P = 0.03) was significantly longer in patients with 
      CAC-positive and PS. In chronic HD patients, the presence of PS was not a strong 
      predictor for the presence of CAC.

AB  - Patients who undergo hemodialysis often suffer from cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
      and evaluation of coronary artery calcification is extremely important. These 
      evaluations are typically conducted using a noninvasive method including electron 
      beam computed tomography (CT) or multi-detector CT, and the Agatston method to 
      calculate the coronary artery calcification score (CACS). However, it is difficult 
      to use for patients undergoing dialysis. Because patients undergoing dialysis is too 
      strong in coronary artery calcification, and results become incorrect. Therefore, we 
      were looking for a calcified evaluation place peculiar to a patients undergoing 
      dialysis. We obtained pelvic artery calcification scores (PACS) using a 64-row 
      multi-slice CT to assess the presence of calcification within a triangular space 
      bordered by bordered by osseous structure. We used the Agatston method to calculate 
      PACS. We compared male patients undergoing dialysis with male patients with normal 
      renal function. Patients undergoing hemodialysis had a significantly higher 
      incidence of pelvic artery calcification than normal controls (79.7% vs. 5.5%). In 
      the dialysis group, CACS was 1660.2 (0-9056.1), and PACS was 48.8 (0-2943.1). We 
      found a correlation between PACS and CACS and between PACS and dialysis period. We 
      found penile artery calcification in male patients undergoing hemodialysis was more 
      than normal controls, and it was possible to quantify PACS using the Agatston 
      method. This study suggested the possibility that PACS became the vascular 
      calcification evaluation method of the hemodialysis patient.

LID - 10.1536/ihj.20-126 [doi]
AB  - Bleeding complication has been considered as a serious problem in current 
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Fortunately, several groups have already 
      reported the effectiveness of protamine use just after PCI to immediately remove any 
      arterial sheath. However, there is a concern that protamine reversal may increase 
      non-occlusive thrombus and, in turn, lead to mid-term cardiovascular events such as 
      target vessel revascularization (TVR) or stent thrombosis. Thus, the purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate whether protamine use following elective PCI was associated 
      with mid-term clinical outcomes. In total, 472 patients were included in this study; 
      subsequently, they were divided into protamine group (n = 142) and non-protamine 
      group (n = 330). The primary endpoint was the composite of ischemia-driven TVR and 
      stent thrombosis. The median follow-up period was determined to be at 562 days. In 
      total, 32 primary endpoints were observed during the study period, and the incidence 
      of primary endpoints tended to be greater in the protamine group than in the 
      non-protamine group (P = 0.056). However, the lesion length, the degree of 
      calcification, and the prevalence of hemodialysis were significantly determined 
      greater in the protamine group than in the non-protamine group. In the multivariate 
      Cox proportional hazards model, the use of protamine (versus non-protamine: hazard 
      ratio 0.542 and 95% confidence interval 0.217-1.355, P = 0.191) was deemed not to be 
      associated with the primary endpoint after controlling legion length, calcification, 
      and hemodialysis. In conclusion, immediate protamine use following elective PCI did 
      not increase mid-term ischemia-driven TVR or stent thrombosis. However, immediate 
      protamine use after PCI should be discussed further for the safety of the patient.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find a correlation between acute-phase proteins (APPs) 
      and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) as well as the impact APPs on AAC in 
      chronic dialysis patients (CDPs). Native lateral lumbar radiography and biochemical 
      analysis were performed in 112 CDPs (aged 60.0 ± 5.43 years) to estimate and score 
      AAC and biochemical values of APPs. The mean AAC score was 8.39 ± 5.43. We detected 
      16 (14.28%) CDPs without AAC and 96 (85.71%) CDPs with AAC (10 ± 5.43). The number 
      of CDPs with AAC ≤4 was 34 (30.36%) with mean AAC score of 1.85 ± 1.94. By multiple 
      regression analysis, we found positive correlation between AAC and ferritin (β = 
      0.004398, P = 0.0085) and AAC and C-reactive protein [(CRP), β = 0.1972, P = 
      0.0178]. Sensitivity/specificity pairs and criterion variables (CrVs) were as 
      follows: for CRP: 44.21%, 100%, and CrV ≥6 and for ferritin: 83.16%, 56.25%, and CrV 
      ≥196.32. The area under curve (AUC) for CRP and ferritin was 0.721 (P <0.0001) and 
      0.730 (P <0.0026), respectively. Fibrinogen and serum iron AUC in the prediction of 
      AAC were 0.533 (P = 0.5749) and 0.618 (P = 0.0795), respectively. CRP and ferritin 
      were the most powerful APPs involved in the promotion of AAC; serum iron and 
      fibrinogen were shown as lower activity promoters in CDPs. Serum albumin showed 
      inverse activity on AAC.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous 
      pancreas-kidney transplantation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/nep.12212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD 
      artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients 
      undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD. METHODS: Laboratory testing 
      was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) 
      transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral 
      abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale. 
      RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their 
      median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months 
      (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with 
      the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence 
      of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate 
      analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer 
      dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). 
      In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, 
      presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, 
      and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. CONCLUSION: VC 
      is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older 
      patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. 
      However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association 
      of VC to BMD.

TI  - Matrix Gla protein is an independent predictor of both intimal and medial vascular

PG  - 6586
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-63013-8 [doi]
LID - 6586
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification (VC) and 
      requires carboxylation by vitamin K to exert calcification inhibition. Chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients undergo early vascular aging often involving extensive 
      VC. The present cross-sectional study investigated the association between 
      circulating dp-ucMGP levels, MGP expression in vascular tissue and MGP 
      polymorphisms. In 141 CKD stage 5 patients, CAC score was significantly increased in 
      the highest tertile of dp-ucMGP (p = 0.002), and a high medial VC score was 
      associated with elevated dp-ucMGP levels. MGP vascular expression was associated 
      with increased circulating dp-ucMGP and CAC scores. MGP SNP analysis revealed that 
      patients homozygous for the C allele of the rs1800801 variant had a higher CAC score 
      (median 15 [range 0-1312]) compared to patients carrying a T allele (median 0 [range 
      0-966] AU). These results indicate that plasma levels of dp-ucMGP are an independent 
      predictor of increased VC in CKD5 patients and correlate with both higher CAC scores 
      and degree of medial calcification. Additionally, high vascular expression of MGP 
      was associated with higher CAC scores and plasma dp-ucMGP levels. Taken together, 
      our results support that MGP is involved in the pathogenesis of VC.

TI  - Chronic Kidney Disease Circulating Calciprotein Particles and Extracellular Vesicles 
      Promote Vascular Calcification: A Role for GRP (Gla-Rich Protein).
PG  - 575-587

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of mineral crystal formation is a crucial step in ectopic 
      calcification. Serum calciprotein particles (CPPs) have been linked to chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) calcification propensity, but additional knowledge is required 
      to understand their function, assemblage, and composition. The role of other 
      circulating nanostructures, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vascular 
      calcification is currently unknown. Here, we investigated the association of GRP 
      (Gla-rich protein) with circulating CPP and EVs and the role of CKD CPPs and EVs in 
      vascular calcification. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Biological CPPs and EVs were isolated 
      from healthy and CKD patients and comparatively characterized using ultrastructural, 
      analytic, molecular, and immuno-based techniques. Our results show that GRP is a 
      constitutive component of circulating CPPs and EVs. CKD stage 5 serum CPPs and EVs 
      are characterized by lower levels of fetuin-A and GRP, and CPPs CKD stage 5 have 
      increased mineral maturation, resembling secondary CPP particles. Vascular smooth 
      muscle cell calcification assays reveal that CPPs CKD stage 5 and EVs CKD stage 5 
      are taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells and induce vascular calcification by 
      promoting cell osteochondrogenic differentiation and inflammation. These effects 
      were rescued by incubation of CPPs CKD stage 5 with γ-carboxylated GRP. In vitro, 
      formation and maturation of basic calcium phosphate crystals was highly reduced in 
      the presence of γ-carboxylated GRP, fetuin-A, and MGP (matrix gla protein), and a 
      similar antimineralization system was identified in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Uremic CPPs 
      and EVs are important players in the mechanisms of widespread calcification in CKD. 
      We propose a major role for cGRP as inhibitory factor to prevent calcification at 
      systemic and tissue levels.

LID - 10.2215/CJN.05450513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among patients undergoing dialysis and 
      is associated with mortality. Factors such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin 
      (OPN), bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7), and fetuin-A are involved in vascular 
      calcification. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: OPG, OPN, BMP-7, and 
      fetuin-A were measured in blood samples from 602 incident dialysis patients 
      recruited from United States dialysis centers between 1995 and 1998 as part of the 
      Choices for Healthy Outcomes In Caring for ESRD Study. Their association with 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards 
      models adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidity, serum phosphate, and 
      calcium. An interaction with diabetes was tested because of its known association 
      with vascular calcification. Predictive accuracy of selected biomarkers was explored 
      by C-statistics in nested models with training and validation subcohorts. RESULTS: 
      Higher OPG and lower fetuin-A levels were associated with higher mortality over up 
      to 13 years of follow-up (median, 3.4 years). The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for 
      highest versus lowest tertile were 1.49 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.08 to 
      2.06) for OPG and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.92) for fetuin-A. In stratified models, 
      the highest tertile of OPG was associated with higher mortality among patients 
      without diabetes (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.35 to 4.34), but not patients with diabetes 
      (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.93; P for interaction=0.001). In terms of 
      cardiovascular mortality, higher fetuin-A was associated with lower risk (HR, 0.85 
      per 0.1 g/L: 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96). In patients without diabetes, higher OPG was 
      associated with greater risk (HR for highest versus lowest tertile, 2.91; 95% CI, 
      1.06 to 7.99), but not in patients with diabetes or overall. OPN and BMP-7 were not 
      independently associated with outcomes overall. The addition of OPG and fetuin-A did 
      not significantly improve predictive accuracy of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: OPG and 
      fetuin-A may be risk factors for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients 
      undergoing dialysis, but do not improve risk prediction.

TI  - Serum osteoprotegerin is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness as 
      assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients: a cross

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link 
      between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD 
      patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured 
      using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define 
      the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into 
      tertiles. RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high 
      arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure 
      (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
      (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV 
      value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing 
      tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, 
      respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum 
      calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; 
      OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with 
      cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). 
      CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have 
      greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit higher 
      prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CaC) than general population. CaC has 
      been proposed as a risk factor for mortality in end-stage CKD, but most studies in 
      the field are based on short-term follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a cohort, 10-year 
      prospective longitudinal study of consecutive cases referred to the renal unit. A 
      non-enhanced multislice coronary computed tomography was performed at baseline. CaC 
      was assessed by Agatston method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC 
      score: severe calcification group (CaCs< 400 HU) and mild-moderate calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400 HU). The overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, CV events, and 
      factors potentially associated with CaC development were recorded. RESULTS: 137 
      patients with advanced CKD were enrolled and provided consent. Overall mortality 
      rate was 58%; 40% due to CV events. The rate of overall mortality in the severe 
      calcification group was 75%, and 30% in the low calcification group, whereas the 
      rate of CV mortality was 35% vs. 6%, respectively (p < 0.001). The severe 
      calcification group was older, had higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      former cardiologic events, and lower albumin serum levels than the mild-moderate 
      calcification group. In a multivariate Cox model, severe CaC was a significant 
      predictor of CV mortality (HR 5.01; 95%CI 1.28 to 19.6, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Among advanced CKD, there was a significantly increase of CV mortality in patients 
      with severe CaCs during a 10-year follow-up period. CaCs could be a useful 
      prognostic tool to predict CV mortality risk in CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) and atherosclerosis are associated 
      with an increased cardiovascular morbimortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN) are involved in both VC and CKD. Soluble 
      tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) has been related to 
      cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that OPG, OPN and sTWEAK levels may be 
      associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. 
      METHODS: The presence of calcified or non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques was 
      assessed in 1043 stage 3 to 5D CKD patients from The NEFRONA Study. Biochemical 
      measurements and OPG, OPN and sTWEAK serum levels were analyzed. Patients were 
      followed for cardiovascular outcomes (41 ± 16 months). RESULTS: At recruitment, 26% 
      of CKD patients had VC. The adjusted odds ratios for having VC were 2.22 
      (1.32-3.75); p=.003 for OPG, and 0.45 (0.24-0.84); p=.01 for sTWEAK concentrations. 
      After follow-up, 95 CV events occurred. In a Cox model, patients with OPG or OPN 
      above and sTWEAK below their optimal cut-off points had an adjusted higher risk of 
      cardiovascular events [HR: 2.10 (1.49-3.90); p=.02; 1.65 (1.02-2.65); p=.04; 2.05 
      (1.28-3.29), p=.003; respectively]. When CKD patients were grouped according to the 
      number of biomarkers above (OPG and OPN) or below (sTWEAK) their cut-off points, the 
      combination of these biomarkers showed the highest risk for cardiovascular events 
      [HR: 9.46 (3.80-23.5) p < .001]. A composite score of these three biomarkers 
      increased the C-statistic and net reclassification index beyond conventional risk 
      factors and VC. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of OPG, OPN and sTWEAK increased the 
      predictability of cardiovascular outcomes.

TI  - Chimney-Patch Arterial Graft in Kidney or Pancreas Transplantation for Recipients 
      with Heavily Calcified Iliac Arteries.
PG  - 70-74
LID - 10.12659/AOT.912744 [doi]
AB  - Iliac artery calcification is a common phenomenon complicating renal 
      transplantation, particularly in those with diabetes. The potential for vascular 
      clamp injury can threaten the renal allograft, ipsilateral lower extremity, or both. 
      Utilization of internal balloon occlusion can allow for placement of a "Chimney 
      Patch" graft, fashioned from a deceased donor artery, to the calcified vessel, 
      eliminating the risk of clamp injury and minimizing warm ischemic time. We present a 
      series of 6 patients transplanted with internal balloon occlusion with successful 
      renal and pancreatic allograft function and no ipsilateral vascular complications. 
      Internal balloon occlusion is a safe and effective adjunct for renal or pancreas 
      transplant to prevent clamp injury with no adverse effect on allograft function.

TI  - Sparing effect of peritoneal dialysis vs hemodialysis on BMD changes and its impact

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bone loss in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients associates with 
      fractures, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased 
      mortality. We investigated factors associated with changes of bone mineral density 
      (ΔBMD) during the initial year on dialysis therapy and associations of ΔBMD with 
      subsequent mortality in ESRD patients initiating dialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      242 ESRD patients (median age 55 years, 61% men) starting dialysis with peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD; n = 138) or hemodialysis (HD; n = 104), whole-body dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), body composition, nutritional status and circulating 
      biomarkers were assessed at baseline and 1 year after dialysis start. We used 
      multivariate linear regression analysis to determine factors associated with ΔBMD, 
      and fine and gray competing risk analysis to determine associations of ΔBMD with 
      subsequent mortality risk. RESULTS: BMD decreased significantly in HD patients 
      (significant reductions of BMD(total) and BMD(leg, trunk, rib, pelvis and spine)) 
      but not in PD patients. HD compared to PD therapy associated with negative changes 
      in BMD(total (β=- 0.15)), BMD(head (β=- 0.14)), BMD(leg (β=- 0.18)) and BMD(trunk 
      (β=- 0.16)). Better preservation of BMD associated with significantly lower 
      all-cause mortality for ΔBMD(total) (sub-hazard ratio, sHR, 0.91), ΔBMD(head) (sHR 
      0.91) and ΔBMD(leg) (sHR 0.92), while only ΔBMD(head) (sHR 0.92) had a beneficial 
      effect on CVD-mortality. CONCLUSIONS: PD had beneficial effect compared with HD on 
      BMD changes during first year of dialysis therapy. Better preservation of BMD, 
      especially in bone sites rich in cortical bone, associated with lower subsequent 
      mortality. BMD in cortical bone may have stronger association with clinical outcome 
      than BMD in trabecular bone.

TI  - Sclerostin Serum Levels and Vascular Calcification Progression in Prevalent Renal 
      Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 4669-76
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-3056 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal 
      transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt 
      signaling contributes to VC. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether 
      circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of 
      VC. DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels 
      Renal Transplant Cohort study. SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care academic 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were 
      measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 
      ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median 
      follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored 
      blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of 
      baseline VC and progression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was 
      progression of VC. RESULTS: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. 
      Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson 
      criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association 
      between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse 
      after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level 
      was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta 
      calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin 
      levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment 
      for traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sclerostin levels inversely 
      associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for 
      traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted 
      chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be 
      up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local 
      counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and 
      experimental data are required for confirmation.

TI  - Citric-acid dialysate improves the calcification propensity of hemodialysis 
      patients: A multicenter prospective randomized cross-over trial.
PG  - e0225824
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225824 [doi]
LID - e0225824
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The concentration of dialysate calcium (dCa) has been suggested to 
      affect vascular calcification, but evidence is scarce. Calcification propensity 
      reflects the intrinsic capacity of serum to prevent calcium and phosphate to 
      precipitate. The use of citric-acid dialysate may have a beneficial effect on the 
      calcification propensity due to the chelating effect on calcium and magnesium. The 
      aim of this study was to compare the intradialytic and short-term effects of 
      haemodialysis with either standard acetic-acid dialysate with dCa1.50 (A1.5) or 
      dCa1.25 (A1.25), as well as citric-acid dialysate with dCa1.50 (C1.5) in bicarbonate 
      dialysis on the calcification propensity of serum. METHODS: Chronic stable 
      hemodialysis patients were included. This multicenter randomized cross-over study 
      consisted out of a baseline week (A1.5), followed by the randomized sequence of 
      A1.25 or C1.5 for one week after which the alternate treatment was provided after a 
      washout week with A1.5. Calcification propensity of serum was assessed by 
      time-resolved nephelometry where the T50 reflects the transition time between 
      formation of primary and secondary calciprotein particles. RESULTS: Eighteen 
      patients (median age 70 years) completed the study. Intradialytic change in T50 was 
      increased with C1.5 (121 [90-152]min) compared to A1.25 (83 [43-108]min, p<0.001) 
      and A1.5 (66 [18-102]min, p<0.001). During the treatment week, predialysis T50 
      increased significantly from the first to the third session with C1.5 (271 [234-291] 
      to 280 [262-339]min, p = 0.002) and with A1.25 (274 [213-308] to 307 [256-337]min, 
      p<0.001), but not with A1.5 (284 [235-346] to 300 [247-335]min, p = 0.33). 
      CONCLUSION: Calcification propensity, as measured by the change in T50, improved 
      significantly during treatment in C1.5 compared to A1.25 and A1.5. Long-term studies 
      are needed to investigate the effects of different dialysate compositions 
      concentrations on vascular calcification and bone mineral disorders.

TI  - Vascular calcifications and renal osteodystrophy in chronic hemodialysis patients: 
      what is the relationship between them?
PG  - 1179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11255-010-9841-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are 
      frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, 
      but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our 
      study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD 
      patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between 
      VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients. METHODS: We 
      examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 
      81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis. RESULTS: We 
      found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC 
      (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear 
      regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum 
      albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment 
      with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations 
      between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D 
      treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. CONCLUSION: There seems 
      to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. 
      Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium 
      salts are risk factors for VCs.

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a well-known complication in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). Keeping in mind, the end goal to assess the genuine effect of 
      mineral bone disease in the pathogenesis of blood vessel calcification during the 
      pre-dialysis course of CKD, we assessed the prevalence and extent of abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) in nondiabetic CKD patients recently starting 
      hemodialysis (HD). Eighty-one patients with end-stage renal disease beginning HD 
      over a one-month period were selected. They underwent a detailed clinical 
      examination and laboratory evaluation, including serum calcium, phosphorus, 
      parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), and alkaline phosphatase 
      were measured, and spiral computed tomography was performed to evaluate AAC score. 
      AAC was present in 64 patients (79%). There was a significant correlation between 
      the AAC score and age (r = 0.609, P <0.001) and FGF-23 (r = 0.800, P <0.001). This 
      study suggests that the prevalence and extent of AAC are critical in incident HD 
      patients. Serum FGF-23 level is the sole statistically significant correlate of AAC 
      in these patients.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification is superior to other arteries calcification in 
      predicting the mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients - a 8 years cohort study.
PG  - 439
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1593-6 [doi]
LID - 439
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a growing concern that abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) has a predictive effect on the prognosis of patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, whether other vascular calcification (VC) 
      can predict the occurrence of adverse events in patients, and whether it is 
      necessary to assess the calcification of other blood vessels remains controversial. 
      This study aimed to assess VC in different sites using X-ray films, and to 
      investigate the predictive effects of VC at different sites on all-cause mortality 
      and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: The 
      data of Radiographs (lateral abdominal plain film, frontal pelvic radiograph and 
      both hands radiograph) were collected to evaluate the calcification of abdominal 
      aorta, iliac artery, femoral artery, radial artery, and finger arteries. Patients' 
      demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory data were recorded. The total 
      follow-up period was 8 years, and the time and cause of death were recorded. 
      Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. COX regression analysis 
      was used to examine independent predictors of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. 
      RESULTS: One hundred fifty PD patients were included, a total of 79 patients (52.7%) 
      died at the end of follow-up. After adjusting variables in the multivariate COX 
      regression analysis, AAC was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in PD 
      patients (HR = 2.089, 95% CI: 1.089-4.042, P = 0.029), and was also an independent 
      predictor of CV mortality (HR = 4.660, 95% CI: 1.852-11.725, P = 0.001). We also 
      found that femoral artery calcification had a predictive effect on all-cause and CV 
      mortality. But the calcification in iliac artery, radial artery, and finger arteries 
      were not independent predictors of patients' all-cause and CV mortality in PD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: AAC was more common in PD patients and was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. The femoral artery calcification 
      also can predict the mortality, but the calcification of iliac artery, radial 
      artery, and finger arteries cannot predict the mortality of PD patients.

TI  - Histopathology of Calciphylaxis: Cohort Study With Clinical Correlations.
PG  - 795-802
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000824 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare, painful, and life-threatening condition with a high 
      mortality rate. Although the etiology of calciphylaxis is not well understood, it 
      has been proposed that calcium deposition within and around subcutaneous vessels 
      restricts blood flow chronically, thereby predisposing the patient to acute 
      pannicular and dermal thrombosis. Given increasing recognition of the role of 
      hypercoagulability in calciphylaxis, this retrospective cohort study sought to 
      evaluate the presence of thromboses and dermal angioplasia in calciphylaxis. 
      Moreover, we aimed to validate previous observations about the histopathology of 
      calciphylaxis compared with skin biopsies from patients with end-stage renal disease 
      but without calciphylaxis. After a meticulous clinical chart review, we assessed the 
      corresponding skin biopsies for the presence of vessel calcification, thromboses, 
      and dermal angioplasia in skin biopsies from patients with calciphylaxis (n = 57) 
      and compared with those from patients with end-stage renal disease but without 
      calciphylaxis (n = 26). Histopathologic findings were correlated with clinical 
      features such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or associated malignancy. Our 
      results validated a prior observation that calciphylaxis was significantly more 
      likely to show calcification of dermal vessels and diffuse dermal thrombi. This 
      study reports the frequent finding of dermal angioplasia, a potential marker of 
      chronic low-grade ischemia, as another frequent microscopic finding in 
      calciphylaxis. Among cases of calciphylaxis, histopathologic changes in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease were indistinguishable from those in patients without 
      chronic kidney disease, thereby implying a final common pathogenic pathway in both 
      uremic and nonuremic calciphylaxis. In future, larger, prospective studies may be 
      useful in validating these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been 
      established as an important marker for cardiovascular morbidity, very few studies 
      have studied it in end-stage renal disease patients. Thus we examined and evaluate 
      risk factors of calcification changes in dialysis patients. METHOD: Among 28 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients, CAC was measured in Agatston units at baseline and after 
      five years using the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT. The HD patients were classified 
      as progressors or no progressors according to the change in the CAC score across 
      these 2 measurements. RESULTS: Over an average 63 months follow-up, participants 
      without CAC at baseline had no incident CAC. The progression of CAC was slow and was 
      found only in 6 patients (21.4%). It was significantly associated with several 
      cardiovascular risk factors, namely, older age (P=0.03), diabetes (P=0.05), male sex 
      (P=0.02), hypercholesterolemia (P=0.05), anemia (P=0.017), inflammation (P=0.05), 
      and hyperphosphataemia (P=0.012). However, calcemia, parathormone levels, dialysis 
      duration, tobacco, high blood pressure and dialysis dose did not seem to influence 
      the progression of CAC in our series. A strong association was found between basal 
      calcification scores and Delta increment at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests 
      that CAC progression in dialysis is a complex phenomenon, associated with several 
      risk factors with special regard to elevated basal scores. This progression can be 
      avoided or slowed with appropriate management, which must begin in the early stages 
      of chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Increased Proteinuria is Associated with Increased Aortic Arch Calcification,

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with high 
      prevalence rates of proteinuria, vascular calcification and cardiomegaly. In this 
      study, we investigated relationships among proteinuria, aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) in patients with CKD stage 3A-5. In addition, 
      we investigated correlations among proteinuria and decline in renal function, 
      overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Methods: We enrolled 482 pre-dialysis 
      patients with CKD stage 3A-5, and determined AoAC and CTR using chest radiography at 
      enrollment. The patients were stratified into four groups according to quartiles of 
      urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (U(PCR)). Results: The patients in quartile 4 had 
      a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope, and higher prevalence 
      rates of rapid renal progression, progression to commencement of dialysis, overall 
      and CV mortality. Multivariable analysis showed that a high U(PCR) was associated 
      with high AoAC (unstandardized coefficient β: 0.315; p = 0.002), high CTR 
      (unstandardized coefficient β: 1.186; p = 0.028) and larger negative eGFR slope 
      (unstandardized coefficient β: -2.398; p < 0.001). With regards to clinical 
      outcomes, a high U(PCR) was significantly correlated with progression to dialysis 
      (log per 1 mg/g; hazard ratio [HR], 2.538; p = 0.003), increased overall mortality 
      (log per 1 mg/g; HR, 2.292; p = 0.003) and increased CV mortality (log per 1 mg/g; 
      HR, 3.195; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Assessing proteinuria may allow for the early 
      identification of high-risk patients and initiate interventions to prevent vascular 
      calcification, cardiomegaly, and poor clinical outcomes.

TI  - Gustatory Function and the Uremic Toxin, Phosphate, Are Modulators of the Risk of 
      Vascular Calcification among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12060420 [doi]
LID - 420
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of vascular 
      calcification (VC), including aortic arch calcification (AAC). Few investigated the 
      influence of gustatory function on the probability of having VC. We examined whether 
      gustatory function results modulated the probability of having VC in patients with 
      CKD. We prospectively enrolled adults with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), with their AAC rated semi-quantitatively and gustatory 
      function assessed by objective and subjective approaches. Multiple logistic 
      regression was used to analyze the relationship between gustatory function results 
      and AAC. Those with AAC had significantly better objective gustatory function in 
      aggregate scores (p = 0.039) and categories (p = 0.022) and less defective bitter 
      taste (p = 0.045) and scores (p = 0.037) than those without. Multiple regression 
      analyses showed that higher aggregate scores (odds ratio (OR) 1.288, p = 0.032), or 
      better gustatory function, and higher bitter taste scores (OR 2.558, p = 0.019) were 
      each associated with a higher probability of having AAC among CKD patients; such an 
      association was modulated by serum phosphate levels. In conclusion, better gustatory 
      function was independently correlated with having AAC among CKD patients. A 
      follow-up of VC severity may be an underrecognized component of care for CKD 
      patients with a preserved gustatory function.

AB  - Inflammation is central to chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis and vascular 
      outcomes, but the exact players remain unidentified. Since low density granulocytes 
      (LDGs) are emerging mediators in inflammatory conditions, we aimed to evaluate 
      whether LDGs may be altered in CKD and related to clinical outcomes as biomarkers. 
      To his end, LDGs subsets were measured in peripheral blood by flow cytometry and 
      confocal microscopy in 33 CKD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 15 healthy 
      controls (HC). Analyses were replicated in an additional cohort. DEF3 (marker of 
      early granulopoiesis) gene expression on PBMCs was quantified by qPCR. Total CD15(+) 
      LDGs and both CD14(low)CD16(+) and CD14(-)CD16(-) subsets were expanded in CKD. The 
      relative frequency of the CD14(-)CD16(-) subpopulation was higher among the CD15(+) 
      pool in CKD. This alteration was stable over-time. The increased 
      CD14(-)CD16(-)CD15(+) paralleled Kauppila scores and DEF3 expression, whereas no 
      association was found with CD14(low)CD16(+) CD15(+). Both subsets differed in their 
      CD11b, CD10, CD35, CD31, CD62L, IFNAR1 and CD68 expression, FSC/SSC features and 
      nuclear morphology, pointing to different origins and maturation status. In 
      conclusion, LDGs were expanded in CKD showing a skewed distribution towards a 
      CD14(-)CD16(-)CD15(+) enrichment, in association with vascular calcification. DEF3 
      expression in PBMC can be a marker of LDG expansion.

TI  - Expanded Haemodialysis Therapy of Chronic Haemodialysis Patients Prevents 
      Calcification and Apoptosis of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells in vitro.
PG  - 131-138
LID - 10.1159/000484925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease and strongly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. 
      Vascular calcification is an active process mediated in part by inflammatory 
      processes in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). These could be modified by the 
      insufficient removal of proinflammatory cytokines through conventional high-flux 
      (HF) membranes. Recent trials demonstrated a reduction of inflammation in VSMC by 
      use of dialysis membranes with a higher and steeper cut-off. These membranes caused 
      significant albumin loss. Therefore, the effect of high retention Onset (HRO) 
      dialysis membranes on vascular calcification and its implications in vitro was 
      evaluated. METHODS: In the PERCI II trial, 48 chronic dialysis patients were 
      dialyzed using HF and HRO dialyzers and serum samples were collected. Calcifying 
      VSMC were incubated with the serum samples. Calcification was determined using 
      alizarin red staining (AZR) and determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
      activity. Furthermore, apoptosis was evaluated, and release of matrix Gla protein 
      (MGP), osteopontin (OPN) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) were measured 
      in cell supernatants. RESULTS: Vascular calcification in vitro was significantly 
      reduced by 24% (ALP) and 36% (AZR) after 4 weeks of HRO dialysis and by 33% (ALP) 
      and 48% (AZR) after 12 weeks of dialysis using HRO membranes compared to HF 
      dialysis. Apoptosis was significantly lower in the HRO group. The concentrations of 
      MGP and OPN were significantly elevated after incubation with HF serum compared to 
      HRO serum and healthy controls. Similarly, GDF-15 release in the supernatant was 
      elevated after incubation with HF serum, an effect significantly ameliorated after 
      treatment with HRO medium. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded haemodialysis therapy reduces the 
      pro-calcific potential of serum from dialysis patients in vitro. With a markedly 
      reduced albumin filtration compared to high cut-off dialysis, use of the HRO 
      dialyzers may possibly provide a treatment option for chronic dialysis patients to 
      reduce the progression of vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high prevalence 
      of classical coronary risk factors, there is increasing evidence that 
      atherosclerosis is different in renal compared to nonrenal patients. Therefore, the 
      present study compares changes in different vessels obtained at cardiac surgery 
      between patients with early and advanced CKD and nonrenal control patients. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Fifty patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery were divided into 
      three groups: (i) 24 control patients with creatinine <1.3mg/dl, (ii) 14 patients 
      with early CKD (creatinine 1.3-2.0mg/dl), and (iii) 12 patients with advanced CKD 
      (creatinine >2.0mg/dl). Aorta, arteria mammaria interna, and vena saphena (V. 
      saphena) were analyzed using morphometry, Kossa stain for vascular calcification, 
      and immunohistochemistry for markers of inflammation and proosteogenic 
      differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Thereby, aortic wall 
      thickness and calcification score of aortic intima and of V. saphena were 
      significantly higher in advanced CKD patients than in nonrenal control patients, 
      whereas significant vascular inflammation and proosteogenic dedifferentiation of 
      VSMC and calcification of the aortic media were already present in early CKD. 
      Interestingly, marked calcification of the V. saphena magna was seen in advanced 
      CKD. Of note, calcium-phosphate product correlated well with markers of 
      inflammation, but not with calcification itself. CONCLUSIONS: Early stages of CKD 
      are already associated with local up-regulation of proinflammatory and proosteogenic 
      molecules in the vascular wall and calcification of the aortic media. These findings 
      point to the importance of local microinflammation in CKD and may shed new light on 
      the potentially overestimated role of the calcium-phosphate product for vessel 
      calcification.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Altered Circulating Micro RNA -125b and Their 
      Influences on Uremic Vascular Calcification Among Patients With End-Stage Renal 
      Disease.
PG  - e010805
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.010805 [doi]
LID - e010805
AB  - Background Micro RNA -125b (miR-125b) has been shown to regulate vascular 
      calcification ( VC ), and serum miR-125b levels are a potential biomarker for 
      estimating the risk of uremic VC status. However, it is unknown whether clinical 
      features, including chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder molecules, affect 
      serum miR-125b levels. Methods and Results Patients receiving chronic dialysis for 
      ≥3 months were recruited from different institutes. Serum miR-125b and chronic 
      kidney disease-mineral bone disorder effectors, including intact parathyroid 
      hormone, 25- OH -D, fibroblast growth factor-23, osteoprotegerin, and fetuin-A, were 
      quantified. We used multivariate regression analyses to identify factors associated 
      with low serum miR-125b levels and an area under receiver operating characteristic 
      curve curve to derive optimal cutoffs for factors exhibiting close associations. 
      Further regression analyses evaluated the influence of miR-125b on VC risk. Among 
      223 patients receiving chronic dialysis (mean age, 67.3 years; mean years of 
      dialysis, 5.2), 54 (24.2%) had high serum miR-125b levels. Osteoprotegerin ( 
      P=0.013), fibroblast growth factor-23 ( P=0.006), and fetuin-A ( P=0.036) were 
      linearly associated with serum miR-125b levels. High osteoprotegerin levels 
      independently correlated with high serum miR-125 levels. Adding serum miR-125b 
      levels and serum osteoprotegerin levels (≥400 pg/mL) into models estimating the risk 
      of uremic VC increased the area under receiver operating characteristic curve values 
      (for models without miR-125b/osteoprotegerin, with miR-125b, and both: 0.74, 0.79, 
      and 0.81, respectively). Conclusions Serum osteoprotegerin levels ≥400 pg/mL and 
      serum miR-125b levels synergistically increased the accuracy of estimating VC risk 
      among patients receiving chronic dialysis. Taking miR-125b and osteoprotegerin 
      levels into consideration when estimating VC risk may be recommended.

TI  - Albuminuria Changes and Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes: The 
      DCCT/EDIC Study.
PG  - 1969-1977
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In trials of people with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria 
      reduction with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is associated with lower risks of 
      cardiovascular events and CKD progression. We tested whether progression or 
      remission of microalbuminuria is associated with cardiovascular and renal risk in a 
      well characterized cohort of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: We studied 1441 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications 
      Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. Albumin 
      excretion rate (AER) was quantified annually or biennially for up to 30 years. For 
      each participant, albuminuria status was defined over time as normoalbuminuria (AER 
      continuously <30 mg/d), sustained microalbuminuria (AER, 30-299 mg/d on two 
      consecutive visits), macroalbuminuria (AER≥300 mg/d), or remitted microalbuminuria 
      (transition from sustained microalbuminuria to AER<30 mg/d on two consecutive 
      visits). We tested associations of time-updated albuminuria status with adjudicated 
      clinical cardiovascular events, the development of reduced GFR (<60 ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2) on two consecutive visits), and subclinical cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: At 
      least one cardiovascular event occurred in 184 participants, and 98 participants 
      developed reduced eGFR. Compared with normoalbuminuria, sustained microalbuminuria, 
      remitted microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria were each associated with higher 
      risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence 
      intervals [95% CIs]: 1.79 [1.13 to 2.85], 2.62 [1.68 to 4.07], and 2.65 [1.68 to 
      4.19], respectively) and reduced eGFR (adjusted HRs [95% CIs], 5.26 [2.43 to 11.41], 
      4.36 [1.80 to 10.57], and 54.35 [30.79 to 95.94], respectively). Compared with 
      sustained microalbuminuria, remission to normoalbuminuria was not associated with 
      reduced risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.68 to 2.59) or 
      reduced eGFR (adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 5.49). Compared with 
      normoalbuminuria, sustained microalbuminuria, remitted microalbuminuria, and 
      macroalbuminuria were associated with greater carotid intima-media thickness, and 
      macroalbuminuria was associated with a greater degree of coronary artery 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetes, microalbuminuria and 
      macroalbuminuria are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and 
      reduced eGFR, but achieving a remission of established microalbuminuria to 
      normoalbuminuria does not appear to improve outcomes.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy Influences Coronary Artery Calcium Score in Asymptomatic 
      Hemodialysis Patients with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 65-73
LID - 10.1159/000503806 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful parathyroidectomy (PTX) with stable postoperative parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH) levels is associated with the stabilization of coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      (SHPT) undergoing hemodialysis. To use computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the 
      influence of PTX on CACS in asymptomatic patients. METHODS: This study was performed 
      with institutional review board approval. Written consent was obtained from each 
      patient. Forty-eight patients (mean age ± SD 54.50 ± 13.14 years; range 33-77 years) 
      undergoing maintenance hemodialysis who underwent PTX and 56 patients (mean age 
      55.28 ± 12.32 years; range 35-76 years) who did not undergo PTX received prospective 
      follow-up for 2 years. CACS was quantitatively performed using the Agatston method 
      after CT scan. The differences between baseline and end-of-study PTX parameters were 
      analyzed with the paired Student t test. RESULTS: For patients who underwent PTX, 
      mean square root of CACS did not increase from 23.16 ± 18.58 to 23.68 ± 18.16 (t = 
      1.846, p = 0.072) from baseline to follow-up. In patients who did not undergo PTX, 
      mean square root of CACS increased from 20.21 ± 16.47 to 28.72 ± 20.95 (t = 10.110, 
      p < 0.001) from baseline to follow-up. In addition, the median annual progression 
      rate of CACS was lower among PTX patients (4.89%), compared with the marked annual 
      progression rate of CACS in non-PTX patients (52.81%; t = 11.264, p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism caused by SHPT may 
      result in significant CAC progression in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients. Low PTH 
      state after PTX may stabilize CAC progression in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Effect of spironolactone on the progression of coronary calcification in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 345-355
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that aldosterone plays a role in the pathogenesis of 
      vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
      spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, on the progression of 
      coronary calcification (CC) in peritoneal dialysis patients and to identify the 
      factors involved in this progression. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with a coronary 
      calcium score (CCS) ≥ 30, detected through multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) 
      and expressed in Agatston units, were randomly assigned to a group receiving 25mg 
      spironolactone per day for 12 months (spironolactone group) and a control group not 
      receiving this drug. The primary outcome was a percentage change in CCS from 
      baseline to end of the study (relative progression), when a further MDCT was 
      conducted. Patients who had progression of CC were compared with those who did not 
      progress. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, seven in the spironolactone group and nine in 
      the control group, concluded the study. The relative progression of the CCS was 
      similar in both groups, 17.2% and 27.5% in the spironolactone and control groups 
      respectively. Fifty-seven percent of the treated patients and 67% of those in the 
      control group presented progression in the CC scores (p = 0.697). Progressor 
      patients differed from non-progressors because they presented higher levels of 
      calcium and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower levels of albumin. 
      CONCLUSION: In peritoneal dialysis patients, spironolactone did not attenuate the 
      progression of CC. However, large-scale studies are needed to confirm this 
      observation. Disorders of mineral metabolism and dyslipidemia are involved in the 
      progression of CC.

TI  - Bone turnover markers predict type of bone histomorphometry and bone mineral density 
      in Asian chronic haemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) are 
      well-controlled following the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, 
      the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture are still high in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between bone 
      turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone histomorphometry in HD 
      patients. METHODS: Twenty-two chronic HD patients were enrolled. Serum levels of 
      bone turnover markers were measured. Double tetracycline-labelled iliac crest bone 
      specimens were evaluated using specialized a computer program (Osteomeasure). The 
      types of bone histomorphometry were classified based on turnover, mineralization and 
      volume. BMD and coronary artery calcification were also determined. RESULTS: Bone 
      histomorphometry revealed osteitis fibrosa (50%), adynamic bone disease (45%) and 
      mixed uremic osteodystrophy (5%). Serum iPTH level predicted high bone turnover with 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.833 (95% 
      CI = 0.665-1.000, P = 0.008). Serum TRAP-5b also had ROC of 0.733 (95% CI = 
      0.517-0.950, P = 0.065). In addition, when using serum iPTH (cut-off 484.50 ng/mL) 
      or serum TRAP-5b (cut-off 1.91 pg./mL) to predict high turnover, the sensitivity was 
      0.917. On the other hand, when both iPTH and TRAP-5B were above these cut-off, the 
      specificity was 1.000. Low BMD and severe vascular calcification were commonly 
      identified. However, there were no significant correlations between bone biomarkers 
      and BMD or severe vascular calcification. CONCLUSION: Although iPTH levels were 
      close to the target of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, 
      abnormal bone histomorphometry, BMD, and severe vascular calcification are still 
      common. Bone biopsy is still crucially required as an accurate diagnostic tool in 
      providing optimal guide for the treatment. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is an important promoter of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Several indices can be used to 
      evaluate VC, including the abdominal aortic calcification index (AACI) and carotid 
      artery intima-media thickness (IMT); however, simpler and lesser expensive 
      predictors, such as the radial augmentation index (RAI), should be investigated. A 
      total of 101 patients undergoing PD were recruited to measure RAI, AACI, and carotid 
      artery IMT and perform echocardiography. Fifty healthy controls (HCs) were recruited 
      to undergo RAI measurement. RAI in patients undergoing PD was significantly higher 
      than the RAI in HCs (86.25%±8.39% vs. 76.05%±9.81%, p < 0.05). Patients undergoing 
      PD and who suffer with diabetic mellitus, hypertension, and CVD had more severe VC 
      than those without the abovementioned diseases. In patients with PD, RAI was 
      positively correlated with AACI (r = 0.671, p < 0.05) and carotid artery IMT 
      (r = 0.596, p < 0.05). RAI was positively correlated with left ventricular 
      end-diastolic dimensions (LVDd; r = 0.678, p < 0.05), left ventricular mass index 
      (r = 0.595, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with early-diastolic mitral inflow 
      velocity/late-diastolic mitral inflow velocity (r = -0.342, p < 0.05) and left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (r= -0.497, p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed that RAI was associated with AACI, LVDd, age, and serum phosphate 
      (p < 0.05). RAI might be an effective predictor of VC and cardiac 
      structural/functional abnormalities in patients undergoing PD.

LID - e0185846
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with structural and functional 
      abnormality of the heart and blood vessels. We investigated the relationship between 
      intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients, and their impacts on cardiovascular events (CVEs). METHOD: We enrolled 191 
      maintenance HD patients who underwent plain abdomen radiography for abdominal aortic 
      calcification score (AACS). A nadir systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mm Hg or the 
      requirement of bolus fluid administration was required to quantify the hypotension 
      diagnosis. IDH was defined as > 2 hypotension episodes during 10 HD treatments. 
      RESULTS: Among the 191 patients, IDH occurred in 32. AACS was higher in the IDH 
      group compared with the no-IDH group (8.4 ± 6.0 vs. 4.9 ± 5.2, respectively; P = 
      0.001). High AACS was an independent risk factor after adjustment for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, ultrafiltration, diastolic BP, and calcium level (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 
      95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). Patients with both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 had the highest 
      cumulative CVE rate (27.9%, P = 0.008) compared with 11.2%, 12.5%, and 6% for those 
      with AACS ≧ 4 only, with IDH only, and neither, respectively. In multivariate 
      analysis, the presence of both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 was a significant predictor of CVE 
      (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.04-7.74, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: IDH is 
      associated with abdominal aortic calcification and is an independent risk factor for 
      IDH. Both IDH and high AACS were significant predictors of CVE.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of biomarkers of vascular calcification after switch from 
      traditional hemodialysis to online hemodiafiltration.
PG  - 174-181
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2019.1576218 [doi]
AB  - Rapid progression of vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is 
      caused by several factors including inflammation and an imbalance between active 
      inducers and inhibitors of VC. Growing evidence shows that online hemodiafiltration 
      (ol-HDF), a combination of diffusive and convective solute transport, has positive 
      effects on the uremic environment that affects patients on dialysis. However, we 
      recently reported that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) decreased after a switch 
      from HD to ol-HDF. As a consequence of this finding, the present study was 
      undertaken to investigate if inducers and inhibitors of VC (i.e. the inactive matrix 
      Gla protein fractions dp-ucMGP and t-ucMGP, fetuin-A, Gla-rich protein (GRP), 
      osteopontin (OPN), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), and osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG)) also are affected by ol-HDF. This non-comparative prospective study comprised 
      35 prevalent patients who were investigated 6, 12, and 24 months after their switch 
      from HD to ol-HDF. Most patients had increased levels of the calcification 
      inhibitors OPN and OPG; and of the inactive calcification inhibitor dp-ucMGP during 
      the study period irrespective of the dialysis modality. BALP and t-ucMGP were mostly 
      within the reference interval, but fetuin-A was mostly below the reference interval 
      during the study period. OPN was significantly associated with BALP and parathyroid 
      hormone, r = 0.62 and r = 0.65 (p < .001), respectively. In conclusion, in contrast 
      to decreased 25(OH)D levels, no differences were found for any of the measured 
      biomarkers of VC following the switch from HD to ol-HDF. Further studies are needed 
      to elucidate how these biomarkers can contribute to calcification risk assessment.

TI  - Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12888 [doi]
AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification 
      score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 
      2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The 
      difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in the 
      external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total iliac 
      vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease, and 
      diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk factor 
      (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total iliac 
      vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation 
      protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to 
      calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular calcification prior to 
      transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical decisions and to improve 
      patient safety and outcome in increasingly older transplant recipients.

TI  - Relationship between abdominal aortic calcification on plain radiograph and coronary 
      artery calcification detected by computed tomography in hemodialysis patients .
PG  - 123-129
LID - 10.5414/CN109988 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) can be assessed easily using a plain 
      radiograph. We investigated the relationship between AAC assessed by plain 
      radiography and coronary artery calcification (CAC) assessed by computed tomography 
      (CT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 62 hemodialysis patients who underwent lumbar lateral 
      radiography and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) were included in this 
      study. We used logistic regression analyses to identify an independent association 
      between AAC and severe CAC (> 400), and assessed the diagnostic performance of the 
      AAC and CAC scores for prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using 
      receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      participants was 55.3 ± 11.2 years, and 30 (48.4%) were men. 17 participants had a 
      previous history of CVD. The mean dialysis duration was 4.3 ± 3.0 years. The mean 
      AAC score was 3.6 ± 4.1. AAC scores were significantly positively correlated with 
      CAC scores (r = 0.464, p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic analysis, AAC score 
      (odds ratio (OR) 1.387, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.117 - 1.723, p = 0.003) was 
      independently associated with a severe CAC score (> 400). The areas under the ROC 
      curve for CAC and AAC scores were 0.877 (95% CI 0.791 - 0.964, p < 0.001) and 0.723 
      (95% CI 0.570 - 0.876, p = 0.007), respectively. CONCLUSION: A high AAC score on 
      plain radiograph is an independent risk factor for severe CAC score on CT and can be 
      used to predict CVD.

TI  - Association of abdominal aortic calcification estimated by plain radiography with 
      outcomes in haemodialysis patients: A 6-year follow-up study.
PG  - 559-565
LID - 10.1111/nep.13644 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) 
      patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD 
      patients. METHODS: Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal 
      aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 
      was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two 
      groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS < 5) and moderate to severe 
      calcification group (AACS ≥ 5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of 
      the study (30 November 2016). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this 
      study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42 ± 13.48 years. 
      Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to 
      severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02-1.10), P = 0.003), 
      longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00-1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 
      3.01 (1.18-7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels 
      (OR 2.83 (1.01-7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 
      22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe 
      calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) 
      and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor 
      calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 
      1.08 (1.01-1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared 
      with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by 
      a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard 
      ratio 3.14 (1.04-9.44), P = 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that AAC is 
      prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD 
      mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and 
      involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for 
      evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

TI  - Phase Angle Predicts Arterial Stiffness and Vascular Calcification in Peritoneal 
      Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 451-457
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2015.00276 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload (FO) is frequently present in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients and is associated with markers of malnutrition, inflammation, and 
      atherosclerosis/calcification (MIAC) syndrome. We examined the relationships in 
      stable PD patients between phase angle (PhA) and the spectrum of uremic vasculopathy 
      including vascular calcification and arterial stiffness and between PhA and changes 
      in serum fetuin-A levels. METHODS: Sixty-one stable adult PD patients were evaluated 
      in a cross-sectional study (ST1). Phase angle was measured by multifrequency 
      bioimpedance analysis (InbodyS10, Biospace, Korea) at 50 kHz. Augmentation index 
      (AI), a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, was assessed by digital pulse 
      amplitude tonometry (Endo PAT, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). Vascular 
      calcification was assessed by simplified calcification score (SCS). Serum fetuin-A 
      levels were measured by ELISA (Thermo scientific; Waltham, MA, USA). Serum albumin 
      was used as a nutritional marker, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was used as an 
      inflammatory marker. The same assessments were carried out longitudinally (ST2) in 
      the first 33 patients who completed 1 year of evaluation in ST1. RESULTS: In ST1, 
      patients with PhA < 6° had higher CRP levels, AI, and SCS and lower serum albumin 
      and fetuin-A levels, in comparison with patients with PhA ≥ 6°. In addition, PhA was 
      a predictor of both AI (β = -0.351, p = 0.023) and SCS ≥ 3 (EXP (B) = 0.243, p = 
      0.005). In ST2, the increase of PhA over time was associated with decreases in both 
      AI (r = -0.378, p = 0.042) and CRP levels (r = -0.426, p = 0.021), as well as with 
      the increase in serum fetuin-A levels (r = 0.411, p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Phase 
      angle predicts both arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in stable PD 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this population. 
      The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic calcification volume 
      (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 
      a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD 
      stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective observational study. At study 
      entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, 
      haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: 
      The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 
      m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 
      patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only 
      statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male 
      gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 
      0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently 
      associated with AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the 
      presence nor the extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change 
      in GFR during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 
      and 4, only age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not 
      associated with the rate of decline in GFR.

TI  - Localization, Morphologic Features, and Chemical Composition of 
      Calciphylaxis-Related Skin Deposits in Patients With Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy.
PG  - 789-796
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.0381 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), a rare, potentially fatal, disease 
      with calcium deposits in skin, mostly affects patients with end-stage renal disease 
      who are receiving dialysis. Chemical composition and structure of CUA calcifications 
      have been poorly described. OBJECTIVES: To describe the localization and morphologic 
      features and determine the precise chemical composition of CUA-related calcium 
      deposits in skin, and identify any mortality-associated factors. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 
      French hospitals including consecutive adults diagnosed with CUA between January 1, 
      2006, and January 1, 2017, confirmed according to Hayashi clinical and histologic 
      criteria. Patients with normal renal function were excluded. For comparison, 5 skin 
      samples from patients with arteriolosclerosis and 5 others from the negative margins 
      of skin-carcinoma resection specimens were also analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Localization and morphologic features of the CUA-related cutaneous calcium 
      deposits were assessed with optical microscopy and field-emission-scanning electron 
      microscopy, and the chemical compositions of those deposits were evaluated with μ 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive 
      radiographs. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (median [range] age, 64 [33-89] years; 26 
      [72%] female) were included, and 29 cutaneous biopsies were analyzed. Calcific 
      uremic arteriolopathy and arteriolosclerosis skin calcifications were composed of 
      pure calcium-phosphate apatite. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy vascular 
      calcifications were always circumferential, found in small to medium-sized vessels, 
      with interstitial deposits in 22 (76%) of the samples. A thrombosis, most often in 
      noncalcified capillary lumens in the superficial dermis, was seen in 5 samples from 
      patients with CUA. Except for calcium deposits, the vessel structure of patients 
      with CUA appeared normal, unlike thickened arteriolosclerotic vessel walls. Twelve 
      (33%) patients died of CUA. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Calcific uremic 
      arteriolopathy-related skin calcifications were exclusively composed of pure 
      calcium-phosphate apatite, localized circumferentially in small to medium-sized 
      vessels and often associated with interstitial deposits, suggesting its pathogenesis 
      differs from that of arteriolosclerosis. Although the chemical compositions of CUA 
      and arteriolosclerosis calcifications were similar, the vessels' appearances and 
      deposit localizations differed, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Several biomolecules potentially serve as promoters or inhibitors of calcification 
      in dialysis patients which include fetuin A, matrix gla protein, osteopontin, 
      osteoprotegerin, etc. The primary aim was to compare the biomarkers of coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) and to study its role as predictors of CAC in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. Of 126 patients undergoing chronic HD, 100 patients 
      completed the study. Blood samples were drawn for serum creatinine, electrolytes, 
      calcium, phosphorus, Vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), lipid profile, high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, fetuin A, and fibroblast growth factor-23 
      (FGF-23). Non-contrast Computed Tomography scan of the coronary arteries was 
      conducted on all participants. Participants who were positive for CAC (P group) were 
      compared with those negative for CAC (N group) using two sample t-test. Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of CAC. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) was 60% with higher prevalence seen in 
      males (71%), older age group, patients with dialysis vintage >5 years (27%), and 
      diabetic population (62%). Mean serum phosphorus was significantly higher (P <0.001) 
      and fetuin A (P <0.001) was significantly lower in the P group. Age (OR: 1.2, P = 
      0.004), serum phosphorus (OR: 1.8, P = 0.024), and fetuin A (OR: 0.0006, P = 0.001) 
      were found as predictors of CAC. CAC was more prevalent in males, patients with 
      higher age group and in those with longer dialysis vintage and diabetic population. 
      Participants with CAC exhibited significantly high phosphorus and low fetuin A 
      levels. Age, phosphorus level, and fetuin A were found to be predictors of CAC in 
      dialysis patients. FGF-23 could not predict CAC.

TI  - Effects of oral activated charcoal on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification 
      in Chinese patients with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between oral activated charcoal (OAC) and 
      hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification is not completely clear. We observed 
      and recorded the effects of OAC on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in 
      stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 
      we included 97 patients with stage 3-4 CKD. In the first phase of the experiment, 
      the patients were randomly divided into the OAC group and placebo group. The 
      endpoint of this phase was the development of hyperphosphatemia. The patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia were selected into the second phase of the study. These patients 
      underwent coronary artery multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and were randomly 
      divided into three groups: the OAC group, the calcium carbonate (CC) group and the 
      lanthanum carbonate (LC) group. RESULTS: The first and second phases of the 
      experiment were followed for 12 months. In the first phase of the experiment, there 
      was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia between the OAC and placebo groups (28.57% vs. 79.17%, 
      X(2) = 24.958, P = 0.000). In the second phase, the differences in coronary 
      calcification score (CACS) between the OAC group, the CC group and the LC group were 
      statistically significant (525.5 ± 104.2 vs 688.1 ± 183.7 vs 431.4 ± 122.5, 
      P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Oral activated charcoal effectively delays the onset of 
      hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. OAC appears to delay the 
      development of vascular calcifications in stage 3-4 CKD patients.

TI  - Nutrition Status Predicts Severity of Vascular Calcification in Non-Dialyzed Chronic 
      Kidney Disease.
PG  - 316-321
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-16-0911 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major complication in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) that increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Geriatric nutritional 
      risk index (GNRI) is a simple nutritional assessment tool that predicts poor 
      prognosis in elderly subjects. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the 
      correlation between GNRI and severity of vascular calcification in non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients.Methods and Results:We enrolled 323 asymptomatic CKD patients. To evaluate 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), we used aortic calcification index (ACI) 
      determined on non-contrast computed tomography. The patients were divided into three 
      groups according to GNRI tertile. Median ACI significantly decreased with increasing 
      GNRI tertile (15.5%, 13.6%, and 7.9%, respectively; P=0.001). On multivariate 
      regression analysis GNRI was significantly correlated with ACI (β=-0.15, P=0.009). 
      We also investigated the combination of GNRI and C-reactive-protein (CRP) for 
      predicting the severity of AAC. Low GNRI and high CRP were significantly associated 
      with severe AAC, compared with high GNRI and low CRP (OR, 4.07; P=0.004). 
      CONCLUSIONS: GNRI was significantly associated with AAC in non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Inverse J-shaped relation between coronary arterial calcium density and mortality in 
      advanced chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1202-1211
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score from cardiac computed tomography 
      (CT) is a composite of CAC volume and CAC density. In the general population, CAC 
      volume is positively and CAC density inversely associated with cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) events, implying that decreased CAC density reflects atherosclerotic 
      plaque instability. We analysed associations of CAC indices with mortality risk in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease [chronic kidney disease Stage 5 (CKD5)]. 
      METHODS: In 296 CKD5 patients undergoing cardiac CT (median age 55 years, 67% male, 
      19% diabetes, 133 dialysed), the Framingham risk score (FRS), presence of CVD and 
      protein-energy wasting (PEW; subjective global assessment) and high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at baseline. 
      During follow-up for a median of 35 months, 51 patients died and 75 patients 
      underwent renal transplantation. All-cause mortality risk was analysed with 
      competing-risk regression models. Vascular calcification was analysed in biopsies of 
      the arteria epigastrica inferior in 111 patients. RESULTS: Patients in the middle 
      tertile of CAC density had the highest CAC score, CAC volume, age, CVD, PEW, FRS, 
      hsCRP and IL-6. In competing risk analysis, the middle {subhazard ratio [sHR] 10.7 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-57.3]} and high [sHR 8.9 (95% CI 1.5-51.8)] 
      tertiles of CAC density associated with increased mortality, independent of CAC 
      volume. The high tertile of CAC volume, independent of CAC density, associated with 
      increased mortality [sHR 8.9 (95% CI 1.5-51.8)]. Arterial media calcification was 
      prominent and associated with CAC volume and CAC density. CONCLUSIONS: In CKD5, 
      mortality increased linearly with higher CAC score and CAC volume whereas for CAC 
      density an inverse J-shaped pattern was observed, with the crude mortality rate 
      being highest for the middle tertile of CAC density. CAC volume and CAC density were 
      associated with the extent of arterial media calcification.

TI  - Reduction in Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity Is Associated with a Short-Term Reduction in 
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density T Score.
PG  - 346-350
LID - 10.1159/000501392 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We wished 
      to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with changes in 
      bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: We measured 
      vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and BMD by dual electron 
      absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to compensate for differences in 
      patient ages and gender. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had repeat aPWV measurements 
      and DXA scans, median 12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased in 15 and increased in 9. As 
      there were more women in the group with an increase in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted 
      DXA T scores Total body T scores fell in both groups, but median T scores remained 
      positive for those with an increase in aPWV, whereas negative T scores on both scans 
      for those with a decrease in or stable aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in those 
      with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to 0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 0.05), 
      whereas there was no significant decrease in those with an increase in aPWV (-0.5 
      [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]). There were no changes in femoral neck T 
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothesis of a link between bone 
      disease and vascular disease in dialysis patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging 
      of the aorta and will include aortic calcification, and as such a reduction in 
      lumbar spine T score without a change in femoral neck T score suggests a reduction 
      in aortic calcification. Although our study requires additional confirmation, our 
      data would suggest that changes in aPWV could be used as a surrogate for changes in 
      vascular calcification in the investigation of interventions designed to reduce 
      vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary arterial plaques in patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) are assumed to have increased calcification due to underlying renal disease 
      or initiation of dialysis. This relationship may be confounded by comorbid type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: From a single-center OCT registry, 60 patients were 
      analyzed. Twenty patients with ESRD and diabetes (ESRD-DM) were compared to 2 groups 
      of non-ESRD patients: 20 with and 20 without diabetes. In each patient, one 20 mm 
      segment within the culprit vessel was analyzed. RESULTS: ESRD-DM patients exhibited 
      similar calcium burden, arc, and area compared to patients with diabetes alone. When 
      compared to patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes exhibited a greater 
      summed area of calcium (DM: Median 9.0, IQR [5.3-28] mm(2) vs Non-DM: 3.5 [0.1-14] 
      mm(2), p = 0.04) and larger calcium deposits by arc (DM: Mean 45 ± SE 6.2° vs 
      Non-DM: 21 ± 6.2°, p = 0.01) and area (DM: 0.58 ± 0.10 mm(2) vs Non-DM: 
      0.26 ± 0.10 mm(2), p = 0.03). Calcification deposits in ESRD-DM patients 
      (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) and patients with diabetes (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) were more superficially 
      located relative to patients without diabetes (0.21 ± 0.02 mm), p = 0.01 for both. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary calcification in DM and ESRD-DM groups exhibited similar 
      burden, deposit size, and depth within the arterial wall. The increase in coronary 
      calcification and cardiovascular disease events seen in ESRD-DM patients may not be 
      secondary to ESRD and dialysis, but instead due to a combination of declining renal 
      function and diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is commonly observed in chronic 
      dialysis patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We 
      investigated the factors associated with AAC and analyze the relationship between 
      bone-derived biomarkers and AAC. METHODS: We enrolled 227 stable hemodialysis 
      patients. Vascular calcifications were assessed using lateral lumbar radiography of 
      the abdominal aorta. Demographic data were collected and serum levels of biochemical 
      and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), and 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), were measured. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one 
      patients (71.0%) had AAC. Patients with AAC score≧13 were older, with higher body 
      mass index (BMI), serum calcium, calcium phosphate product, high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and FGF23 levels. Sclerostin and DKK-1 levels were 
      inversely associated with AAC severity, and FGF23 was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Hypertension, vascular disease, hsCRP, FGF23, and sclerostin were 
      independent AAC determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hemodialysis patients have a high 
      prevalence of vascular calcifications. Levels of circulating sclerostin, DKK-1, and 
      FGF23 were related to AAC severity. Sclerostin and FGF23 were independently 
      associated with AAC.

AB  - Coronary artery calcifications(CACs), are related to the increased cardiovascular 
      mortality during kidney transplantation(KTx). Using coronary-CT performed at 1 
      month(T0) and 5 years(T5) after KTx we evaluated: (1) the prevalence of CACs; (2) 
      the clinical and biochemical factors related to CACs; 3) the factors implicated with 
      CACs progression. We evaluated 67-pts selected from the 103-pts transplanted in our 
      unit between 2007 and 2008. Clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded at the 
      time of pre-KTx evaluation and for five years after KTx. Coronary-CT for the Agatson 
      score (AS) evaluation was performed at T0 and at T5, and CACs progression was 
      determined. At baseline AS was 45 [0-233]. At T5 AS was 119 [1-413]. At T0, 69% of 
      patients had CACs. Age and dialytic vintage were the main independent variables 
      related to CACs. At T5, CACs were present in 76% of patients. Age was the only 
      independent factor in determining CACs. A progression of CACs was observed in 74% of 
      patients. They were older, had higher CACs-T0 and higher SBP throughout the 5-years. 
      The presence of CACs at T0 and age were the only independent factors in determining 
      the CACs-progression. CACs-T0 had the best discriminative power for CACs 
      progression. CACs prevalence is quite high in KTx patients; Age is strictly related 
      to CACs; Age and the presence of CACs at baseline were the two major factors 
      associated with the progression of CACs during the five years of follow up. CACs-T0 
      had the best discriminative power for progression of CACs.

TI  - Association of conjunctival and corneal calcification with vascular calcification in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and easily 
      detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
      calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone metabolism 
      parameters in dialysis patients. METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30 men, 33 
      women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were on dialysis therapy for more than 6 
      months. Forty-four patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients were on 
      hemodialysis therapy. The same observer evaluated the presence of CCC by using a 
      slit-lamp microscope, and a total CCC score was recorded for each patient. Fifty-two 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls also were evaluated by using the same method. 
      Biochemical data were collected from patient files. Bone mineral density (BMD) of 
      the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured, and the presence of vascular 
      calcification was assessed by using x-ray examinations of the pelvis and hands. 
      RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly higher than that in controls 
      (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC score correlated significantly with 
      duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s = 0.392; P = 0.002), serum phosphorus 
      level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium x phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 
      0.007). However, we did not find a significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The 
      frequency of vascular calcification was significantly greater in patients with a 
      high CCC score (CCC score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% 
      versus 5.6%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and 
      noninvasive method. It seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to 
      assess the status of extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers a marked increase in 
      risk for vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, fracture and mortality, 
      with likely contributing factors including dysregulated bone metabolism and mineral 
      homeostasis. In general population studies, increased vascular calcification is 
      directly related to mortality and inversely related to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In patients with CKD, 
      abnormalities in turnover, mineralization and bone volume reduce the ability of DXA 
      to predict fracture. The trabecular bone score (TBS) obtained from lumbar spine DXA 
      images, provides a surrogate measure of microarchitectural integrity not captured by 
      BMD. This study aimed to examine the association of the TBS to prevalent abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) in patients with CKD receiving dialysis. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study of dialysis patients awaiting transplantation. All 
      patients underwent laboratory testing, lateral spinal radiographs including the 
      abdominal aorta, DXA imaging and TBS assessment. AAC scores were determined using 
      the Kauppila method. Correlations and linear regression models were used to 
      determine predictors of AAC scores. RESULTS: 146 patients (60% male, mean age 
      48 ± 13 years) were included, of whom 49% had prevalent calcification with an AAC 
      score ≥ 1. Of those with calcification, the mean AAC score was 7 ± 5.5 and 42 
      patients had scores ≥ 6, considered to indicate severe AAC. TBS values corresponding 
      to intermediate or high risk for fracture (<1.31) were present in 35% of patients. 
      TBS values correlated inversely to AAC scores (β = -0.206, p = 0.013) and remained 
      significant in multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, BMI and time on 
      dialysis (-0.160, p = 0.031). There was no significant correlation of AAC scores to 
      any BMD parameter. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of AAC in relatively young 
      dialysis patients awaiting transplantation and their AAC scores are inversely 
      related to the TBS but not to DXA-derived BMD parameters. In patients with CKD on 
      dialysis, TBS assessment reflects microarchitectural abnormalities of bone not 
      captured by DXA. The inverse relationship of TBS to vascular calcification may 
      provide insights into bone-vascular interactions in CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of vitamin D in the process of vascular calcification is 
      unclear in patients with chronic kidney disease. We investigated whether serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is associated with vascular calcification in 
      predialysis and dialysis patients. METHODS: We included 86 predialysis and 139 
      dialysis patients. The simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) was evaluated by 
      examining plain X-rays of the pelvis and hands as described previously. The 
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) was assessed with a commercially 
      available device. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in our 
      population (78.2%). Vascular calcification was present in 46.2% of all patients. 
      Higher calcification (SVCS >3) was significantly associated with lower 25(OH)D 
      levels in predialysis and dialysis patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis 
      for SVCS >3 showed that 25(OH)D levels were negative independent predictors in 
      predialysis (OR: 0.781; 95% CI: 0.623-0.908, p = 0.019) and dialysis patients (OR: 
      0.805; 95% CI: 0.749-0.853, p = 0.009). Lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with 
      higher CF-PWV in predialysis patients, but this inverse relationship was no longer 
      present in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: We showed an independent relationship 
      between low serum 25(OH)D levels and vascular calcification in both predialysis and 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - Slow Progression of Aortic Calcification Is a Potential Benefit of Pre-emptive 
      Kidney Transplantation.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pre-emptive kidney transplantation (PKT) is expected to improve graft and 
      cardiovascular event-free survival compared with standard kidney transplantation. 
      Aortic calcification is reported to be closely associated with renal dysfunction and 
      cardiovascular events; however, its implication in PKT recipients remains 
      incompletely explored. This aim of this study was to evaluate whether PKT confers a 
      protective effect on aortic calcification, renal function, graft survival, and 
      cardiovascular event-free survival. METHODS: One hundred adult patients who 
      underwent renal transplantation between January 1996 and March 2016 at Hirosaki 
      University Hospital and Oyokyo Kidney Research Institute were included. Among them, 
      19 underwent PKT and 81 patients underwent pretransplant dialysis. We 
      retrospectively compared pretransplant and post-transplant aortic calcification 
      index (ACI), renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), and graft 
      and cardiovascular event-free survivals between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The median 
      age of this cohort was 45 years. Preoperative ACI was significantly lower in PKT 
      recipients. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding 
      postoperative eGFR, graft survival, and cardiovascular event-free survival. However, 
      the ACI progression rate (ΔACI/y) was significantly lower in PKT recipients than in 
      those who underwent pretransplant dialysis. Higher ACI was significantly associated 
      with poor cardiovascular event-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: PKT is beneficial in that 
      it contributes to the slow progression of after transplantation. Although we could 
      not observe significant differences in graft and cardiovascular event-free survivals 
      between the 2 groups, slow progression of aortic calcification showed a potential to 
      decrease cardiovascular events in PKT recipients during long-term follow-up.

TI  - Associations of Serum Calciprotein Particle Size and Transformation Time With 
      Arterial Calcification, Arterial Stiffness, and Mortality in Incident Hemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 346-354
LID - S0272-6386(20)30889-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.05.031 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of the transformation of primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles (CPPs) in serum, including the size of secondary CPP (CPP2) 
      aggregates and the time of transformation (T(50)), may be markers for arterial 
      calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We examined the associations 
      of CPP2 aggregate size and T(50) with arterial calcification in incident HD 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident 
      HD patients (n=402with available CPP2 measures and n=388with available T(50) 
      measures) from the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End-Stage 
      Renal Disease (PACE) Study PREDICTORS: Serum CPP2 size and T(50) at baseline. 
      OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were baseline coronary artery and thoracic aorta 
      calcifications. Exploratory outcomes included baseline arterial stiffness, measured 
      by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ankle brachial index, and longitudinally, repeat 
      measures of PWV and all-cause mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Tobit regression, 
      multiple linear regression, Poisson regression, linear mixed-effects regression, and 
      Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 55±13 years, 41% were 
      women, 71% were Black, and 57% had diabetes mellitus. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) 
      were correlated with baseline fetuin A level (r=-0.59 for CPP2 and 0.44 for T(50); 
      P<0.001 for both), but neither was associated with baseline measures of arterial 
      calcification or arterial stiffness. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) were not 
      associated with repeat measures of PWV. During a median follow-up of 3.5 (IQR, 
      1.7-6.2) years, larger CPP2 was associated with higher risk for mortality (HR, 1.17 
      [95% CI, 1.05-1.31] per 100nm larger CPP2 size) after adjusting for demographics and 
      comorbid conditions, but there was no association between baseline T(50) and risk 
      for mortality. LIMITATIONS: Possible imprecision in assays, small sample size, 
      limited generalizability to incident HD populations with different racial 
      composition, and residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In incident HD patients, neither 
      CPP2 size nor T(50) was associated with prevalent arterial calcification and 
      stiffness. Larger CPP2 was associated with risk for mortality, but this finding 
      needs to be confirmed in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic renal disease are susceptible to accelerated 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Micro RNAs 
      (miRNAs) have been linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in the 
      general population. AIM: This study was carried out to evaluate the link between 
      miRNA 192 and vascular calcification, pre-existing as well as newly occurring major 
      adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality among hemodialysis patients who are 
      also considered to be potential kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We screened 
      64 potential transplant recipients on hemodialysis at our university hospital. 
      Pre-existing overt cardiovascular disease was recorded; new adverse cardiovascular 
      events and all causes of death over an observational period of 5 years were 
      prospectively followed. Vascular calcification was measured in the aorta using 
      computerized tomography scans, and micro RNA 192 was measured. RESULTS: The final 
      study population included 55 patients followed for 63 months. Micro RNA 192 was 
      significantly lower in patients who had preexisting cardiovascular disease (P = 
      .015) as well and in all patients who had experienced any event by the end of the 
      observational period (P = .012). A multiregression analysis model including micro 
      RNA, age, dialysis vintage, intradialytic hypotension, vascular calcification, 
      diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and smoking found the only independently 
      correlating factor to cardiovascular events in this model to be micro RNA (β = 
      -0.286, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA 192 levels are significantly lower among 
      patients experiencing cardiovascular events while on hemodialysis awaiting kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Hypercalcemia Is a Risk Factor for the Progression of Aortic Calcification in Kidney 
      Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 823-834
LID - 10.1159/000501740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification is common and progressive in chronic kidney 
      disease, including kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). However, the risk factors 
      associated with the progression of aortic calcification (AoC) in KTRs have not been 
      fully elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated AoC and examined the factors 
      associated with its advancement in KTRs. MATERIALS: This was a prospective 
      longitudinal study that included 98 KTRs. We quantitatively investigated infrarenal 
      abdominal AoC using the Agatston score, as measured by multi-slice computed 
      tomography. After the baseline investigation, a follow-up scan was performed after 3 
      years, and the Agatston scores were obtained again. The changes in laboratory data 
      affecting the 2nd Agatston scores were examined by multivariable analysis using 
      non-linear regression after adjustment for several confounders. RESULTS: The 2nd 
      Agatston scores were significantly greater than the baseline Agatston scores (p < 
      0.001). After adjustment for the confounders, the change in corrected serum calcium 
      exhibited a significant non-linear correlation with the 2nd Agatston scores (p = 
      0.022 for non-linearity/p = 0.031 for the effect of corrected serum calcium). 
      Moreover, an interaction was present from the baseline AoC in the effect of 
      corrected serum calcium on the progression of AoC, and the effect of hypercalcemia 
      was greater in patients with higher baseline Agatston scores (p = 0.049). 
      CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that hypercalcemia is a risk factor for the 
      development of infrarenal abdominal AoC in KTRs. Furthermore, the effect of 
      hypercalcemia was greater in patients with more severe vascular calcification.

AB  - Elevated levels of FGF23 in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are 
      associated with adverse health outcomes, such as increased mortality, large vessel 
      disease, and reduced white matter volume, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. 
      Apart from the well-known link between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, especially 
      diabetes and hypertension, and cerebrovascular damage, elevated FGF23 is also 
      postulated to be associated with cerebrovascular damage independently of CKD. 
      Elevated FGF23 predisposes to vascular calcification and is associated with vascular 
      stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in the general population with normal renal 
      function. These factors may lead to microangiopathic changes in the brain, 
      cumulative ischemia, and eventually to the loss of white matter fibers. The 
      relationship between FGF23 and brain integrity in individuals without CKD has 
      hitherto not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the association 
      between FGF23, and white matter integrity in a cohort of 50 participants with 
      varying degrees of CV risk burden, using high resolution structural human brain 
      connectomes constructed from MRI diffusion images. We observed that increased FGF23 
      was associated with axonal loss in the frontal lobe, leading to a fragmentation of 
      white matter network organization. This study provides the first description of the 
      relationship between elevated levels of FGF23, white matter integrity, and brain 
      health. We suggest a synergistic interaction of CV risk factors and FGF23 as a 
      potentially novel determinant of brain health.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal aortic calcification by computed tomography for prediction

      patients with chronic kidney disease: A single center cross-sectional study.
PG  - 939-948

AB  - Introduction: There is general interest in finding clinical markers for left 
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), a major cause of cardiorenal syndrome 
      leading to heart failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim was to 
      assess the utility of computed tomography (CT)-based abdominal aortic calcification 
      (AAC) for the prediction of LVDD and prognosis of asymptomatic pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients. Materials and methods: We prospectively evaluated 218 pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients [median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); 40.9 mL/min/1.73m²]. 
      Non-contrast CT scan and echocardiography were performed to determine the aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) as a semi-quantitative measure of AAC. Results: The median 
      ACI was 11.4. AAC and LVDD were diagnosed in 193 patients (89%) and 75 patients 
      (34%), respectively. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the 
      estimation of LVDD, ACI of 20 showed optimal sensitivity (52.0%) and specificity 
      (62.8 %) (AUC = 0.664, p < .001). High ACI group included more patients with 
      LVDD-related factors, such as old age, hypertension, diabetes, and more severe CKD. 
      LVDD was significantly more common in patients with high ACI group [39 (50%) and 36 
      (26%), respectively, p<0.001]. Multivariate analysis showed that ACI correlated 
      significantly with E/A (β=-0.993, p=0.003), E/e' (β=0.077, p<0.001), and 
      cardio-ankle vascular index (β=0.209, p=0.001). Correspondingly, E/e' correlated 
      with logBNP and log(ACI+1), and increased proportionately and significantly with the 
      quartiles of ACI values. Cox proportional hazard models showed that ACI was an 
      independent predictor of CV outcome (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 
      1.00-1.06, p=0.029). Conclusion: The results would suggest the usefulness of AAC 
      assessment by CT to predict latent LVDD and future CV risk in asymptomatic 
      pre-dialysis CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vascular calcification is an independent risk factor for 
      cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in end stage renal disease, and 
      particularly in hemodialysis patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be 
      associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. 
      Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D 
      [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and 
      vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the 
      effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in 
      hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly 
      assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a 
      placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, 
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their 
      product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at 
      baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: 
      NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and 
      fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference 
      was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect 
      on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any 
      adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, 
      tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, 
      with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are representative 
      markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical 
      outcomes remain undetermined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 523 patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been examined with fundus photography 
      for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple radiographs were analyzed for the 
      presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC of the abdominal aorta and 
      iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was evaluated in terms of the rate of 
      renal function decline and composite of any cardiovascular event or death. CKD 
      patients with retinopathy showed higher prevalence of apVC than those without 
      retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001).The presence of retinopathy was 
      independently associated with apVC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate 
      analysis, compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence 
      of both apVC and retinopathy were independently associated with rapid renal function 
      decline (β = -1.51; 95% CI -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were 
      not. Compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite 
      end points were 1.05 (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 
      1.17, 3.67) for patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with 
      both apVC and retinopathy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of VC and 
      retinopathy was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular 
      events or deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a common complication associated with chronic 
      kidney disease and the major cause of cardiovascular disease in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease. The vascular calcification risk burden is still unknown in 
      China. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of vascular calcification and 
      assess the predictive value of vascular calcification in patients with stage 5 
      chronic kidney disease on dialysis in China. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a national, 
      multicenter, non-interventional, prospective cohort study planning to recruit 1520 
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
      for at least 6 months in 24 dialysis centers in China. All the patients provided 
      written informed consents before participating in this study. It will include a 
      baseline visit and 24 months follow-up period with 4 other visits at 6-month 
      intervals. Vascular calcification images will be obtained to determine the 
      prevalence of vascular calcification, coronary artery calcification, abdominal 
      aortic calcification and cardiac valve calcification. Association between vascular 
      calcification and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events will be assessed. Disease management, as assessed by serum 
      level of calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone and its impact on 
      vascular calcification, will also be surveyed. DISCUSSION: The new results gained 
      from this study will supplement limited current available data and provide better 
      clinical decisions in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a multifactorial dysregulation of 
      bone and vascular calcification and closely linked to increased cardiovascular 
      mortality and concomitant bone disease. We aimed to investigate specific microRNA 
      (miRNA) signatures in CKD patients to find indicators for vascular calcification 
      and/or bone mineralization changes during CKD and after kidney transplantation (KT). 
      A miRNA array was used to investigate serum miRNA profiles in CKD patients, then 
      selected miRNAs were quantified in a validation cohort comprising 73 patients in CKD 
      stages 3 to 5, 67 CKD patients after KT, and 36 healthy controls. A spectrum of 
      biochemical parameters including markers for kidney function, inflammation, glucose, 
      and mineral metabolism was determined. The relative expression of miR-223-3p and 
      miR-93-5p was down-regulated in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared to healthy 
      controls. This down-regulation disappeared after kidney transplantation even when 
      lower glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) persisted. MiR-223-3p and miR-93-5p were 
      associated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and eGFR levels, and by trend with 
      interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-peptide, hematocrit, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). This 
      study contributes new knowledge of serum miRNA expression profiles in CKD, 
      potentially reflecting pathophysiological changes of bone and calcification pathways 
      associated with inflammation, vascular calcification, mineral and glucose 
      metabolism. Identified miRNA signatures can contribute to future risk markers or 
      future therapeutic targets in bone and kidney disease.

TI  - In-situ analysis of mast cells and dendritic cells in coronary atherosclerosis in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).
PG  - 871-886
LID - 10.14670/HH-11-988 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Mast cells (MC) and dendritic cells (DC) have immune modulatory function and 
      can influence T-cell activity. Both cell types have been found in atherosclerotic 
      plaques and are thought to play an important role for plaque stability. Compared to 
      matched segments of the non-renal population, patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) show a more pronounced and more aggressive course of atherosclerosis with 
      higher plaque calcification and significantly higher complications rates. It was the 
      aim of this study to analyze the number and localization of MCs and DCs, 
      macrophages, T- and B-cells as well as the expression of markers of inflammation 
      such as CRP and NFκB in calcified and non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques of 
      patients with CKD and control patients. METHODS: Fifty coronary atherosclerotic 
      plaques from patients with endstage CKD (CKD, n=25) and control (n=25) patients were 
      categorized according to the Stary classification and investigated using 
      immunohistochemistry (markers for MC, DC, T, B, macrophage and NFκB). Expression was 
      analyzed separately for the complete plaque area as well as for the different plaque 
      subregions and correlations were analyzed. RESULTS: We found only very few DCs and 
      MCs per lesion area with slightly increased numbers in calcified plaques. MCs per 
      plaque area were significantly more frequent in CKD than in control patients and 
      this was independent of plaque calcification. MCs were most frequently found in the 
      shoulder and basis of the plaque. DCs per plaque area were significantly less in 
      calcified plaques of CKD compared to control patients. In control, but not in CKD 
      patients, DCs were significantly more frequent in calcified than in non-calcified 
      plaques. Within the plaques DCs were similarly distributed between all 4 subregions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary atherosclerotic plaques of CKD patients showed a significantly 
      higher number of MCs whereas DCs were less frequent compared to control patients 
      particularly if plaques were calcified. These findings might indicate a potential 
      proinflammatory role of MCs, but not of DCs in atherosclerotic lesions of CKD 
      patients, adding another characteristic of advanced atherosclerosis in these 
      patients.

TI  - [Association between low serum magnesium levels and the extent of abdominal aortic 
      calcification in renal transplant recipients].
LID - 2020-vol1 [pii]
AB  - Introduction: In renal transplant recipients (RTRs) vascular calcifications has been 
      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality. 
      Recent experimental and clinical studies showed that magnesium (Mg) deficiency may 
      be related to the progression of vascular calcification. Aim of this study was to 
      determine the hypothetical association between Mg and vascular calcifications in 
      RTRs. Methods: Seventy-one RTRs underwent a lateral X-ray of the lumbar spine to 
      assess the presence of calcification of the abdominal aorta. Abdominal aortic 
      calcium (AAC) content was graded with a score ranging from 0 to 24 points. At the 
      same time were evaluated: carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT); left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMi); sCa, sPO4, sMg, uMg, PTH, HDL, LDL, blood pressure 
      (BP). Results: AAC was correlated with: age (r=0.601; P<0.001), dialysis vintage 
      (r=0.314; P<0.01), sMg (r=-0.438; P<0.001), PTH (r=0.322; P<0.01), SBP (r=0.539; 
      P<0.001), IMT (r=0.706; P<0.001), LVMi (r=0.326; P<0.01). Serum Mg was correlated 
      with PTH (r= -0.304; P<0.01). IMT was correlated with LVMi and SBP (r=0.330, P<0.01; 
      r=0.494, P <0.0001; respectively). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that 
      the final model contained six predictor variables for AAC (IMT, sMg, age, SBP, 
      proteinuria, and dialysis vintage; F5,64=31.7, P<0.001; Adjusted R2 =0.718). 
      Patients in higher AAC thirtile (8-24) were older, with longer dialysis vintage, 
      lower sMg, higher PTH, and higher IMT values. Conclusions: Our results suggest a 
      hypothetical interrelationship between sMg and ACC, and IMT in RTRs.

TI  - Osteocalcin (bone GLA protein) levels, vascular calcifications, vertebral fractures 
      and mortality in hemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00595-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as one of the major causes of 
      end stage kidney disease. Bone Gla protein (BGP) is a vitamin K-dependent protein 
      involved in bone mineralization and vascular calcifications (VC). Our goal was to 
      characterize BGP and undercarboxylated BGP (ucBGP) in DM patients on HD, compared to 
      HD patients without DM, and their association with vascular and bone disease. 
      METHODS: 387 HD patients from 18 dialysis centers in Italy. Associations of DM, 
      levels of BGP, vitamin D and VC were evaluated. Time-to-event analysis for all-cause 
      mortality was performed by the Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: Patients with DM had lower 
      levels of total BGP (139.00 vs. 202.50 mcg/L, p < 0.001), 25(OH)D (23.4 vs. 
      30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and ucBGP (9.24 vs. 11.32 mcg/L, p = 0.022). In regression 
      models, the geometric means of total BGP and ucBGP were 19% (p = 0.009) and 26% 
      (p = 0.034) lower in diabetic patients. In univariate Cox regression analysis, DM 
      patients had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR:1.83, 95% CI 1.13-2.96, 
      p = 0.014). Adjustment for confounders confirmed the significant DM-mortality link. 
      We included VC and warfarin into the Cox model, the DM-mortality link was no longer 
      significant, suggesting a role of these risk factors as causal mediators leading to 
      increased mortality in dialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients have an increased 
      mortality risk associated with DM. Furthermore, we found an association between DM 
      and decreased BGP levels. Although our study does not support the notion that BGP 
      levels act as mediator in the DM-mortality link, to our knowledge this is the first 
      study in HD patients suggesting a potential protective role of BGP in the bone, 
      endocrine and vascular pathway.

TI  - Arterial Stiffness as a Risk Factor for Subclinical Coronary Artery Calcification in 
      Predialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: From the KNOW-CKD Study.
PG  - 426-434
LID - 10.1159/000499648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Both arterial stiffness and coronary artery calcification (CAC) are 
      important predictors of cardiovascular disease in the general population and in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Recent studies on arterial stiffness and CAC 
      in subjects with preserved renal function have verified the association between the 
      two. However, the relationship is not well evaluated in CKD patients. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study analyzed 1,385 predialysis CKD patients from the KNOW-CKD 
      cohort. Participants were divided into four groups according to brachial-ankle pulse 
      wave velocity (baPWV) quartile. Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) were assessed 
      using cardiac computed tomography and CAC was defined as a CACS >100. RESULTS: CAC 
      prevalence was higher in the higher baPWV groups (6.4, 9.8, 23.7, and 43.8% for the 
      1st to 4th quartiles of baPWV, respectively, p < 0.001). In Tobit regression 
      analyses that were fully adjusted for traditional and renal cardiovascular risk 
      factors, the CACS ratio comparing the highest and lowest baPWV quartiles was 3.03 
      (95% CI, 1.59-6.87). Similarly, the OR for CAC in the highest baPWV quartile 
      compared to the lowest quartile was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.09-3.60) in a fully adjusted 
      multivariate logistic model. Results were consistent across analyses with different 
      cutoffs for CAC or with different clinically relevant subgroups. CONCLUSION: 
      Increased arterial stiffness measured by high baPWV was associated with CAC in a 
      predialysis CKD cohort. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the effect of 
      arterial stiffness on the development or progression of CAC in CKD.

AB  - The effect of chronic metabolic acidosis (MA) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the 
      setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to 
      study this relationship in nondialysis CKD patients.This cross-sectional, 
      single-center study prospectively enrolled 95 clinically stable CKD patients (median 
      age 61 (58, 65) years, 60% male, median eGFR 27 (22, 32) mL/min). Data on CKD 
      etiology, CVD history, CVD traditional, and nontraditional risk factors were 
      obtained. Also, markers of subclinical CVD were assessed: intima-media thickness 
      (IMT), abdominal aortic calcifications (Kauppila score-AACs), cardio-ankle vascular 
      index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI), ejection fraction, and interventricular 
      septum thickness. Using the serum bicarbonate cutoff value of 22 mEq/L, comparisons 
      between MA (<22 mEq/L; 43 patients) and non-MA (≥22 mEq/L; 52 patients) groups were 
      performed.Vascular (40%), tubulointerstitial (24%), and glomerular (22%) 
      nephropathies were the main causes of CKD. Twenty-three percent of patients had 
      diabetes mellitus, but only 5% were considered to have diabetic nephropathy. 
      Patients with chronic MA had lower eGFR (P < .01), higher iPTH (P = .01), higher 
      serum phosphate (P < .01), and increased serum cholesterol (P = .04) and 
      triglycerides (P = .01).Higher ABI (P = .04), lower IMT (P = .03), CAVI (P = .05), 
      and AACs (P = .03) were found in patients with chronic MA.Separate binomial logistic 
      regression models were performed using ABI (cutoff 0.9), CAVI (cutoff 9), IMT 
      (cutoff 0.1 cm), and AACs (cutoff 1) as dependent variables. MA was used as 
      independent variable and adjustments were made for iPTH, serum phosphate, eGFR, 
      proteinuria, cholesterol, triglycerides, CVD score. The absence of MA was retained 
      as an independent predictor only for the presence of AACs.In conclusion, the present 
      study shows a potential advantageous effect of MA on vascular calcifications in 
      predialysis CKD patients. Thus, a guideline relaxation of the serum bicarbonate 
      target might prove to be beneficial in CKD patients at high risk of vascular 
      calcifications. However, one should always consider the negative effects of MA. 
      Therefore, additional research is warranted before any clear clinical 
      recommendation.

TI  - FGF-23, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular diseases in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 121-8

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients have bad prognosis and 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent their main threatening complication. 
      Fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) has been associated with all kinds of evil 
      consequences, including cardiovascular morbidity, but some studies demonstrated the 
      contrary. Therefore, it is important to know whether FGF-23 is associated with 
      cardiovascular risk or protection. The purpose of this study was to assess the links 
      between FGF-23 and intimal vascular calcification (VC) and with the presence of CVD 
      in chronic HD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on a cohort 
      of randomly selected 88 prevalent HD patients. We recorded demographical, clinical, 
      and biochemical data, including FGF-23. VC was evaluated on carotid ultrasound. CVD 
      were registered. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.68 ± 14.49 years, HD vintage was 59.61 
      ± 52.39 months, and 20 patients were diabetic (22.72 %). VC was present in 54 
      patients (61.4 %) and 25 patients (28.4 %) had CVD. FGF-23 correlated positively 
      with HD vintage (r = 0.37; p < 0.001) and iPTH (r = 0.21; p = 0.048). FGF-23 did not 
      correlate with VC score. Patients with CVD were older (p = 0.006), had lower FGF-23 
      (p = 0.008), higher VC score (p = 0.009), lower Hb (p = 0.008), albumin (p = 0.003), 
      and creatinine (p = 0.03). Low FGF-23 was identified as a risk factor for CVD. 
      CONCLUSION: We report on a novel association between low FGF23 and CVD in chronic HD 
      patients and a lack of correlation of FGF-23 with VC. FGF-23 could play a role in 
      cardiovascular protection that remains to be confirmed in larger studies.

TI  - Inflammation and the bone-vascular axis in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 489-97
LID - 10.1007/s00198-015-3233-8 [doi]
AB  - Bone loss and vascular calcification coincide in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease, similar as to what is observed in the general population. In the present 
      bone biopsy study, we provide further evidence that (micro-)inflammation may 
      represent a common soil for both diseases. INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a 
      common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is predictive of 
      subsequent cardiovascular disease and mortality. Mounting evidence linking bone 
      disorders with vascular calcification has contributed to the development of the 
      concept of the bone-vascular axis. Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of 
      both disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship 
      between aortic calcification, inflammation, and bone histomorphometry in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: Parameters of inflammation and mineral metabolism were assessed 
      in 81 ESRD patients (55 ± 13 year, 68 % male) referred for renal transplantation. 
      Static bone histomorphometry parameters were determined on transiliac bone biopsies 
      performed during the transplant procedure. Aortic calcification was quantified on 
      lateral lumbar X-rays using the Kauppila method. RESULTS: Aortic calcification, low 
      bone turnover, and low bone area were observed in 53, 37, and 21 % of patients 
      respectively. Inflammatory markers were found to be independently associated with 
      aortic calcification (hsIL-6) and low bone area (TNF-α). Low bone area associated 
      with aortic calcification, independent of age, diabetes, and inflammation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Low bone area and inflammation associates with aortic calcification, 
      independent of each other and traditional risk factors. Our data emphasize the role 
      of (micro-)inflammation in the bone-vascular axis in CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND Determination of prognosis based on ischemia detection, using 
      single‑photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT‑MPI), 
      can be challenging in patients with multiple affected coronary arteries. AIMS The 
      aim of the study was to examine the outcomes of SPECT‑MPI combined with the coronary 
      artery calcium score (CACS) to identify predictors of adverse cardiac events (ACEs) 
      in patients for whom ischemia detection may be difficult using SPECT‑MPI. METHODS 
      The study group included 195 patients with a history of chronic kidney disease, 
      suspected ischemic cardiomyopathy, or left bundle branch block. All patients 
      underwent SPECT‑MPI and CACS evaluation. During the follow‑up, ACEs were recorded. 
      Perfusion and functional parameters as well as the CACS were analyzed to find the 
      predictors of ACEs. RESULTS The ACEs were recorded in 58 individuals (29.7%) and 
      were significantly associated with ischemia (P <0.001), abnormal functional 
      parameters (P = 0.04), and higher CACSs (P <0.001). The optimal cutoff value of the 
      CACS to predict an ACE was 530. Cox proportional hazards models revealed that age, 
      mild and severe ischemia, functional abnormalities, and a CACS of 530 or higher were 
      significant predictors of ACEs. In the subgroup of individuals without ischemia, a 
      CACS of 530 or higher was significantly associated with poor outcome, while we 
      recorded only 3 ACEs in these patients when the CACS was lower than 530. CONCLUSIONS 
      The addition of the CACS to SPECT‑MPI improves the identification of patients at 
      higher risk for ACEs, even in individuals for whom SPECT‑MPI is challenging.

AB  - To determine the safety of low-calcium-dialysate in patients undergoing maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) and its effects on coronary artery calcification (CAC) and 
      analyze clinical risk factors for CAC. A total of 174 MHD patients were recruited 
      and randomly divided into two groups: high-calcium dialysate (HCD, 1.5 mmol/L 
      Ca(2+)) and low-calcium dialysate (LCD, 1.25 mmol/L Ca(2+)). Changes in CAC score 
      (CACS) and cardiac function were evaluated using spiral computed tomography and 
      echocardiography, respectively. Clinical and laboratory parameters were measured. 
      Intra-dialysis adverse reactions were recorded and compared between the two groups. 
      CACS was significantly lower in the LCD group than in the HCD group by the end of 
      the study. Cardiac E/A(max) was significantly higher in the LCD group than in the 
      HCD group by the end of the study. There was no significant difference in the 
      frequency of any intra-dialysis adverse reactions between the two groups during the 
      study. LCD is helpful in maintaining cardiac diastolic function and postponing CAC 
      progression. LCD does not increase intra-dialysis adverse reactions. Age may be the 
      most important factor impacting CAC in MHD patients.

AB  - Vascular calcification is common in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and can be 
      measured using abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). Loss of residual renal function 
      (RRF) is associated with increased mortality in HD patients. However, the 
      association between loss of RRF and vascular calcification is unknown. The aim of 
      the study was to analyze the association between loss of RRF and VC in HD patients. 
      All chronic HD (HD for more than 3 months) patients of China Medical University 
      Hospital in 2014 were included. AAC scores were measured semi-quantitatively based 
      on later lumbar radiographs. Loss of RRF was defined as urine output less than 200 
      mL per day. The association between loss of RRF and AAC was analyzed using logistic 
      regression. Four hundred and thirty-eight chronic HD patients with a mean age of 63 
      ± 12 years were analyzed. The median (interquartile range) AAC score of all patients 
      was 7 (2-13). The AAC score of patients with loss of RRF was 9 (3-22), significantly 
      higher than that of patients with RRF 5 (0-17) (P = 0.004). Loss of RRF, independent 
      of patients' age, diabetes, C-reactive protein, calcium-phosphorus product and 
      vintage of dialysis was associated with higher AAC scores. Loss of RRF was 
      associated with vascular calcification in HD patients.

LID - 10.1159/000366449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of bone formation, but the meaning of 
      its serum levels remains undetermined. We evaluated the association between 
      sclerostin levels and clinical or biological data in hemodialyzed patients (HD), 
      notably parathormone (PTH), biomarkers of bone turnover, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality after 2 years. METHODS: 164 HD patients were included in this 
      observational study. The calcification score was assessed with the Kauppila method. 
      Patients were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: Median sclerostin levels were 
      significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in HD versus healthy subjects (n = 94) (1,375 vs. 
      565 pg/ml, respectively). In univariate analysis a significant association (p < 
      0.05) was found between sclerostin and age, height, dialysis vintage, albumin, 
      troponin, homocysteine, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I, 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteoprotegerin, but not with the 
      calcification score. In a multivariate model, the association remained with age, 
      height, dialysis vintage, troponin, homocysteine, phosphate, PTH, but also with 
      vascular calcifications. Association was positive for all variables, except PTH and 
      vascular calcifications. The baseline sclerostin concentration was not different in 
      survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a higher concentration of 
      sclerostin in HD patients, a positive association with age and a negative 
      association with PTH. A positive association with phosphate, homocysteine and 
      troponin calls for additional research. The clinical interest of sclerostin to 
      assess vascular calcifications in HD is limited and no association was found between 
      sclerostin and mortality.

TI  - Plasma Complement Protein C3a Level Was Associated with Abdominal Aortic 
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 496-505

AB  - The complement system plays an important role in cardiovascular disease in patients 
      on hemodialysis. Vascular calcification is also one of the major causes of 
      cardiovascular disease. We want to investigate the relationship between complement 
      activation and vascular calcification in dialyzed patients. One hundred eight 
      hemodialysis patients and 65 heathy controls were enrolled prospectively. Plasma 
      C3a, C5a, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) 
      levels were detected using ELISA. Plasma C3c, fB, fH, C1q, and C4 levels were 
      measured by immunity transmission turbidity. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      was measured by abdomen lateral plain radiograph, and the AAC score was calculated. 
      We identified increased level of MBL and decreased level of C3c and complement 
      factor B compared with normal control. However, C1q, complement factor H, and C4 
      levels remained at a similar level compared with individuals with normal renal 
      function. The C3a and C5a levels increased, without change of MAC. Forty two of 108 
      HD patients had the AAC score. C3a levels were correlated with AAC score (r = 0.461, 
      p = 0.002). The median C3a concentration was 238.72 (196.96, 323.41) ng/mL. When 
      evaluated as AAC categories (≤ 4, > 5) with ordinal logistic regression, univariate 
      analyses revealed that higher C3a levels were associated with severe AAC, while 
      multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and calcium level showed that higher 
      C3a levels (OR, 6.28 (1.25-31.69); p = 0.03) were associated with severe AAC. The 
      areas under the curve (AUC) for C3a to diagnose severe abdominal aortic 
      calcification were 0.75(0.58-0.92, 0.01). The complement system was activated in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Higher C3a levels are independently associated with severe 
      AAC. Plasma C3a might have a diagnostic value for the severe AAC in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the coronary circulation and 
      calcification in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. 
      METHODS: A total of 50 children with ESRD and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in 
      the study. Cardiac functions and coronary blood flow were evaluated with 
      conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. Coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) was evaluated using high-resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT). 
      RESULTS: The hyperemic coronary flow volume (CFV) and coronary flow reserve were 
      significantly lower in the patient group than in the controls, while there was no 
      significant difference in the baseline CFV between the two groups. Hypertension was 
      present in 60% and CAC was observed in 20% of the children in the patient group. CAC 
      was present in 30% of the children in the hypertensive subgroup. The left ventricle 
      myocardial performance index (LV MPI), CAC score, duration of hypertension and level 
      of diastolic blood pressure were independent predictors of the coronary blood flow, 
      and LV MPI, serum parathyroid hormone, duration of dialysis and E'/A' mitral valve 
      were independent predictors of coronary calcification. CONCLUSION: High diastolic 
      blood pressure, long duration of hypertension, high LV MPI and increased CAC scores 
      are independent risk factors for impaired coronary blood flow in children with ESRD.

TI  - Vascular calcification in South African dialysis patients: ethnic variation, 
      prevalence, detection and haemodynamic correlates.
PG  - 607-15

AB  - AIM: Studies from the US have shown little effect of ethnicity on vascular 
      calcification in dialysis patients. This has not been examined in the multi-ethnic 
      population of South Africa where genetic and environmental differences may exist. We 
      assessed the extent and severity of vascular calcification in South African dialysis 
      patients according to race and known risk factors. We further evaluated the 
      association of abdominal aorta calcification with coronary artery calcification. 
      METHOD: Seventy-five CKD-5D patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled 
      consecutively. All subjects underwent chest computed tomography for coronary calcium 
      score and abdominal X-ray for abdominal aorta calcium score. Ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring was generated via radial artery applanation tonometry. RESULTS: 
      Coronary calcification was present in 38.6% of patients and was associated with age 
      and prior cardiovascular disease on multivariate analyses. The median coronary 
      calcium score in black patients was 0 (IQR 0) and 66 in non-Blacks (IQR 383, P < 
      0.001); controls had a coronary calcium score of 0 (IQR 0). Black race remained a 
      significant negative predictor for coronary calcification after adjustment, 
      prevalence ratio = 0.14 and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0-0.53. Vascular 
      calcification was not associated with any ambulatory blood pressure parameter. Using 
      receiver operator characteristic curves, an abdominal aorta calcification score of 
      ≥1 showed an area under the curve of 0.83 to predict a coronary calcium score ≥ 10. 
      CONCLUSION: Black race appears to protect from vascular calcification in South 
      African CKD-5D patients and this warrants further study regarding the underlying 
      mechanism. The abdominal X-ray is a useful screening tool for coronary 
      calcification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate of Fetuin-A and Pentraxin3 
      (PTX3) as the main factors for vascular calcification and inflammation in 
      hemodialysis (HD) and renal transplant (RT) patients. METHOD: Serum was obtained 
      from 45 stable chronic HD patients and 44 stable RT recipients. Biochemical factors, 
      intact Parathormone, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Fetuin-A and PTX3 
      levels were determined by standard methods. RESULTS: In the RT recipients PTX3 level 
      was significantly higher than the HD patients [5.78(1.09-20.36) ng/mL vs. 
      1.65(0.24-7.89) ng/mL, p ≤ 0.001]. Serum Fetuin-A concentration was significantly 
      higher in the HD compared to RT group [43.39(27.75-81.48) ng/mL vs. 
      38.76(22.26-89.07) ng/mL, p=0.020]. hsCRP level was also higher in the HD than the 
      RT group [2.90(0.1-8.50) mg/L vs. 1.1(0.1-7.9) mg/L, p=0.003]. CONCLUSION: Although 
      our study shows that serum PTX3 is increased and Fetuin-A is decreased after 
      successful RT, their direct role on atherosclerosis needs further studies in the 
      future.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score predicts the occurrence of coronary artery 
      disease in middle-aged peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 336-340
LID - 10.1111/nep.13231 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score in dialysis patients was associated 
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) in cross-sectional study, but the use of AAC 
      score in the CAD prediction was not clear. We aimed to use AAC score in the 
      estimation of CAD occurrence in middle-aged peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. 
      METHODS: Middle-aged (45-65 years old) PD patients were recruited and followed up 
      until CAD occurrence, patient mortality, or PD failure. We quantified AAC score by 
      lateral lumbar radiography, and used receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis to find 
      the cut-off value for CAD prediction. RESULTS: There were 187 patients recruited for 
      study with a mean follow-up of 1027 ± 427 days. AAC score in patients with CAD 
      during follow-up period (9.7 ± 7.6, n = 41) was higher than in patients without CAD 
      occurrence (5.5 ± 6.1, n = 146) (P < 0.001). Multivariate hazard ratio of AAC score 
      for CAD was 1.07 (P = 0.044). ROC showed that AAC score of 5.5 had a sensitivity of 
      0.667 and a specificity of 0.581 in the prediction of CAD occurrence. Patients with 
      AAC score above 5.5 had significantly higher cumulative incidence of CAD than 
      patients with AAC score below 5.5 (Log-rank test, P = 0.003). Age (P = 0.002), 
      diabetes (P = 0.002), hypertension (P = 0.032), longer dialysis vintage (P < 0.001) 
      and lower serum potassium (P = 0.012) were parameters significantly associated with 
      higher AAC score. CONCLUSION: AAC score can predict CAD occurrence in PD patients. 
      Age, diabetes, hypertension, dialysis vintage and serum potassium level are factors 
      associated with higher AAC score.

LID - 35375
AB  - Studies on aortic arch calcification (AAC) and mortality risk in maintenance 
      dialysis patients have yielded conflicting findings. We conducted this meta-analysis 
      to investigate the association between the presence of AAC and cardiovascular or 
      all-cause and mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients. Observational studies 
      evaluating baseline AAC and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risk in 
      maintenance dialysis patients were searched through the PubMed and Embase, CNKI, VIP 
      and Wanfang databases until January 2016. A total of 8 studies with 3,256 dialysis 
      patients were identified. Compared with patients without AAC, the presence of AAC 
      was associated with greater risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard risk [HR] 2.30; 
      95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.78-2.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.44; 95% CI 
      1.19-1.75). Subgroup analyses indicated that the pooled HR for cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality was 2.31 (95% CI 1.57-3.40) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.96) for the 
      grade 2/3 AAC. Peritoneal dialysis patients with AAC had greater cardiovascular (HR 
      3.93 vs. HR 2.10) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.36 vs. HR 1.33) than hemodialysis 
      patients. The AAC appears to be independently associated with excessive 
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in maintenance dialysis patients. Regular 
      follow-up AAC might be helpful to stratify mortality risk in dialysis patients.

TI  - Associations between Thyroid Hormones, Calcification Inhibitor Levels and Vascular 
      Calcification in End-Stage Renal Disease.
PG  - e0132353

LID - e0132353
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common, serious and elusive complication 
      of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As a pro-calcifying risk factor, non-thyroidal 
      illness may promote vascular calcification through a systemic lowering of vascular 
      calcification inhibitors such as matrix-gla protein (MGP) and Klotho. METHODS AND 
      MATERIAL: In 97 ESRD patients eligible for living donor kidney transplantation, 
      blood levels of thyroid hormones (fT3, fT4 and TSH), total uncarboxylated MGP 
      (t-ucMGP), desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), descarboxyprothrombin 
      (PIVKA-II), and soluble Klotho (sKlotho) were measured. The degree of coronary 
      calcification and arterial stiffness were assessed by means of cardiac CT-scans and 
      applanation tonometry, respectively. RESULTS: fT3 levels were inversely associated 
      with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and measures of arterial stiffness, 
      and positively with dp-ucMGP and sKlotho concentrations. Subfractions of MGP, 
      PIVKA-II and sKlotho did not associate with CAC scores and arterial stiffness. fT4 
      and TSH levels were both inversely associated with CAC scores, but not with arterial 
      stiffness. DISCUSSION: The positive associations between fT3 and dp-ucMGP and 
      sKlotho suggest that synthesis of MGP and Klotho is influenced by thyroid hormones, 
      and supports a link between non-thyroidal illness and alterations in calcification 
      inhibitor levels. However, the absence of an association between serum calcification 
      inhibitor levels and coronary calcification/arterial stiffness and the fact that MGP 
      and Klotho undergo post-translational modifications underscore the complexity of 
      this association. Further studies, measuring total levels of MGP and membrane bound 
      Klotho, should examine this proposed pathway in further detail.

TI  - Association of mineral content outside of bone with coronary artery calcium and 
      1-year cardiovascular prognosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 988-1001
LID - 10.1111/aor.13461 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery calcifications (CACs) are common among maintenance hemodialysis 
      (MHD) patients and associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to 
      cardiovascular events. The insight into chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone 
      disorder (CKD-MBD) established a correlation between dysregulated mineral metabolism 
      and CACs. This study aimed to identify the association of mineral content outside of 
      bone (MCOB) with CACs and cardiovascular events in MHD patients. In the pilot 
      prospective study with no intervention, patients underwent body composition 
      assessment by body composition monitor after hemodialysis and computed tomography 
      examination using the Agatston scoring method simultaneously within a week. The 
      primary end point included cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. 
      Correlations and receiver operating characteristic analysis elucidated the 
      associations of MCOB with CACs; multivariate analysis assessed the cardiovascular 
      risk for groups with different MCOB. One hundred three eligible patients with an 
      average age of 48 (35-63) years old were enrolled and followed up to 12 (11-12.5) 
      months, among which 52.4% had detectable CACs at baseline. MCOB showed an inverse 
      correlation with Agatston score and significantly discriminated the patients with 
      Agatston score > 0 (AUC = 0.737; P < 0.001) and 400 (AUC = 0.733; P < 0.001). MCOB 
      ≤ 9.2657 mg/kg was an independent risk factor for CACs (OR = 4.853; P = 0.044) and 
      strong predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (HR = 10.108; 
      P = 0.042), as well as rehospitalization (HR = 2.689; P = 0.004). MCOB inversely 
      correlated with the presence and extent of CACs, and could discriminate Agatston 
      score > 0 and 400, which also presented as an independent indicator for CKD-MBD and 
      1-year cardiovascular prognosis in adult MHD patients. Additional studies are 
      required for identifying this issue.

TI  - Abdominal Aortic Calcifications Predict Survival in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 366-373
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2017.00043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease and vascular calcifications contribute 
      significantly to the outcome of dialysis patients. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the prognostic role of severity of abdominal aortic calcifications and 
      peripheral arterial disease on outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients using 
      methods easily available in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: We enrolled 249 PD 
      patients (mean age 61 years, 67% male) in this prospective, observational, 
      multicenter study from 2009 to 2013. The abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) 
      was assessed using lateral lumbar X ray, and the ankle-brachial index (ABI) using a 
      Doppler device. RESULTS: The median AACS was 11 (range 0 - 24). In 58% of the 
      patients, all 4 segments of the abdominal aorta showed deposits, while 19% of 
      patients had no visible deposits (AACS 0). Ankle-brachial index was normal in 49%, 
      low (< 0.9) in 17%, and high (> 1.3) in 34% of patients. Altogether 91 patients 
      (37%) died during the median follow-up of 46 months. Only 2 patients (5%) with AACS 
      0 died compared with 50% of the patients with AACS ≥ 7 (p < 0.001). The adjusted 
      hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 4.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94 - 
      24.46) for aortic calcification (AACS ≥ 7), 2.14 for diabetes (yes/no), 0.93 for 
      albumin (per 1 g/L), and 1.04 for age (per year). A low or high ABI were not 
      independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severe aortic calcification 
      was a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in PD patients. The evaluation of 
      aortic calcifications by lateral X ray is a simple method that allows the 
      identification of high-risk patients.

AB  - Background. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) contributes to high risk of 
      cardiocerebrovascular diseases in dialysis patients. However, the risk factors for 
      CAC initiation in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are not known clearly. Methods. 
      Adult patients with baseline CaCS = 0 and who were followed up for at least 3 years 
      or until the conversion from absent to any measurable CAC detected were included in 
      this observational cohort study. Binary logistic regression was performed to 
      identify the risk factors for CAC initiation in PD patients. Results. 70 patients 
      recruited to our study were split into a noninitiation group (n = 37) and an 
      initiation group (n = 33) according to the conversion of any measurable CAC during 
      their follow-up or not. In univariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, serum 
      phosphorus, fibrinogen, hs-CRP, serum creatinine, and triglycerides were positively 
      associated with the initiation of CAC, while the high density lipoprotein and nPCR 
      did the opposite function. Multivariate analysis revealed that hyperphosphatemia and 
      hs-CRP were the independent risk factors for CAC initiation after adjustments. 
      Conclusions. Hyperphosphatemia and hs-CRP were the independent risk factors for CAC 
      initiation in PD patients. These results suggested potential clinical strategies to 
      prevent the initiation of CAC in PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) hydrolyzes pyrophosphate, 
      which inhibits vascular calcification. We examined association between serum BAP and 
      vascular calcification of male hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Hand roentgenography 
      of 167 male maintenance hemodialysis patients was conducted, and visible vascular 
      calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Serum levels of 3 bone formation 
      markers (BAP, osteocalcin, and N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen) and 2 bone 
      resorption markers (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and cross-linked 
      N-telopeptide of type I collagen) were measured, along with serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH). RESULTS: Of 167 patients, visible vascular calcification was seen in 
      37 patients. Among the bone formation and resorption markers, serum BAP was 
      significantly higher in patients with vascular calcification than in those without 
      (p<0.05); although the other 5 serum bone markers were not significantly different 
      between them. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that log [BAP] was 
      significantly associated with vascular calcification after adjustment for age, 
      hemodialysis duration, presence of diabetes, log [intact PTH] and each of the other 
      5 bone markers (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum BAP, but not other bone 
      markers, is significantly associated with the presence of vascular calcification in 
      male hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney recipients are increasingly older with arterial disease and 
      extended arterial calcifications. In a kidney transplantation population, the 
      prognosis value of aortic and iliac calcifications remains poorly explored. We aimed 
      to assess the impact of pretransplantation aortoiliac vascular calcifications on 
      patients, grafts survival, and cardiovascular events. METHODS: This retrospective 
      study included kidney transplantation patients from 2006 to 2012 for whom we had 
      available presurgery abdominal computed tomography results (n = 100). We designed a 
      score to quantify aortoiliac calcifications. Primary end points were patient and 
      graft survival. Secondary end points were renal function and cardiovascular 
      morbidity. Predictive performances of calcification score were assessed using area 
      under receiver-operating characteristic curves. Patients were classified in 
      quartiles depending on global calcium score value. RESULTS: The cumulated rate of 
      death and graft loss was 13% with no significant differences for survival between 
      quartiles. No significant difference was observed in renal function (P = 0.4). 
      Seventeen cardiovascular events were registered with a significant correlation 
      between calcium score elevation and need of cardiovascular surgery during the 
      follow-up (P = 0.01). Global calcium score had a predictive value of 74.5% (95% 
      confidence interval 0.62-0.87) with 71% sensitivity and 73% specificity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Aortoiliac calcifications do not decrease patient and graft survival. 
      High calcium score predict cardiovascular events and procedures during the 
      follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of vascular conduits (donor iliac artery or saphenous 
      vein) in renal transplantation recipients with extensive aortoiliac calcification. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vascular conduits were used in 10 renal transplants with 
      severe vascular calcification at Cleveland Clinic from 2009 to 2013. Both iliac 
      artery (N = 8) and saphenous vein (N = 2) grafts were used. Surgical technique is 
      reviewed in detail. Surgical complications, patency on renal transplant 
      ultrasonography, and serum creatinine level at multiple time points were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 26 months (7-44 months). Mean serum creatinine 
      level was 1.42 mg/dL (1.04-1.74 mg/dL) at 6 months, 1.35 mg/dL (0.83-1.86 mg/dL) at 
      12 months, and 1.43 mg/dL (0.79-1.81 mg/dL) at last follow-up. All patients were 
      demonstrated postoperatively to have patent vasculature on renal ultrasonography. No 
      patients experienced lower extremity vascular complications. Death-censored graft 
      survival was 100%. One patient died from complications after mitral valve 
      replacement, and one patient died from metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the 
      tongue. Both patients had functioning grafts at the time of death. CONCLUSION: 
      Vascular conduits can be used to facilitate renal transplantation in the setting of 
      severe recipient aortoiliac calcification, thus allowing for successful 
      transplantation of these complex recipients.

TI  - Aortic bypass surgery for asymptomatic patients awaiting a kidney transplant: A word 
      of caution.
PG  - e13218
LID - 10.1111/ctr.13218 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the presence of severe aorto-iliac calcification, aortic bypass 
      surgery can be mandatory to allow kidney transplantation. The aim of our study was 
      to evaluate the safety and outcomes of this strategy among asymptomatic patients. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients that 
      had undergone vascular bypass surgery prior to kidney transplantation between 
      November 2004 and March 2016. All patients undergoing aortic bypass surgery prior to 
      kidney transplantation without any vascular-related symptoms were included. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one asymptomatic patients were included. Ten patients (48%) have not received 
      a kidney transplant. Four patients died before kidney transplantation, including 2 
      deaths related to the bypass surgery (9.5%). Early post-operative morbidity involved 
      11 cases. Eleven patients (52%) were transplanted. Transplanted patients were 
      significantly younger (median age 60 [56-61] vs 67 [60-72] years, P = .04) at the 
      time of bypass and were less frequently treated for coronary heart disease (9% vs 
      50%, P = .06). CONCLUSION: Aortic bypass surgery performed prior to kidney 
      transplantation among asymptomatic patients has significant mortality and morbidity 
      rates. When transplantation is possible, the results are satisfying. Larger studies 
      are required to define the selection criteria, such as age and coronary heart 
      disease.

TI  - Arterial micro-calcification of vascular access is associated with aortic arch 
      calcification and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 216-22

AB  - Vascular calcification of the coronary arteries or aorta is an independent risk 
      factor for cardiovascular outcome, but clinical significance of arterial 
      micro-calcification (AMC) of vascular access is unclear in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Sixty-five patients awaiting vascular access operation were enrolled. We 
      compared surrogate markers of cardiovascular morbidity such as aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) by chest radiography, arterial stiffness by brachial-ankle 
      pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and endothelial dysfunction by flow-mediated dilatation 
      (FMD) between patients with and without AMC of vascular access on von Kossa 
      staining. AMC of vascular access was detected in 36 (55.4%). The AMC-positive group 
      had significantly higher incidence of AoAC (63.9% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001) and higher 
      baPWV (26.5 ± 9.4 m/s vs. 19.8 ± 6.6 m/s, p = 0.006) than the AMC-negative group. 
      There was no significant difference in FMD between the two groups (5.4 ± 2.6% vs. 
      5.7 ± 3.5%, p = 0.764). The AMC-positive group had higher incidence of diabetes 
      mellitus, higher systolic blood pressure and wider pulse pressure than the 
      AMC-negative group. This study suggests that AMC of vascular access may be 
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity via AoAC and arterial stiffness in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Relationship between Fetuin A, Vascular Calcification and Fracture Risk in Dialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - e0158789

LID - e0158789
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures are a common morbidity that lead to worse outcomes in dialysis 
      patients. Fetuin A inhibits vascular calcification (VC), potentially promotes bone 
      mineralization and its level positively correlates with bone mineral density in the 
      general population. On the other hand, the presence of VC is associated with low 
      bone volume in dialysis patients. Whether the fetuin A level and VC can predict the 
      occurrence of fractures in dialysis patients remains unknown. METHODS: We performed 
      this prospective, observational cohort study including 685 dialysis patients (629 
      hemodialysis and 56 peritoneal dialysis) from a single center in Taiwan for a median 
      follow-up period of 3.4 years. The baseline fetuin A level and status of presence of 
      aortic arch calcification (VC) and incidence of major fractures (hip, pelvis, 
      humerus, proximal forearm, lower leg or vertebrae) were assessed using adjusted Cox 
      proportional hazards models, recursive partitioning analysis and competing risk 
      models. RESULTS: Overall, 177 of the patients had major fractures. The incidence 
      rate of major fractures was 3.29 per 100 person-years. In adjusted analyses, the 
      patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels had a lower incidence of fractures 
      (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.18‒0.5, fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 
      and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34‒0.78, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1). The presence of aortic 
      arch calcification (VC) independently predicted the occurrence of fractures 
      (adjusted HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.34‒2.84) as well. When accounting for death as an 
      event in competing risk models, the patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels 
      remained to have a lower incidence of fractures (SHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17‒0.56, 
      fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32‒0.81, tertile 2 vs. tertile 
      1). INTERPRETATIONS: Lower baseline fetuin A levels and the presence of VC were 
      independently linked to higher risk of incident fractures in prevalent dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Abdominal aorta calcification predicts cardiovascular but not non-cardiovascular 
      outcome in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: A prospective cohort study.

AB  - Abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) is associated with worse clinical outcomes in 
      dialysis patients. However, the long-term prognostic values of AAC to cardiovascular 
      (CV) and non-CV mortality in patients starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain 
      unknown. This study is aimed to the analyze the predictive power of AAC to CV and 
      non-CV mortality in PD patients. We prospectively enrolled 123 patients undergoing 
      PD. All patients received quantitative analysis of AAC via abdominal computer 
      tomography at enrollment. The AAC ratio was measured by the area of the whole aorta 
      affected by aortic calcification above the iliac bifurcation. The CV mortality and 
      non-CV mortality during the follow-up period were investigated using the Cox 
      proportional hazard model and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      analysis. After median 6.8 (interquartile range, 3.6-9.2) years of follow-up, there 
      were 18 CV mortality, 24 non-CV mortality and 42 total mortality. The age and AAC 
      ratio were significantly higher in CV mortality group compared with others without 
      CV mortality. In time-dependent ROC analysis, AAC had excellent predictive power of 
      CV mortality (AUC:0.787) but not non-CV mortality (AUC:0.537). The best cutoff value 
      of AAC ratio to predict CV mortality was 39%. In addition, AAC was not associated 
      with non-CV mortality but remained to be a significantly predictor of CV mortality 
      after adjusted with clinical covariates in different Cox proportional hazard models. 
      AAC has excellent prognostic value of CV mortality but is unable to predict non-CV 
      morality in patients undergoing PD.

TI  - Association studies of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) polymorphisms with serum

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in renal transplant 
      recipients (RTRs) and linked to arterial calcification. The calcium-sensing receptor 
      (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a pivotal role in extracellular calcium 
      homeostasis and is expressed in the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall. 
      We investigated whether common CASR gene variants are predictors for aortic and 
      coronary artery calcification or influence risk factors such as serum calcium, 
      phosphate and glucose concentrations in RTRs. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty four 
      RTRs were investigated for associations between three CASR promoter region single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs115759455, rs7652589, rs1501899), three 
      non-synonymous CASR coding region SNPs (A986S, R990G, Q1011E), and aortic and 
      coronary artery calcium mass scores, cardiovascular outcomes and calcification risk 
      factors that included serum phosphate, calcium, total cholesterol and glucose 
      concentrations. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that RTRs homozygous for the 
      minor allele (SS) of the A986S SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major 
      allele (AA), had raised serum glucose concentrations (8.7±5.4 vs. 5.7±2.1 mmol/L, 
      P<0.05). In addition, RTRs who were heterozygous (CT) at the rs115759455 SNP, when 
      compared to those homozygous for the major allele (CC), had higher serum phosphate 
      concentrations (1.1±0.3 vs. 1.0±0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05). CASR SNPs were not significant 
      determinants for aortic or coronary artery calcification, and were not associated 
      with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this RTR cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Common 
      CASR SNPs may be independent predictors of serum glucose and phosphate 
      concentrations, but are not determinants of vascular calcification or cardiovascular 
      outcomes.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not associated with increased ambulatory central aortic 
      systolic pressure in prevalent dialysis patients.
PG  - 4-8
LID - 10.5830/CVJA-2013-081 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts 
      cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent 
      dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also determined 
      whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with changes in 
      CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement. METHODS: All 
      patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score, lateral abdominal 
      radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left ventricular mass 
      index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro calibrated to brachial 
      blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard BPro SOFT(®) data into 
      ambulatory CASP. RESULTS: Ambulatory CASP was not different in those without and 
      with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 
      mmHg, respectively, p = 0.2) calcification. Furthermore, when expressed as a 
      percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure to control for peripheral blood 
      pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished: CASP: brachial systolic blood 
      pressure ratio = 0.9 across all categories regardless of the presence of coronary or 
      aortic calcification (p = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Supporting this finding, left 
      ventricular mass index was also not different in those with or without vascular 
      calcification (p = 0.7 and 0.8 for coronary and aortic calcification). 
      Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP correlated excellently with ambulatory 
      measurements (r = 0.9 for both). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcification was not 
      associated with changes in ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure in this 
      cohort of prevalent dialysis patients. Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP 
      correlated very well with ambulatory measurement.

      Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1159/000491025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "T50," shortened transformation time from primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein fetuin-A 
      is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid For Vascular Outcome Prevention 
      In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled 
      clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We 
      conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly selected subcohort of 
      patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum T50 and fetuin-A were 
      determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. 
      RESULTS: During a median surveillance of 2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD 
      events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were 
      associated with CVD after adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood 
      pressure, age, sex, race, preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, 
      total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin 
      inhibitor, or lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 
      urinary albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, 
      T50, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI 
      1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect 
      modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as reduced 
      fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained associated 
      with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD risk factors, 
      measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical characteristics and 
      demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term KTRs. Increased hsCRP was 
      an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations.

      50% or chronic atrial fibrillation) were excluded; DD of the remaining 89 patients 
      was classified into four grades. We then investigated the relationship between their 
      DD grades and the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), ankle-brachial pressure index 
      (ABI), toe-brachial pressure index (TBI), and aortic calcification area index 
      (ACAI). Seventy-seven patients (86.5%) with EF ≥ 50% had DD. Associations with 
      advanced age and comorbid diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease were 
      observed. The CAVI, TBI, and ACAI, but not ABI, increased proportionally with DD 
      grades. Thus, many hemodialysis patients developed DD, with systolic function 
      maintained. Strong associations between DD grades and progression of both 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification could be inferred.

PG  - 228-236
LID - 10.1159/000489097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the combined effects of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and diabetes on the extent and developmental pattern of coronary 
      artery disease (CAD). METHODS: A total of 3,017 self-referred asymptomatic 
      individuals without known CAD who underwent 64-channel dual-source coronary computed 
      tomography angiography between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled. The patients were 
      divided into six groups based on their diabetes status (nondiabetic or diabetic) and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal renal 
      function; eGFR 60-89, mild CKD; or eGFR 30-59, moderate CKD). We compared the 
      coronary artery calcium score (CACS), segment stenosis score (SSS), and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD among the groups. RESULTS: In nondiabetics, whereas SSS and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD were not different as renal function deteriorated, after adjusting 
      for cardiovascular risk factors, CACS showed a unique developmental pattern: no CACS 
      increase until mild CKD, but abrupt increase from the stage of moderate CKD 
      (moderate vs. normal renal function, adjusted OR 5.118, 95% CI 1.293-20.262, p = 
      0.020). In diabetics, patients from the stage of mild CKD were more likely to have 
      ≥50% obstructive CAD (p = 0.004), higher CACS (p = 0.020), and SSS (p = 0.001) in 
      multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CKD did not have a significant 
      impact on the development of coronary atherosclerosis, but affected the progression 
      of coronary calcification more markedly from the stage of moderate CKD in 
      nondiabetics. However, in diabetics, the deterioration of renal function was 
      significantly associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and 
      calcification from the stage of mild CKD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular (CV) events in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness, also 
      predicts CV events in RTR. The study investigated the relationship between CAC and 
      PWV in RTR and assessed the performance of PWV measurement in predicting CAC. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: The study was performed as cross-sectional analysis in 104 RTR. 
      CAC was determined as total calcium score (CS) and calcium mass (CM). 
      Carotid-femoral PWV was also measured. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to assess the performance of PWV as 
      diagnostic test for presence of CAC. RESULTS: CAC was found in 69% of participants. 
      PWV was higher in RTR with CAC than in RTR without CAC (10.2±2.2 vs. 8.6±15; 
      p<0.001). In univariate analysis CS was significantly correlated with age, duration 
      of hypertension, waist circumference, PWV, hemoglobin concentration, and serum 
      glucose. In multiple linear regression analysis CS was independently associated with 
      age only, but not with PWV. Sensitivity and specificity of PWV>7.6m/s as cut-off for 
      detecting CAC>0 was 0.889 and 0.406, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      PWV>10.2m/s as cut-off for detecting severe CAC (CS>400) was 0.319 and 0.969, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed high prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification in renal transplant recipients. The study does not support the 
      hypothesis that aortic stiffness is independently associated with coronary artery 
      calcification in RTR. PWV measurement may be useful in excluding severe CAC in RTR.

TI  - Circulating Wnt/β-catenin signalling inhibitors and uraemic vascular calcifications.
PG  - 1356-63
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of vascular calcification has been associated with the 
      canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in cell cultures and animal studies. The 
      relationship between circulating Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors and vascular calcification 
      in dialysis patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      associations between serum dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) and sclerostin, two circulating 
      inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, and the severity of aortic 
      calcification (AoC) and cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients. METHODS: This 
      was a prospective observational cohort study. One hundred and twenty-five patients 
      on maintenance haemodialysis participated in the study. Serum levels of Dkk-1 and 
      sclerostin were measured. AoC scores were calculated from plain films of both 
      posterior-anterior and lateral views. The patients were followed up for 2 years or 
      until death or withdrawal. RESULTS: The circulating sclerostin level was inversely 
      associated with the severity of AoC (P = 0.035) and indicators of the bone turnover 
      rate including serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (r = -0.235, P = 0.008) and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (r = -0.523, P < 0.001). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis 
      indicated that the patients with high circulating sclerostin levels were less likely 
      to experience future cardiovascular events [1 pmol/L sclerostin increase, hazard 
      ratio 0.982 (95% CI, 0.967-0.996), P = 0.015] after adjusting for a propensity 
      score. In contrast, serum Dkk-1 was not associated with AoC and clinical outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In long-term haemodialysis patients, circulating sclerostin but not 
      Dkk-1 is inversely associated with AoCs and future cardiovascular events. Our 
      findings suggest that sclerostin, as a bone-related protein, might act as a 
      communicator between uraemic bone and vasculature.

AB  - PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim 
      of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma 
      FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent 
      coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution color Doppler 
      ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs 
      was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 
      400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, 
      and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level 
      was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 
      0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence 
      of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal 
      regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs 
      together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model 
      r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in 
      patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the 
      prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with 
      carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in predialysis CKD patients and patients on 
      hemodialysis (HD) and to study the risk factors associated with it. In this 
      prospective study, 205 patients were including 104 patients with predialysis CKD and 
      101 patients were on maintenance hemodialysis. AAC was assessed using lateral lumbar 
      radiography. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, 
      highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and total cholesterol were analyzed. AAC 
      was observed in 26 % of predialysis CKD patients and 34% in HD patients. Using 
      multivariate analysis, the age (P = 0.001) was identified as independent predictor 
      for the presence of AAC in predialysis patients, and for HD, the predictors were age 
      (P = 0.025), time on dialysis (P = 0.001), hsCRP (P = 0.002), and corrected calcium 
      (P = 0.030). In conclusion, the prevalence of AAC varies mainly with age and 
      glomerular filtration rate levels in predialysis CKD patients. Advanced age, time on 
      dialysis, and inflammation may be associated with presence and extent of AAC in HD 
      patients. Further research into the risk factors and outcome for AAC is warranted.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification and renal resistive index in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease: is there a connection?
PG  - 173-9
LID - 10.1007/s40620-013-0021-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) and renal resistive index (RRI), parameters associated with 
      cardiovascular outcome, in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      METHODS: Seventy-seven stable patients mainly in CKD stages 3B and 4 (44 and 28%), 
      median age 69 years, with a positive history of systemic atherosclerosis were 
      prospectively enrolled. RRI, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), Kauppila score 
      for AAC (AACs), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) 
      were assessed. Traditional and non-traditional atherosclerosis risk factors were 
      also evaluated. RESULTS: Vascular (50%), diabetic (26%) and primary glomerular 
      nephropathies (8 %) were the main causes of CKD. AAC was highly prevalent (77%). In 
      the whole cohort, RRI was directly related to AACs (rs = 0.35, p < 0.001). AACs 
      correctly identified patients with RRI >0.7 in 69% (56-81%) of cases, a cut-off of 5 
      resulting the best combination of sensitivity (65%) and specificity (68%). Compared 
      to those with AACs <5, patients with AACs >5 were older, had higher serum 
      cholesterol, C-reactive protein and IMT, lower ABI, but similar CAVI, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, serum calcium and phosphate. In the whole cohort, AACs 
      was negatively correlated with ABI (rs = -0.51, p < 0.001) and positively with IMT 
      (rs = 0.27, p = 0.01), supporting a role for Kauppila score in integrating 
      information on both intra- and extrarenal atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: As Kauppila 
      score correlates with RRI in non-dialysis CKD patients, it could be a fast, 
      convenient and relatively inexpensive tool for estimating RRI, and consequently the 
      intrarenal vascular status, but further research is warranted.

      and Abdominal Arteries in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1092-1104
LID - 10.5551/jat.39271 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Fast-progressing vascular calcification (VC) is accompanied by renal atrophy 
      and functional deterioration along with atherosclerosis in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between VC progression and renal 
      functional and/or morphological changes remains unclear. METHODS: We included 70 
      asymptomatic patients with CKD without hemodialysis in our study. To identify 
      temporal variations, the coronary artery calcification score (CACS), abdominal 
      aortic calcification index (ACI), and renal parenchymal volume index (RPVI) were 
      determined via spiral computed tomography scans taken during the study. We 
      investigated significant factors related to annualized variations of CACS (ΔCACS/y) 
      and ACI (ΔACI/y). RESULTS: During the follow-up period (4.6 years), median values of 
      CACS [in Agatston units (AU)] and ACI increased from 40.2 to 113.3 AU (p=0.053) and 
      from 13.2 to 21.7% (p=0.036), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that CACS 
      at baseline (p＜0.001) and diabetes mellitus (DM) status (p=0.037) for ΔCACS/y and 
      ACI at baseline (p=0.017) and hypertension (HT) status (p= 0.046) for ΔACI/y were 
      significant independent predictors. Furthermore, annualized RPVI variation was 
      significantly related to both ΔCACS/y and ΔACI/y (R=-0.565, p＜0.001, and R=-0.289, 
      p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, independent contributions of the 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and annualized eGFR variation to VC 
      progression were not confirmed. CONCLUSION: The degree of VC at baseline, DM, HT, 
      and changes in renal volume, but not eGFR, had a strong impact on VC progression in 
      patients with CKD.

PG  - 342-5
LID - 10.1159/000232941 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and cardiovascular events are common in 
      hemodialysis patients. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) 
      plays an important role in vascular calcification and bone remodeling. This study 
      investigates the effects of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) on cardiovascular events in 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Serum sRANKL levels of 47 patients were tested by 
      ELISA. Vascular calcification was radiographically measured and patients were 
      followed up for 2 years. RESULTS: After 2 years, 10 (36.6%) patients had experienced 
      cardiovascular events. Seventy-five percent (6/9) of mortality was due to 
      cardiovascular disease. Patients experiencing cardiovascular events showed 
      significantly higher vascular calcification scores (VCS) (3.20 +/- 2.74 vs. 1.19 +/- 
      1.60; t = 2.999; p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum 
      sRANKL levels, vascular calcification scores and phosphorus were independent 
      determinants of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Serum sRANKL levels and VCS are 
      independent risk factors, and hemodialysis patients with low serum sRANKL levels 
      have a risk of cardiovascular events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) patients have heavy calcium deposits in their stenotic 
      coronary arteries and worse post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prognoses 
      than those who do not undergo HD. Rotational atherectomy (RA) facilitates PCI 
      success in severely calcified lesions. We aimed to identify clinical and procedural 
      characteristics that predict HD patients' long-term prognoses after PCI that 
      included RA in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era. METHODS: This study included 302 
      patients who underwent regular HD from J2T Multicenter Registry database of 1090 
      consecutive patients who underwent RA to treat de novo calcified lesions at three 
      university hospitals between 2004 and 2015. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular 
      (CV) death. RESULTS: During the 5-year observation period, 59 CV deaths (19.5%) 
      occurred. The CV death group and non-CV death group had comparable profiles except 
      significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher brain natriuretic 
      peptide (BNP), lower rate of RA burr upsizing, and lower rate of final thrombolysis 
      in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow achievement in the CV death group. Cox 
      regression analysis revealed that increasing ablation burr size (hazard ratio [HR]: 
      0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.81), final TIMI 3 flow (HR: 0.07; 95% CI: 
      0.02-0.28), lower BNP level, and optimal medication were independently associated 
      with better CV mortality in HD patients. CONCLUSION: In the DES era, oral 
      medications at the time of PCI and stepwise calcium ablation were associated with 
      improved long-term CV mortality in HD patients who are scheduled to undergo RA to 
      treat severely calcified coronary artery stenoses, as therapeutic strategies.

AB  - AIM: The aim of our study was to examine the associations between vascular 
      calcification, arterial stiffness and bone mineral density (BMD) in chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: The study subjects were 83 (70 men and 13 
      women) HD patients. All patients had computed tomography (CT) to determine aortic 
      calcification index (ACI), pulse wave velocity (PWV) using a volume-plethysmographic 
      apparatus, and BMD estimated by digital image processing (DIP). RESULTS: Patients, 
      84.3% male, 38.6% diabetic, had a mean age of 59.3 +/- 11.2 years. In univariate 
      linear regression analysis, ACI correlated positively with age (r = 0.586, P < 
      0.0001), dialysis vintage (r = 0.47, P = 0.002), pulse pressure (r = 0.311, P = 
      0.004), C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.226, P = 0.0397) and PWV (r = 0.422, P < 
      0.0001). There was no significant association between ACI and serum markers of 
      mineral metabolism. There was also a positive association between PWV and systolic 
      blood pressure (P = 0.0004) or pulse pressure (P < 0.0001), and a trend towards 
      greater PWV with increasing age (r = 0.494). In multivariate regression analysis 
      only increasing age, pulse pressure, serum levels of albumin and CRP were 
      significantly associated with ACI and PWV. Mean BMD on DIP was 2.7 +/- 0.4 mmAL. ACI 
      was inversely correlated with BMD (r = -0.234, P = 0.0331). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular 
      calcification is closely associated with arterial stiffness in HD patients. BMD is 
      inversely correlated with ACI, suggesting that measurement of hand BMD by DIP is a 
      useful tool for assessment of renal bone disease in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) often fail to mature, but the mechanism of 
      AVF nonmaturation is poorly understood. Arterial microcalcification is common in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may limit vascular dilatation, 
      thereby contributing to early postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis and 
      impaired AVF maturation. This study evaluated whether preexisting arterial 
      microcalcification adversely affects AVF outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. 
      SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 127 patients with CKD undergoing AVF surgery at a large 
      academic medical center. PREDICTORS: Preexisting arterial microcalcification (≥1% of 
      media area) assessed independently by von Kossa stains of arterial specimens 
      obtained during AVF surgery and by preoperative ultrasound. OUTCOMES: 
      Juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis (ascertained by ultrasound obtained 4-6 weeks 
      postoperatively), AVF nonmaturation (inability to cannulate with 2 needles with 
      dialysis blood flow ≥ 300mL/min for ≥6 sessions in 1 month within 6 months of AVF 
      creation), and duration of primary unassisted AVF survival after successful use 
      (time to first intervention). RESULTS: Arterial microcalcification was present by 
      histologic evaluation in 40% of patients undergoing AVF surgery. The frequency of a 
      postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis was similar in patients with or without 
      preexisting arterial microcalcification (32% vs 42%; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28-1.52; 
      P=0.3). AVF nonmaturation was observed in 29%, 33%, 33%, and 33% of patients 
      with <1%, 1% to 4.9%, 5% to 9.9%, and ≥10% arterial microcalcification, respectively 
      (P=0.9). Sonographic arterial microcalcification was found in 39% of patients and 
      was associated with histologic calcification (P=0.001), but did not predict AVF 
      nonmaturation. Finally, among AVFs that matured, unassisted AVF maturation (time to 
      first intervention) was similar for patients with and without preexisting arterial 
      microcalcification (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21; P=0.2). LIMITATIONS: Single-center 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial microcalcification is common in patients with advanced 
      CKD, but does not explain postoperative AVF stenosis, AVF nonmaturation, or AVF 
      failure after successful cannulation.

LID - 10.2215/CJN.11191111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is associated with increased 
      cardiovascular mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients. This prospective study 
      investigated the relationship between serum osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of 
      NF-κB ligand, inflammatory markers, and progression of coronary artery calcification 
      score. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Seventy-eight hemodialysis 
      patients were enrolled. Serum IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, osteoprotegerin, receptor 
      activator of NF-κB, fetuin A, and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured by ELISA. 
      Coronary artery calcification score was measured two times with 1-year intervals, 
      and patients were classified as progressive or nonprogressive. RESULTS: Baseline and 
      first-year serum osteoprotegerin levels were significantly higher in the progressive 
      than nonprogressive group (17.39±9.67 versus 12.90±6.59 pmol/L, P=0.02; 35.17±18.35 
      versus 24±11.65 pmol/L, P=0.002, respectively). The ratio of serum osteoprotegerin 
      to receptor activator of NF-κB ligand at 1 year was significantly higher in the 
      progressive group (0.26 [0.15-0.46] versus 0.18 [0.12-0.28], P=0.004). Serum 
      osteoprotegerin levels were significantly correlated with coronary artery 
      calcification score at both baseline (r=0.36, P=0.001) and 1 year (r=0.36, P=0.001). 
      Importantly, progression in coronary artery calcification score significantly 
      correlated with change in serum osteoprotegerin levels (r=0.39, P=0.001). In 
      addition, serum receptor activator of NF-κB ligand levels were significantly 
      inversely correlated with coronary artery calcification scores at both baseline 
      (r=-0.29, P=0.01) and 1 year (r=-0.29, P=0.001). In linear regression analysis for 
      predicting coronary artery calcification score progression, only baseline coronary 
      artery calcification score and change in osteoprotegerin were retained as 
      significant factors in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline coronary artery 
      calcification score and serum osteoprotegerin levels were significantly associated 
      with progression of coronary artery calcification score in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Impact of Indoxyl Sulfate on Coronary Plaques in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 489-496
LID - 10.1536/ihj.17-351 [doi]
AB  - Serum indoxyl sulfate (IS; a uremic toxin) levels, which are significantly higher in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease, including those undergoing hemodialysis, than 
      in the robust, are associated with both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related 
      mortality. Furthermore, coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to 
      interpret the association between serum IS levels and coronary plaque burden (CPB) 
      or CAC.A total of 30 consecutive patients on hemodialysis, who underwent 320-row 
      coronary multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography for suspected coronary 
      artery disease, were enrolled in this prospective study. Coronary artery percent 
      atheroma volume (a CPB marker) and percent calcium volume (a CAC marker) assessed 
      using MDCT were evaluated. Furthermore, various oxidative and inflammatory markers 
      typified by serum IS levels at a dialysis-free day were measured. Using these data, 
      we investigated correlation between the inflammatory marker IS and CPB or 
      CAC.Multivariable analysis indicated that serum IS levels were positively correlated 
      with CAC [partial regression coefficient, 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      0.35-5.43; P = 0.03] but not with CPB, even after adjustment for cofounders. 
      Composite cardiovascular events, namely, as all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction, disabling stroke, and hospital admission for other cardiovascular 
      events, were reported to be 50% in all patients (95% CI, 32.1-67.9).In patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis, serum IS levels were significantly associated with CAC but 
      not with CPB.

TI  - Association between Dietary Intake and Coronary Artery Calcification in Non-Dialysis 
      Chronic Kidney Disease: The PROGREDIR Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu10030372 [doi]
LID - 372
AB  - Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a widespread condition in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Diet may play an important role in CAC, but this role is not clear. 
      This study evaluated the association between macro-and micronutrient intakes and CAC 
      in non-dialysis CKD patients. We analyzed the baseline data from 454 participants of 
      the PROGREDIR study. Dietary intake was evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. 
      CAC was measured by computed tomography. After exclusion of participants with a 
      coronary stent, 373 people remained for the analyses. The highest tertile of CAC was 
      directly associated with the intake of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. There was 
      a higher intake of pantothenic acid and potassium in the second tertile. After 
      adjustments for confounding variables, the intake of pantothenic acid, phosphorus, 
      calcium and potassium remained associated with CAC in the generalized linear mixed 
      models. In order to handle the collinearity between these nutrients, we used the 
      LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression to evaluate the 
      nutrients associated with CAC variability. In this approach, the nutrients that most 
      explained the variance of CAC were phosphorus, calcium and potassium. Prospective 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess the role of interventions 
      regarding these micronutrients on CAC prevention and progression.

TI  - Relationship between serum sclerostin, vascular sclerostin expression and vascular 
      calcification assessed by different methods in ESRD patients eligible for renal 
      transplantation: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 311-323
LID - 10.1007/s11255-018-2033-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification (VC) is known to be prevalent in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Sclerostin has been identified to be involved in the 
      cross-talk between the kidney, vasculature, and bone. The aims of the present study 
      were to evaluate vessel sclerostin expression and its correlation with VC, as well 
      as serum sclerostin levels. METHODS: A total of 51 adult ESRD patients undergoing 
      living donor renal transplant (RT) were enrolled in this study. Serum sclerostin 
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The thoracic aorta 
      calcification (TAC) was measured by computed tomography (CT). The aortic 
      calcification area index (ACAI) was used to evaluate the severity of TAC. During the 
      RT surgery, the internal iliac arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded in 40 
      patients, followed by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression and von 
      Kossa-staining for vascular medial calcification degree. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      rate of TAC detected by CT was 58.82%. The positive rates of the internal iliac 
      arterial calcification and vessel sclerostin expression were both 45%. Vessel 
      sclerostin was strongly co-localized with medial calcification. Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that only serum sclerostin was significantly associated with the 
      presence of TAC, the severity of TAC and the positive expression of vessel 
      sclerostin. Kappa test showed that the consistency of the two different 
      calcification assessment methods, as well as the consistency of vessel sclerostin 
      expression and von Kossa-staining were high. Furthermore, the cutoff points of serum 
      sclerostin for vessel sclerostin expression, the presence of VC evaluated by CT and 
      that evaluated by pathology were 1599.92 pg/mL, 2475.52 pg/mL, and 2116.23 pg/mL, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two methods, namely CT and pathology, to evaluate VC 
      were highly consistent. Serum sclerostin was an independent determinant of positive 
      expression of vessel sclerostin and VC in ESRD patients eligible for RT.

      arteriolopathy .
PG  - 48-51
LID - 10.5414/CN109470 [doi]
AB  - The current case report describes a chronic hemodialysis patient presenting with 
      painful penile ulceration that was clinically and histologically proven to be 
      related to calcific uremic arteriolopathy. The patient subsequently developed severe 
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was both endoscopically and histologically 
      shown to be due to acute esophageal necrosis (AEN), also known as necrotizing 
      esophagitis and "black esophagus". AEN is a rare condition characterized by diffuse 
      necrosis of the esophageal mucosa. The condition is diagnosed endoscopically with 
      demonstration of circumferential mucosal necrosis involving the distal esophagus 
      that can extend proximally. Mortality rates for both calcific uremic ateriolopathy 
      and acute esophageal necrosis are high. Management of both conditions is reviewed. 
      The patient recovered from the acute illness, but expired 6 months later due to 
      progressive failure to thrive. To our knowledge, AEN has not previously been 
      described secondary to calcific uremic arteriolopathy. .

TI  - Microcalcification in the arterial wall and its relationship to the ultrasound 
      criteria of maturation of the arteriovenous fistula.
PG  - 46-51
LID - 10.1177/1129729818775359 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A functioning and reliable arteriovenous fistula is a lifeline for 
      individuals suffering from chronic kidney disease. The success and failure to 
      arteriovenous fistula maturation have been frequently related to patient and surgeon 
      factors. METHOD: In total, 138 participants with stage IV and V chronic kidney 
      disease were included in this prospective observational study. Preoperative vascular 
      mapping using ultrasound was performed to evaluate the condition and size of the 
      vessels to fulfil the inclusion criteria. Intraoperatively, the vessel size was 
      measured prior to anastomosis under magnified view. A specimen from the arterial 
      wall of 5 mm in diameter was obtained from the arterotomy for histopathology 
      assessment. Arteriovenous maturation was assessed at 6 weeks with the guidance of 
      the ultrasound criteria of rule of sixes. RESULTS: From the total of 138 
      participants, 110 participants (79.7%) had matured arteriovenous fistula in 6 weeks. 
      The mean size of the artery measured intraoperatively was 3.82 ± 1.33 mm and the 
      vein was 4.05 ± 1.20 mm. Microcalcification in the arterial media which was 
      hypothesised to be the cause of the arteriovenous fistula failure was insignificant, 
      with a p value of 0.115. Despite having atherosclerosis in the artery, 83.3% of the 
      arteriovenous fistula matured. CONCLUSION: Microcalcification and atherosclerosis 
      are frequently seen in the arteries of chronic kidney disease patients, but they do 
      not explain arteriovenous fistula non-maturation.

TI  - First-time-in-human randomized clinical trial in healthy volunteers and

AB  - AIMS: SNF472 is a calcification inhibitor being developed for the treatment of 
      cardiovascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) and in calciphylaxis patients. 
      This study investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      intravenous (IV) SNF472 in healthy volunteers (HV) and HD patients. METHODS: This is 
      a first-time-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I study to 
      assess the safety, tolerability and PK of SNF472 after ascending single IV doses in 
      HV and a single IV dose in HD patients. A pharmacodynamic analysis was performed to 
      assess the capability of IV SNF472 to inhibit hydroxyapatite formation. RESULTS: 
      Twenty HV and eight HD patients were enrolled. The starting dose in HV was 
      0.5 mg kg(-1) and the dose ascended to 12.5 mg kg(-1) . The dose selected for HD 
      patients was 9 mg kg(-1) . Safety analyses support the safety and tolerability of IV 
      SNF472 in HD patients and HV. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in 
      intensity. No clinically significant effects were observed on vital signs or 
      laboratory tests. PK results were similar in HD patients and HV and indicate a lack 
      of significant dialysability. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated that SNF472 
      administration reduced hydroxyapatite crystallization potential in HD patients who 
      received IV SNF472 9 mg kg(-1) by 80.0 ± 2.4% (mean ± standard error of the mean, 
      95% CI, 75.3-84.8) compared to placebo (8.7 ± 21.0%, P < 0.001, 95% CI, -32.4 to 
      49.7). CONCLUSION: The results from this study showed acceptable safety and 
      tolerability, and lack of significant dialysability of IV SNF472. It is a potential 
      novel treatment for cardiovascular calcification in end-stage renal disease and 
      calciphylaxis warranting further human studies.

AB  - Presence and severity of cardiovascular calcifications strongly predict 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. This multicenter, 
      cross-sectional study primarily aimed to determine prevalence of abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) detected by plain lateral abdominal radiograph, and secondarily 
      aimed to assess predictive factors for AAC. Patients (N = 1500), aged 18-70 years, 
      with CKD stages 3-5D for ≥3 months prior to evaluation, were enrolled at 24 study 
      centers in Thailand; 54.3% were non-dialysis patients. The prevalence of AAC was 
      70.6% and 70.8% in non-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively. Patient's 
      advanced age and widening pulse pressure were identified as predictive factors for 
      AAC ≥ 5 in non-dialysis patients, while patient's age, history of coronary heart 
      disease or diabetes, longer dialysis vintage, and increasing corrected serum calcium 
      or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were identified as such in dialysis patients. 
      With additional regression having covariates in binary, corrected serum calcium ≥9.5 
      mg/dL gave an OR 1.974 (95% CI: 1.324-2.943) for AAC ≥ 5 among the dialysis 
      patients. AAC in diabetes subgroup (N = 692) was additionally evaluated and found 
      that it was prevalent at 84.7% with increased phosphorus as predictive factor (OR, 
      1.178; 95% CI: 1.032-1.344) and 1,25 (OH)(2) vitamin D as protective factor (OR, 
      0.983; 95% CI, 0.970-0.996). The prevalence of AAC in the Thai CKD population is 
      lower than that reported in the literature, and yet the burden is prominent in 
      patients coexisting with diabetes. Variable relationships identified in this study 
      may guide preventive measures against cardiovascular complications in CKD patients.

TI  - Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1758-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard for 
      evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less 
      costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries 
      has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome 
      predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in 
      predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance 
      hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. METHODS: Four 
      hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic 
      radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the 
      methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were 
      followed prospectively for 5 years. RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with 
      the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT 
      (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher 
      prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and 
      eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, 
      whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function 
      and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 
      as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, 
      whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all 
      three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, 
      whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. 
      Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, 
      serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but 
      not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients. CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting 
      mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has peculiar 
      characteristics. The aim of this study was to analyze atherosclerosis, vascular 
      calcification and nitration in arteries from CKD patients. METHODS: External iliac 
      and renal artery segments from 27 stage 5 CKD patients and 25 donor controls, 
      respectively, were collected during the transplantation procedure. RESULTS: CKD 
      patients presented a significantly higher degree of lesion. In a large proportion 
      (72%) of CKD patients, we observed vascular calcifications. Immunohistochemistry for 
      nitrotyrosine revealed a significant increase in nitrotyrosine production in 
      arteries from CKD patients compared with control donors. In addition, within CKD 
      patients, nitrotyrosine staining was significantly stronger in arteries with media 
      calcification when compared with arteries without media calcification. CONCLUSION: 
      The arteriopathy in the CKD patients appears in an early age and seems to be 
      distinct from the arteriopathy of the general population, especially due to intense 
      calcification and vascular oxidative stress.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and low vitamin D levels are associated with severe vascular 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 419-426
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0236-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major complications 
      of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, which should be 
      prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased risk of VCs and 
      fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and 
      without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the 
      associated risk factors. METHODS: A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were 
      recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney 
      disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected. 
      Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of 
      fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by ≥20 %. In the same radiograph, the 
      length of aortic calcification was also measured. Logistic regression models were 
      applied for evaluating the independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral 
      fractures. RESULTS: In our population VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs 
      (>10 cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 %) than in patients without 
      (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis 
      showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI 2.30-12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 
      2.05, 95 % CI 1.10-3.83) were independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % 
      CI 1.01-1.07) and male gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07-2.90) predicted vertebral 
      fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe 
      VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated 
      with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and 
      associated with older age and male gender.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the most appropriate technique to diagnose 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. This is primarily because of the 
      absence of direct comparisons of predictive values of the various calcification 
      scores, especially outside the coronary vascular beds, to detect clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: We included 93 haemodialysis patients and performed 6 vascular 
      calcification scores: two scores utilised simple X-rays of abdominal aorta and 
      peripheral vessels. CT scans of the thoracic, upper abdominal and lower abdominal 
      aorta were performed to calculate the aortic calcification index and CT of the 
      pelvis for calcification of iliac vessels. Patients were followed for 63months (mean 
      46.8months) for first major cardiovascular events and mortality. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      cardiovascular events and 28 deaths occurred. Calcification was detected more 
      sensitively in central and peripheral beds using CT scans compared to X-rays 
      (p<0.001). CT scans detected calcification more frequently in distal than proximal 
      vascular beds (p<0.001). Calcification of the pelvic vessels and lower abdominal 
      aorta were most predictive of events including pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
      O.R. 6.5 (95% C.I. 2-22; p=0.001) and O.R. 3 (95% C.I. 1.1-9; p=0.035); new major 
      cardiovascular events H.R. 4.2 (95% C.I. 1.5-11; p=0.006) and H.R. 2 (95% C.I. 
      0.8-5.3; p=0.1) as well as mortality H.R. 2.8 (95% C.I. 1.3-6; p=0.01) and H.R. 2.2 
      (95% C.I. 1.04-5; p=0.04) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CT based techniques are more 
      sensitive than plain X-rays at detecting peripheral and aortic vascular 
      calcifications. Distal CT scans of the aorta and pelvic vessels have the highest 
      predictive value for cardiovascular events and mortality.

TI  - Correlations of Plasma Desphosphorylated Uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein with 
      Vascular Calcification and Vascular Stiffness in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 167-172
LID - 10.1159/000453368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification 
      and needs vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. High levels of 
      desphosphorylated uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) were significantly associated with 
      vitamin K deficiency and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to explore 
      the correlations of plasma dp-ucMGP with vascular calcification and vascular 
      stiffness in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study enrolled 83 CKD stages 3-5 patients. Vascular calcification score was 
      determined by calcific lesions in the abdominal aorta (AAC) shown by lateral lumbar 
      film; vascular stiffness was assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and 
      pulse wave velocity, while plasma dp-ucMGP levels were measured using ELISA method. 
      Multivariate regression analyses were used to select factors that were independently 
      associated with vascular calcification and vascular stiffness. RESULTS: The mean age 
      was 62.9 ± 13.9 years. CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 constituted 51.8, 13.3, and 34.9%, 
      respectively. The median of plasma dp-ucMGP levels in CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 were 
      586 (452-888), 870 (594-1,591), and 1,050 (518-1,298) pmol/L, respectively. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification (AAC score ≥1) was 63.4% and that of vascular 
      stiffness (CAVI ≥9) was 46.3%. Vascular calcification was correlated with vascular 
      stiffness (r2 = 0.50, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis models 
      to predict vascular calcification showed that age and plasma dp-ucMGP levels were 
      significantly correlated with vascular calcification (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.33; p < 
      0.001 and OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.001-1.004; p = 0.004, respectively). In contrast, there 
      was no association between plasma dp-ucMGP levels and vascular stiffness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Plasma dp-ucMGP levels increase according to the severity of CKD. 
      Plasma dp-ucMGP was positively associated with vascular calcification and might be 
      utilized as an early marker for vascular calcification in CKD patients.

TI  - Mismatch between stiffness in elastic and muscular arteries as a predictor of 
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 375-382
LID - 10.1007/s40520-017-0787-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is one of the risk factors for arterial stiffness 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that a mismatch between 
      elastic and muscular arteries, represented as pulse wave velocity (PWV) ratio, could 
      depict the extent of vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease. We also 
      aimed to compare the predictive PWV ratio value to other factors possibly related to 
      vascular calcification in dialysis population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, in 60 chronic dialysis patients without previous cerebrovascular events, 
      cardiovascular disease and events or clinically evident peripheral artery disease 
      (ankle-brachial index >0.9), carotid-femoral and carotid-radial PWV as well as 
      central hemodynamic parameters were measured by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor). 
      The PWV ratio using carotid-femoral PWV divided by carotid-radial PWV was 
      calculated. Each patient underwent blood tests and chest X-ray for aortic arch 
      calcification scoring. Two experienced radiologists blinded to patient's medical 
      data evaluated chest X-rays (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.76) and calculated how many 
      sectors were calcified (Ogawa et al. in Hemodial Int 13:301-306, 2009). Differently 
      scored chest X-rays were repeatedly reviewed and a consensus was reached. RESULTS: 
      The study population consisted of 31 (51.7%) males and 29 (48.3%) females, mean age 
      52.73 ± 13.76 years. Increased risk for aortic arch calcification was associated 
      with higher PWV ratio even after adjustment for age, height, heart rate, ferritin 
      level and C-reactive protein level (OR 2.59E+04, 95% CI 2.43E+01, 2.65E+09, 
      p = 0.021). PWV ratio together with above-mentioned variables could predict the 
      presence of aortic arch calcification with specificity of 93% (95% CI 78, 99%) and 
      sensitivity of 53% (95% CI 34, 72%). CONCLUSION: The elastic and muscular arteries' 
      stiffness mismatch was strongly associated with the extent of aortic arch 
      calcification in this dialysis population and had better calcification predictive 
      value compared to other demographic, hemodynamic and biochemical markers.

AB  - The prognostic performance of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for predicting 
      adverse outcomes in patients with decreased renal function remains unclear. We aimed 
      to examine whether CACS improves risk stratification by demonstrating incremental 
      value beyond a traditional risk score according to renal function status. 9,563 
      individuals without known coronary artery disease were enrolled. Estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was ascertained using the 
      modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, and was categorized as: ≥90, 
      60 to 89, and <60. CACS was categorized as 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400. 
      Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comprising 
      all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and late revascularization (>90 days). 
      Mean age was 55.8 ± 11.5 years (52.8% male). In total, 261 (2.7%) patients 
      experienced MACE over a median follow-up of 24.5 months (interquartile range: 16.9 
      to 41.1). Incident MACE increased with higher CACS across each eGFR category, with 
      the highest rate observed among patients with CACS >400 and eGFR <60 (95.1 per 1,000 
      person-years). A CACS >400 increased MACE risk with HR 4.46 (95% CI 1.68 to 11.85), 
      6.63 (95% CI 4.03 to 10.92), and 6.14 (95% CI 2.85 to 13.21) for eGFR ≥90, 60 to 89, 
      and <60, respectively, as compared with CACS 0. Further, CACS improved 
      discrimination and reclassification beyond Framingham 10-year risk score (FRS) (AUC: 
      0.70 vs 0.64; category free-NRI: 0.51, all p <0.001) for predicting MACE in patients 
      with impaired renal function (eGFR < 90). In conclusion, CACS improved risk 
      stratification and provided incremental value beyond FRS for predicting MACE, 
      irrespective of eGFR status.

TI  - Skin autofluorescence associates with vascular calcification in chronic kidney

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between tissue advanced 
      glycation end products, as reflected by skin autofluorescence, and vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Three hundred 
      patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease underwent multislice computed 
      tomography to estimate total coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and had tissue 
      advanced glycation end product assessed using a skin autofluorescence reader. Intact 
      parathyroid hormone (P<0.001) displaced estimated glomerular filtration rate as 
      third most significant factor associated with skin autofluorescence after age 
      (P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (P<0.001) in multiple regression analysis. On 
      univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, every 1-U increase in skin 
      autofluorescence was associated with a 7.43-fold (95% confidence intervals, 
      3.59-15.37; P<0.001) increased odds of having CACS ≥400 compared with those with 
      zero CACS. Skin autofluorescence retained significance in predicting CACS ≥400 (odds 
      ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.44-9.18; P=0.006) when adjusting for age, 
      sex, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, C-reactive protein, lipids, blood pressure, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intact parathyroid hormone but marginally 
      lost significance when additionally adjusting for diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 
      2.23; 95% confidence intervals, 0.81-6.14; P=0.1). Combination of diabetes mellitus 
      and higher intact parathyroid hormone was associated with greater skin 
      autofluorescence and CACS versus those without diabetes mellitus and having lower 
      intact parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue advanced glycation end product, as 
      reflected by skin autofluorescence, showed a significant novel association with 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. These data suggest that increased 
      tissue advanced glycation end product may contribute to vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and warrant further experimental 
      investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) and intradialytic hypotension (IDH) indicate 
      morphological and functional disorders of the cardiovascular system in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes 
      remain undetermined. METHODS: HD patients (n=443) whose plain chest radiographs were 
      examined for aortic arch VC were included. IDH was defined as nadir systolic blood 
      pressure <90mmHg or need for bolus fluid. We investigated the relationship between 
      VC and IDH, and their clinical significance for cardiovascular events (CVEs) and 
      death. RESULTS: VC was found in 57 HD patients (12.9%). IDH was more prevalent in 
      patients with VC compared with those without VC (35.1% vs. 18.7%; P=0.004). VC was 
      independently associated with a 2.12-fold increase in the risk of IDH (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.36). In multivariate analysis, compared with 
      patients with neither VC nor IDH, the coexistence of VC and IDH was independently 
      associated with death (hazard ratio [HR], 3.83; 95% CI, 1.62-9.08) and CVE (HR, 
      3.77; 95% CI, 1.53-9.33), whereas VC or IDH alone was not. Patients with both VC and 
      IDH had the highest risk for a composite event (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.79-7.08). 
      Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and IDH (P for 
      interaction=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: VC was independently associated with IDH. 
      Coexistence of VC and IDH was associated with higher risk of death and CVEs than 
      either factor alone. There was a synergistic interaction between VC and IDH for the 
      risk of a composite event.

AB  - Abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) has been associated with clinical outcomes in 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Heart rhythm complexity analysis has been shown 
      to be a promising tool to predict outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. 
      In this study, we aimed to analyze the association between heart rhythm complexity 
      and AAC in PD patients. We prospectively analyzed 133 PD patients. Heart rhythm 
      complexity including detrended fluctuation analysis and multiscale entropy was 
      performed. In linear analysis, the patients in the higher AAC group (AAC ≥15%) had a 
      significantly lower standard deviation of normal RR intervals, very low frequency, 
      low frequency, high frequency and low/high frequency ratio. In non-linear analysis, 
      DFAα1, slope 1-5, scale 5 and area 6-20 were significantly lower in the patients 
      with higher AAC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that DFAα1 
      had the greatest discriminatory power to differentiate these two groups. 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that DFAα1 and HbA1c were 
      significantly associated with higher AAC ratio. Adding DFAα1 significantly improved 
      the discriminatory power of the linear parameters in both net reclassification 
      improvement and integrated discrimination improvement models. In conclusion, DFAα1 
      is highly associated with AAC and a potential cardiovascular marker in PD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and associated 
      factors of carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 309 panoramic 
      radiographs of patients with CKD (180 men and 129 women; mean age 43.7 years) 
      undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated by a single radiologist to determine the 
      frequency of CAC. An analysis of associated factors, such as age, sex, time spent in 
      hemodialysis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, biochemical parameters, and 
      other systemic diseases, was also performed. RESULTS: The presence of CAC in 
      patients with CKD, as determined on the basis of panoramic radiography, was 15.9%. 
      The χ(2) test revealed that there was a statistically significant association 
      between certain factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, and the presence 
      of CAC (P < .05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that time spent in hemodialysis 
      was significantly associated with the occurrence of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant 
      presence of CAC was detected on digital panoramic radiographs in patients with CKD 
      undergoing hemodialysis. Calcification was more frequent in older patients, women, 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus, and patients who had undergone hemodialysis for 
      longer periods.

TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1543-3 [doi]
LID - 345
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from 
      cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play 
      a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify 
      CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe 
      hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 
      2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and 
      clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were 
      analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 
      patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 
      AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of 
      patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In 
      univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total 
      cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely 
      correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In 
      multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that 
      CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral 
      neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with 
      Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

TI  - Low serum butyrylcholinesterase is independently related to low fetuin-A in patients 
      on hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1713-1720
LID - 10.1007/s11255-018-1957-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fetuin-A, which plays a protective role against the atherosclerosis and 
      progression of vascular calcification, is decreased in patients on hemodialysis 
      (HD). Fetuin-A and serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) levels decrease during 
      malnutrition. We explored whether BChE was independently related to fetuin-A in 
      patients on HD. METHODS: Laboratory data including BChE and serum fetuin-A were 
      acquired from 230 patients on HD between August 2017 and April 2018. Nutritional 
      status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Abdominal 
      aortic calcification index (ACI) was measured using computed tomography. Patients 
      were stratified into two groups: low fetuin-A (< lowest quartile) and non-low 
      fetuin-A (≥ lowest quartile) groups. Patient background, medication, and laboratory 
      data were compared. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to 
      determine the optimal cutoff values of BChE and GNRI for lower fetuin-A level. 
      Factors independently related with lower fetuin-A levels were determined using 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The lowest quartile value of 
      fetuin-A and optimal cutoff values of BChE and GNRI were 0.213 g/L, 200 IU/L, and 
      92.6, respectively. The study included 57 and 173 patients in the low fetuin-A and 
      non-low fetuin-A groups, respectively. Significant between-group differences were 
      observed for age, C-reactive protein (CRP), history of cardiovascular disease, serum 
      albumin, GNRI, and BChE. Multivariate analysis showed that BChE of < 200 IU/L [odds 
      ratio (OR) 3.05], CRP (OR 2.49), and GNRI of < 92.6 (OR 2.34) were independent 
      factors for lower fetuin-A level after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: BChE 
      was a significant independent marker for fetuin-A levels in patients on HD, in 
      addition to GNRI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mineral and bone disorders associated to chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) 
      are a daily challenge for pediatric nephrologists, with a significant risk of 
      long-term bone and vascular comorbidities. METHODS: This single-center study is a 
      prospective transversal evaluation of pediatric CKD patients of our center, part of 
      the European 4C study. In addition to clinical and biochemical data, vascular and 
      bone evaluation was performed: 24-h blood pressure assessment, carotid intima-media 
      thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and high-resolution peripheral 
      quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the ultra-distal tibia. Results are 
      presented as median (range). RESULTS: At a median age of 12.9 years (10.2-17.9), SDS 
      height of - 1.0 (- 3.3-1.2) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
      33 mL/min/1.73m(2) (11-72), 32 patients (8 girls) were evaluated. Median calcium, 
      phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25 OHD3 levels were 2.44 mmol/L 
      (2.24-2.78), 1.43 mmol/L (1.0-2.7), 80 pg/mL (9-359), and 70 nmol/L (32-116), 
      respectively. Bivariate Spearman and backward multivariable analyses showed that 
      calcium and bone trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), were positively associated with 
      diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (both for the 24 h, day and night 
      assessment), whereas PTH and vitamin D did not predict blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We show that the greater the serum levels of calcium, the greater the (diastolic and 
      mean) blood pressure; moreover, the greater the Tb. Th, the greater the (diastolic 
      and mean) blood pressure. The role of calcium supplements to explain such findings 
      in early pediatric CKD can be discussed.

TI  - Aortic Aging in ESRD: Structural, Hemodynamic, and Mortality Implications.
PG  - 1837-46
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2015060617 [doi]
AB  - Aging incurs aortic stiffening and dilation, but these changes are less pronounced 
      in peripheral arteries, resulting in stiffness and geometry gradients influencing 
      progression of the forward and reflected pressure waves. Because premature arterial 
      aging is observed in ESRD, we determined the respective roles of stiffness and 
      aortic geometry gradients in 73 controls and 156 patients on hemodialysis. We 
      measured aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and brachial PWV to evaluate the stiffness 
      gradient [(brachial PWV/aortic PWV)(0.5)] and ascending aortic and aortic 
      bifurcation diameters to assess aortic taper (ascending aortic diameter/aortic 
      bifurcation diameter). The global reflection coefficient was estimated from 
      characteristic impedance and vascular resistance. Cox proportional hazard models 
      were used to determine mortality risk. The age-associated increase in aortic PWV was 
      higher in patients (P<0.001). In controls, aortic ascending and bifurcation 
      diameters increased with age, with an unchanged aortic taper. In patients on 
      hemodialysis, age did not associate with increased ascending aortic diameter but did 
      associate with increased aortic bifurcation diameter and decreased aortic taper, 
      both of which also associated with abdominal aortic calcifications and smaller 
      global reflection coefficient (P<0.001). In patients, multivariate models revealed 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with age, aortic PWV, and aortic 
      bifurcation diameter with high specificity and sensitivity. Using stiffness 
      gradient, aortic taper, or global reflection coefficient in the model produced 
      similar results. Thus, whereas aortic stiffness is a known independent predictor of 
      mortality, these results indicate the importance of also evaluating the aortic 
      geometry in patients on hemodialysis.

TI  - [Is the Sodium Thiosulfate Therapy useful for vascular calcification in dialysis 
      Pts?].
LID - gin/32.3.6 [pii]
AB  - Vascular calcifications in uremic patients are associated with a significant 
      increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has 
      been shown to reduce the progression of uremic calcifications in haemodialysis 
      patients. In our study we evaluated the effects on evolution of aortic 
      calcifications of the drug infused during the last 2 hours of dialysis sessions at a 
      dose of 10 grams. 18 hemodialysis patients were evaluated as regards the 
      calcifications index according to Kauppila, calcium-phosphorus metabolism, PTH, and 
      oral chelation therapy. The side effects of STS and the symptomatic effects reported 
      by the patient, were also evaluated using a questionnaire delivered to patients. 
      After 6 months of therapy, a modest reduction of the Kauppila's index (from 16.4 5.5 
      to 15.1 4.6) was detected. No significant change was detected in blood tests. Even 
      chelation therapy did not suffer variations. It was also showed a clear and 
      statistically significant improvement in signs and symptoms of leg pain, a moderate 
      improvement of' power reserve and a reduction of muscle fatigue. The results of our 
      study, although preliminary and on a small number of patients, confirm a positive 
      effect of STS on vasculopatic symptoms and progression of vascular calcifications.

TI  - Vascular calcification estimated by aortic calcification area index is a significant 
      predictive parameter of cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 877-83
LID - 10.1007/s10157-011-0517-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a feature of arteriosclerosis. In hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients, vascular calcification progresses rapidly. This study used the aortic 
      calcification area index (ACAI), an index of vascular calcification, to evaluate 
      vascular calcification factors in HD patients, to investigate correlations between 
      ACAI and long-term prognosis and to assess correlations between various factors and 
      long-term prognosis. METHODS: Subjects comprised 137 patients on maintenance HD. 
      ACAI was measured as an index of vascular calcification as measured by abdominal 
      plain computed tomography. The patients were divided into a high ACAI (H) group and 
      a low ACAI (L) group according to whether the ACAI was below or above the mean value 
      (21.4%) of ACAI, and long-term all-cause death and cardiovascular death rates were 
      compared between groups. Risk factors for all-cause death and cardiovascular death 
      were examined by Cox hazard analysis. RESULTS: During follow-up (mean follow-up 
      period 95.3 ± 50.3 months), 76 patients died, including 46 cardiovascular deaths. 
      Deaths included 51 of 70 patients (67.1%) in Group H and 25 of 67 patients (37.3%) 
      in Group L. Cardiovascular death rates were 51.4 and 14.9%, respectively. On 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis, the number of all-cause deaths was significantly higher in 
      Group H (P < 0.001, log-rank test). Similarly, the number of cardiovascular deaths 
      was significantly higher in Group H. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis 
      showed that ACAI (%) was a significant prognostic indicator for cardiovascular death 
      (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.06, P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: High 
      ACAI was clearly correlated with mortality rate in HD patients, particularly 
      cardiovascular mortality rate. ACAI was a useful long-term prognostic indicator in 
      HD patients.

TI  - Impact of BMI on cardiovascular events, renal function, and coronary artery 
      calcification.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1159/000362862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in the 
      general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI on 
      CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease not on 
      dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis initiation, 
      and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. METHODS: CKD patients were 
      divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of dialysis, and 
      extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and multivariable analysis 
      were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD 
      stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, 
      albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour 
      proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 
      years. RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 
      0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not increase 
      the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or 
      multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not 
      increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 
      0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 
      0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to 
      other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 
      95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of 
      CAC extent or progression. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High 
      BMI increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to 
      CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact 
      of high BMI on dialysis initiation.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients with nondialysis CKD over 3 years.
PG  - 654-66

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in CKD, but little 
      is known about its prognostic effect on patients with nondialysis CKD. The 
      prevalence of VC and its ability to predict death, time to hospitalization, and 
      renal progression were assessed. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The 
      Study of Mineral and Bone Disorders in CKD in Spain is a prospective, observational, 
      3-year follow-up study of 742 patients with nondialysis CKD stages 3-5 from 39 
      centers in Spain from April to May 2009. VC was assessed using Adragao (AS; x-ray 
      pelvis and hands) and Kauppila (KS; x-ray lateral lumbar spine) scores from 572 and 
      568 patients, respectively. The primary end point was death. Secondary outcomes were 
      hospital admissions and appearance of a combined renal end point (beginning of 
      dialysis or drop >30% in eGFR). Factors related to VC were assessed by logistic 
      regression analysis. Survival analysis was assessed by Cox proportional models. 
      RESULTS: VC was present in 79% of patients and prominent in 47% (AS≥3 or KS>6). Age 
      (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.07; P<0.001), 
      phosphorous (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.20; P<0.001), and diabetes (OR, 2.11; 95% 
      CI, 1.32 to 3.35; P=0.002) were independently related to AS≥3. After a median 
      follow-up of 35 months (interquartile range=17-36), there were 70 deaths (10%). 
      After multivariate adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes, comorbidity, renal 
      function, and level of phosphorous, AS≥3 but not KS>6 was independently associated 
      with all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.01; P=0.03) and 
      cardiovascular (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.27 to 9.45; P=0.02) mortality as well as a 
      shorter hospitalization event-free period (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.22; P<0.001). 
      VC did not predict renal progression. CONCLUSIONS: VC is highly prevalent in 
      patients with CKD. VC assessment using AS independently predicts death and time to 
      hospitalization. Therefore, it could be a useful index to identify patients with CKD 
      at high risk of death and morbidity as previously reported in patients on dialysis.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification is not superior over other vascular calcification in 
      predicting mortality in hemodialysis patients: a retrospective observational study.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend 
      that a lateral abdominal radiograph should be performed to assess vascular 
      calcification (VC) in dialysis patients. However, abdominal aortic calcification is 
      a prevalent finding, and it remains unclear whether other anatomical areas of VC can 
      predict mortality more accurately. METHODS: A total of 217 maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients were enrolled at the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital between July 2010 
      and March 2011. Radiographs of the abdomen, pelvis and hands were evaluated by a 
      radiologist to evaluate the presence of VC. The correlation between different areas 
      of VC and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality was analyzed using univariate and 
      multivariate models. RESULTS: The prevalence of VC was 70.0% (152 patients), and 
      most had abdominal aortic calcification (90.1%). During 26 ± 7 months of follow-up, 
      37 patients died. The VC score was independently associated with patient mortality. 
      VC observed on abdominal radiographs (abdominal aortic calcification) was associated 
      with all-cause mortality in models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors (HR, 
      4.69; 95%CI, 1.60-13.69) and dialysis factors (HR, 3.38; 95%CI, 1.18-9.69). VC in 
      the pelvis or hands was associated with all-cause mortality in the model adjusted 
      for dialysis factors. When three combinations of VC in different radiographs were 
      included in models, the presence of abdominal VC was only significantly associated 
      with all-cause mortality in the integrated model. VC in the abdomen and pelvis was 
      associated with all-cause mortality in the model adjusted for cardiovascular factors 
      and the integrated model, but neither was significantly associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality. VC in all radiographs was significantly associated with a 
      more than 6-fold risk of all-cause mortality and a more than 5-fold risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality compared to patients without VC. CONCLUSIONS: VC in 
      different arteries as shown on radiographs is associated with different levels of 
      risk for mortality. The lateral abdominal radiograph may not be superior to other 
      radiographs for predicting patient outcomes. Further research is needed to elucidate 
      the effects of difference burdens of VC on patient outcomes.

TI  - Activation of the mTORC1 pathway by inflammation contributes to vascular 
      calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 101-110
LID - 10.1007/s40620-018-0486-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the progression of 
      vascular calcification (VC). This study was designed to explore the effects and 
      underlying mechanisms of inflammation on VC in the radial arteries of patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with arteriovenostomy. METHODS: Forty-eight ESRD 
      patients were divided into control (n = 25) and inflammation groups (n = 23) 
      according to plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Surgically removed tissues from 
      the radial arteries of patients receiving arteriovenostomy were used in this study. 
      Alizarin Red S staining was used to examine calcium deposition. The expression of 
      inflammation markers, bone structure-associated proteins and mammalian target of 
      rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) pathway-related proteins was assessed by 
      immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α 
      (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was increased in the radial 
      arteries of the inflammation group. Additionally, Alizarin Red S staining revealed a 
      marked increase in calcium deposition in the inflammation group compared to 
      controls. Further analysis by immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the 
      deposition was correlated with the increased expression of bone-associated proteins 
      such as bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin and collagen I, which 
      suggested that inflammation induces osteogenic differentiation in vascular tissues 
      and that osteogenic cells are the main cellular components involved in VC. 
      Interestingly, there was a parallel increase in the expression of phosphorylated 
      mTOR (p-mTOR) and pribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p-S6K1) in the inflammation group. 
      Furthermore, mTORC1 pathway-related proteins were significantly associated with the 
      enhanced expression of bone formation biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation 
      contributed to VC in the radial arteries of ESRD patients via the induction of 
      osteogenic differentiation in vessel walls, which could be regulated by the 
      activation of the mTORC1 pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on 
      prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification 
      progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients 
      on HD. METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. 
      Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular 
      blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was 
      evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment 
      ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI 
      values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified 
      into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) 
      and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, 
      comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between 
      ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI 
      progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, 
      respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 
      year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. 
      The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 
      (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic 
      nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were 
      male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the 
      progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to 
      improve progression of aortic calcification in patients on HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Impact of trajectories of abdominal aortic calcification over 2 years on subsequent 
      mortality: a 10-year longitudinal study.
PG  - 676-683
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although both the presence and progression over time of vascular 
      calcification have been shown to independently predict cardiovascular disease and 
      mortality in chronic dialysis patients, the impact of the pattern of accumulation of 
      abdominal aortic calcification on mortality has not yet been investigated. METHODS: 
      We conducted a longitudinal study at a dialysis hospital in Hokkaido, Japan from 
      2005 to 2014. An abdominal calcification index (ACI) was generated for 396 patients 
      from their annual abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. The trajectories of ACIs 
      during the first 2 years were classified using group-based trajectory modeling into 
      four groups; stable (29.0%), slow increase (29.2%), rapid nonlinear increase (24.4%) 
      and advanced with slow increase (17.4%). Incidence rates by group of all-cause 
      mortality during the follow-up period (mean of 4.5 years) were investigated using 
      the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Compared with the stable trajectory, 
      both the rapid nonlinear increase and the advanced with slow increase trajectories 
      were associated with an increased risk of death [adjusted hazard ratios (HR) 1.91; 
      95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-3.58 and adjusted HR 2.79; 95% CI: 1.44-5.11, 
      respectively]. Sensitivity analyses indicated that ACI trajectories were associated 
      with subsequent mortality, while ACI at individual time points was not. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Chronic hemodialysis patients with a trajectory of longitudinal high or rapid 
      accumulation of vascular calcification over time were at a higher risk of death. 
      Individual trajectories of vascular calcification may be suggested to allow for more 
      accurate mortality risk calculations than one-time assessment.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of lanthanum carbonate on chronic kidney disease-mineral and 
      bone disorder in dialysis patients: a systematic review.
PG  - 226
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a common 
      complication in CKD patients, particularly in those with end-stage renal disease 
      that requires dialysis. Lanthanum carbonate (LC) is a potent, non-aluminum, 
      non-calcium phosphate binder. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and 
      safety of LC in CKD-MBD treatment for maintenance-dialysis patients. METHODS: A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
      quasi-RCTs was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of LC in maintenance 
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients. Analysis was performed using the 
      statistical software Review Manager 5.1. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs involving 3789 
      patients were identified and retained for this review. No statistical difference was 
      found in all-cause mortality. The limited number of trials was insufficient to show 
      the superiority of LC over other treatments in lowering vascular calcification or 
      cardiovascular events and in improving bone morphology, bone metabolism, or bone 
      turn-over parameters. LC decreased the serum phosphorus level and calcium × 
      phosphate product (Ca × P) as compared to placebo. LC, calcium carbonate (CC), and 
      sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) were comparable in terms of controlling the serum 
      phosphorus, Ca × P product, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. However, 
      LC resulted in a lower serum calcium level and a higher bone-specific alkaline 
      phosphatase level compared with CC. LC had higher total cholesterol and low-density 
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels compared with SH. LC-treated patients appeared 
      to have a higher rate of vomiting and lower risk of hypercalcemia, diarrhea, 
      intradialytic hypotension, cramps or myalgia, and abdominal pain. Meta-analysis 
      showed no significant difference in the incidence of other side effects. 
      Accumulation of LC in blood and bone was below toxic levels. CONCLUSIONS: LC has 
      high efficacy in lowering serum phosphorus and iPTH levels without increasing the 
      serum calcium. Current evidence does not show a higher rate of adverse effects for 
      LC compared with other treatments, except for a higher incidence of vomiting. 
      Moreover, LC accumulation in blood and bone was below toxic levels. Well-designed 
      studies should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of LC.

TI  - Lower Serum Irisin Levels Are Associated with Increased Vascular Calcification in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1159/000487689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular 
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is prevalent 
      and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex and unclear. 
      We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play roles in vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate serum irisin 
      levels and establish their relation to vascular calcification and other parameters 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 150 patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in 
      this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA. 
      Vascular calcification was evaluated by abdominal aortic calcification scores. 
      RESULTS: Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis 
      patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0) vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, 
      P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively correlated with the parathyroid hormone 
      level (P=0.01). The HD patients with vascular calcification showed significantly 
      lower serum irisin concentrations [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, 
      P<0.01]. Compared with the group without vascular calcification multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were 
      significant independent determinant factors for vascular calcification in HD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Our results are the first to provide a clinical evidence of 
      the association between serum irisin and vascular calcification in HD patients. 
      Lower irisin levels, long-term hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk 
      factors in HD patients.

TI  - Effect Modification of Chronic Kidney Disease on the Association of Circulating and 
      Imaging Cardiac Biomarkers With Outcomes.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.116.005235 [doi]
LID - e005235
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin T and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated in 
      >50% of dialysis patients and are associated with poor outcomes. Few data 
      investigated these associations in earlier chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We studied whether CKD modified associations of elevated BNP, 
      N-terminal-pro-BNP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, coronary artery 
      calcification, and left ventricular hypertrophy with all-cause death and 
      cardiovascular death/events in 3218 multiethnic individuals followed for 12.5 years, 
      and whether biomarkers added prognostic information to traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors in CKD. Of the cohort, 279 (9%) had CKD. There were 296 deaths and 218 
      cardiovascular deaths/events. Of non-CKD individuals, 7% died and 6% had 
      cardiovascular death/event versus 32% and 30% of CKD participants, P<0.001 for both. 
      The interaction between BNP and CKD on death was significant (P=0.01): the adjusted 
      hazard ratio in CKD was 2.05, 95% CI (1.34, 3.14), but not significant in non-CKD, 
      1.04 (0.76, 1.41). CKD modified the association of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 
      T with cardiovascular death/event, adjusted hazard ratio 3.34 (1.56, 7.18) in CKD 
      versus 1.65 (1.16, 2.35) in non-CKD, interaction P=0.09. There was an interaction 
      between N-terminal-pro-BNP and CKD for death in those without prior cardiovascular 
      disease. Addition of each biomarker to traditional risk factors improved risk 
      prediction, except coronary artery calcification was not discriminatory for 
      cardiovascular death/event in CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac biomarkers, with the 
      exception of coronary artery calcification, prognosticated outcomes in early-stage 
      CKD as well as, if not better than, in non-CKD individuals, even after controlling 
      for estimated glomerular filtration rate, and added to information obtained from 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors alone.

AB  - ♦ BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is strongly associated with cardiovascular 
      disease and mortality. However, some factors related to vascular calcification in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain 
      unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of osteoprotegerin (OPG), 
      osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), 
      magnesium, and phosphate clearance with vascular calcification in PD subjects, 
      assessed by plain radiographs. ♦ METHODS: Simple vascular calcification scores 
      (SVCS) obtained from plain X-rays of the pelvis and hands, and the Kauppila Index 
      (KI) from lateral lumbar X-rays were assessed in 76 adults receiving PD for ≥ 6 
      months (43 women, median age 39 years, median time on PD 1.4 years). Levels of OPG, 
      OPN, OCN, and FGF-23 were determined by luminometry. ♦ RESULTS: Serum OPG levels 
      were higher in subjects with vascular calcification (n = 22 with SVCS > 3; n = 19 
      with KI > 7) compared with those with less calcification (p < 0.001). Spearman's 
      correlation coefficients between OPG and SVCS and KI were r = 0.49 and r = 0.51, 
      respectively (both p < 0.001). Subjects with vascular calcification had 
      significantly lower renal phosphate clearance. Multiple regression analysis showed 
      that vascular calcification assessed by SVCS was associated with age (r = 0.2, p = 
      0.042), diabetes mellitus (r = 2.4, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.09, p = 
      0.037), and OPG (r = 0.22, p = 0.001). Vascular calcification assessed by KI was 
      associated with age (r = 0.16, p < 0.001), time on PD (r = 0.54, p = 0.001) and OPG 
      (r = 0.08, p = 0.04). Osteocalcin, OPN, FGF-23, and magnesium were not associated 
      with vascular calcification. ♦ CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of OPG were consistently 
      associated with vascular calcification in subjects on PD.

TI  - Prevalence of vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality in 
      warfarin treated hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 248-58
AB  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization and 
      the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla protein 
      MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 
      387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. 
      Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared 
      with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L 
      vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients 
      had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 
      48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), 
      with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with 
      increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, 
      p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and 
      total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In 
      univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of 
      all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those 
      untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the 
      significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In 
      hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit 
      ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and 
      increased mortality.

TI  - Association between AST-120 and abdominal aortic calcification in predialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1007/s10157-012-0717-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with mortality and cardiovascular 
      events in patients with chronic kidney disease. AST-120, which adsorbs uremic 
      toxins, is reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death in 
      chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate the 
      association between abdominal aortic calcification and the use of AST-120 in 
      predialysis chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted including 199 predialysis chronic kidney disease patients (stages 4 and 5) 
      who underwent abdominal plain computed tomography in our institution between 2005 
      and 2010. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by aortic calcification index 
      (ACI). Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not AST-120 was 
      administered for at least six months, and ACI was compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: The aortic calcification index was significantly lower in patients taking 
      AST-120 [12.2 (2.5-30.3) vs. 25.7 (13.4-45.3) %, P < 0.001]. According to 
      multivariate linear regression analysis, the use of AST-120 was independently and 
      significantly correlated with ACI after adjusting for confounding factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of AST-120 was independently associated with less aortic 
      calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.

TI  - Serum magnesium level and vascular stiffness in children with chronic kidney disease 
      on regular hemodialysis.
PG  - 233-40
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.178205 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this 
      population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple 
      cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, 
      we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness 
      in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children 
      with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children 
      age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured, and Doppler 
      ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the peak systolic 
      velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) 
      arteries were recorded in the study patients. There were significantly lower serum 
      Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the controls (1.7 ± 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 
      ± 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the 
      aorta and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 ± 0.07 mm vs. 
      0.40 ± 0.09 mm; 0.98 ± 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 ± 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, 
      respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding the PSV of 
      the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study patients and the controls 
      (P >0.05). A negative correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT 
      (AIMT) (r = -0.682; P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was 
      found between the AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 
      0.025, 0.472, P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were 
      associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our 
      results warrants further study.

TI  - The predictive value of serum galectin 3 for abdominal aortic calcification in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 212-220
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12825 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heterotopic vascular calcification is a common complication of 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Galectin 3 (Gal-3) has been reported to be 
      associated with cardiovascular calcification. The current study aims to explore the 
      potential predictive value of serum Gal-3 for severe abdominal aortic calcification 
      (AAC) and AAC progression in MHD patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort who 
      underwent hemodialysis during July 2014 at the Blood Purification Center of Ruijin 
      Hospital were followed up for 3 years. Two AAC assessments were performed: one at 
      baseline and one after the 3-year follow-up period. Serum Gal-3 was detected with 
      quantitative ELISA kits. SPSS 23.0 and MedCalc 11.4.2.0 were used to analyze the 
      data. FINDINGS: One hundred and fifty-two patients were recruited. Approximately 
      59.9% were male, the median age was 60 (50-67) years. Logistic regression analysis 
      indicated that serum Gal-3 was an independent risk factor for both follow-up severe 
      AAC and AAC progression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
      revealed significant prognostic value of serum Gal-3 for predicting severe AAC and 
      AAC progression within 3 years. DISCUSSION: We found serum Gal-3 is correlated to 
      vascular calcification in ESRD patients. Gal-3 may be a potential biomarker of 
      vascular calcification for MHD patients.

PG  - 1098-104
AB  - Cardiovascular complications including abdominal aortic calcification significantly 
      affect the mortality and morbidity in patients on a hemodialysis (HD) program. The 
      objective of this study is to find the frequency of abdominal aortic calcification 
      in patients on regular HD and to evaluate the effect of parameters on frequency and 
      severity of abdominal aortic calcification. Fifty-four patients with end-stage renal 
      disease on regular HD were studied from January 2011 to December 2011 to evaluate 
      abdominal aortic calcification by plain abdominal X-ray. The study showed that 10 
      (18.5%) patients had abdominal aortic calcification. Only one (1.9%) had grade 3 
      calcification and among the remaining, five (9.3%) patients had grade 1 and four 
      (7.4%), grade 2. There was a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) in the 
      means of serum cholesterol among those with and without abdominal aortic 
      calcification. Hypertension was noticed in most patients with abdominal aortic 
      calcification. The frequency of abdominal aortic calcification is directly related 
      to age and duration of dialysis. The only biochemical parameter with a statistically 
      significant effect was serum cholesterol.

TI  - Serum S100A12 and Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification Over 4 Years in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 4-13
LID - 10.1159/000438869 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is common and contributes to increased 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this prospective study, 
      we aimed to investigate the associations of serum S100A12 in the presence of severe 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) and the progression of CAC in HD patients. 
      METHODS: Sixty maintenance HD patients and 30 controls were enrolled. Serum S100A12 
      levels were measured using ELISA. CAC scores (CACs) were measured twice at a 4-year 
      interval using multislice spiral CT. The HD patients were classified as rapid 
      progressors or slow progressors according to the change in the CACs across these 2 
      measurements (x0394;CACs). RESULTS: The incidences of rapid progression of CAC in 
      patients with baseline CACs ≤10, CACs >10 and CACs >400 were 12.5, 40.0 and 64.3%, 
      respectively. Both baseline and 4-year serum S100A12 levels were significantly 
      higher in the rapid progressors than in the slow progressors (medians of 45.6 vs. 
      30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001 and 62.3 vs. 39.4 ng/ml, p = 0.002, respectively). The serum 
      S100A12 levels were significantly correlated with baseline CACs (r = 0.466, p < 
      0.001), 4-year CACs (r = 0.440, p < 0.001) and x0394;CACs (r = 0.392, p < 0.001). 
      Importantly, the x0394;CACs were significantly correlated with x0394;S100A12 levels 
      (r = 0.396, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the serum S100A12 
      level was as an independent determinant of the presence of severe CAC and that the 
      increment in the serum S100A12 level was a factor that was significantly 
      independently associated with the progression of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S100A12 
      levels were significantly associated with the presence of severe CAC, and the 
      increment in serum S100A12 levels was an independent determinant of the progression 
      of CAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is observed 
      among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in developed countries, limited 
      information is available about CVD prevalence and risk factors in the Chinese CKD 
      population. The Chinese Cohort of Chronic Kidney Disease (C-STRIDE) was established 
      to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of CVD among Chinese CKD patients. 
      METHODS: Participants with stage 1-4 CKD (18-74 years of age) were recruited at 39 
      clinical centers located in 28 cities from 22 provinces of China. At entry, the 
      socio-demographic status, medical history, anthropometric measurements and lifestyle 
      behaviors were documented, and blood and urine samples were collected. Estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the CKD-EPI creatinine equation. 
      CVD diagnosis was based on patient self-report and review of medical records by 
      trained staff. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the 
      association between risk factors and CVD. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred 
      fifty-nine Chinese patients with pre-stage 5 CKD were enrolled, and 3168 finished 
      all required examinations and were included in the study. In total, 40.8% of the 
      cohort was female, with a mean age of 48.21 ± 13.70 years. The prevalence of CVD was 
      9.8%, and in 69.1% of the CVD cases cerebrovascular disease was observed. 
      Multivariable analysis showed that increasing age, lower eGFR, presence of 
      hypertension, abdominal aorta calcification and diabetes were associated with 
      comorbid CVD among CKD patients. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
      these risk factors were 3.78 (2.55-5.59) for age 45-64 years and 6.07 (3.89-9.47) 
      for age ≥65 years compared with age <45 years; 2.07 (1.28-3.34) for CKD stage 3a, 
      1.66 (1.00-2.62) for stage 3b, and 2.74 (1.72-4.36) for stage 4 compared with stages 
      1 and 2; 2.57 (1.50-4.41) for hypertension, 1.82 (1.23-2.70) for abdominal aorta 
      calcification, and 1.70 (1.30-2.23) for diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      reported the CVD prevalence among a CKD patient cohort and found age, hypertension, 
      diabetes, abdominal aorta calcification and lower eGFR were independently associated 
      with higher CVD prevalence. Prospective follow-up and longitudinal evaluations of 
      CVD risk among CKD patients are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommendations concerning 
      screening for VC differ. Possible ability to prevent and reversibility of VC are 
      major subjects on debate whether screening for VC could improve outcomes of renal 
      patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the significance of simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) based on plane radiographic films and to test 
      its association with non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients on chronic HD. 
      METHODS: A study population consisted of 95 prevalent HD patients in the HD unit of 
      Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health sciences Kaunas Clinics. Clinical data 
      and laboratory tests information were collected from medical records. SVCS was 
      evaluated as it is described by Adragao et al. After measurement of VC, HD patients 
      were observed for novel non-fatal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Patients were 
      divided into two groups: SVCS≥3 (57 patients [60%]) and <3 (38 patients [40%]). The 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a significant difference in non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events in the group with SVCS≥3 vs. <3 group (26.3% vs. 7.8%; log 
      rank 5,49; P=0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed a negative 
      impact of VC, hyperphosphatemia, and lower ejection fraction on cardiovascular 
      events. No statistically significant differences were observed comparing parameters 
      of Ca-P metabolism disorders between groups with different SVCS. On separate 
      analysis, the presence of VC in hands was also associated with higher rate of novel 
      cardiovascular events (score 0 goup-5 events [10.6%] vs. score≥1 group-13 events 
      [27%], log rank P=0.035). CONCLUSION: VC assessed by simple and inexpensive 
      radiological method was an independent predictor of novel non-fatal cardiovascular 
      events in HD patients.

TI  - Association of Soluble TNFR-1 Concentrations with Long-Term Decline in Kidney 
      Function: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 2713-2721
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2018070719 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1), which plays a causative role in endothelial 
      cell dysfunction and inflammation, is expressed on the cell surface in glomerular 
      and peritubular capillary endothelium of the kidneys. Higher soluble TNF receptor-1 
      (sTNFR-1) concentrations are associated with kidney disease progression among 
      persons with established diabetic kidney disease. However, no studies have assessed 
      sTNFR-1's role in long-term kidney function changes in a multiethnic population 
      without cardiovascular disease at baseline. METHODS: We tested associations between 
      baseline sTNFR-1 concentrations and 10-year decline in eGFR (incident ≥40% decline 
      and annual proportional decline) among 2548 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study 
      of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study. Serum creatinine 
      concentrations were determined at enrollment and study years 3, 5, and 10. RESULTS: 
      Mean age of participants was 61 years old, 53% were women, and mean baseline eGFR 
      was 79 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum sTNFR-1 was inversely associated with baseline 
      eGFR. Over median follow-up of 9.3 years, 110 participants developed ≥40% decline in 
      eGFR; each SD higher concentration of sTNFR1 was associated with higher risk of 40% 
      eGFR decline (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 
      1.77; P<0.001). The highest sTNFR-1 tertile was associated with adjusted annualized 
      decline in eGFR of 1.94% (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.09). Associations persisted across 
      subgroups defined by demographics, hypertension, diabetes, and baseline CKD status. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum sTNFR-1 concentrations are associated with faster 
      declines in eGFR over the course of a decade in a multiethnic population, 
      independent of previously known risk factors for kidney disease progression.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of abdominal aortic calcification in healthy living kidney 
      donors.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0485-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common and is both a marker and a cause 
      of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially so in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Renal transplantation is the cornerstone of the successful 
      long-term management of CKD, and in order to satisfy transplantation needs, more use 
      is made now of living kidney donors (LKD). Prior to selection for transplantation, 
      much screening of potential LKD takes place, including for cardiovascular issues. It 
      is not known; however, how much these potentially healthy LKD may be prone to 
      clinically silent VC. METHODS: We identified 103 living kidney donors from 2011 
      renal transplant records. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using 
      existing abdominal CT imaging using multi-channel CT aortograms (used primarily to 
      assess renal vascular anatomy). Using these CT scans, manual calcium scoring was 
      undertaken to calculate total aortic calcium load (AAC severity score). The 
      prevalence, severity and associations of AAC between calcified and non-calcified 
      donors were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 103 donors were identified from 
      records. Ninety three of these had detailed clinical records to complement their CT 
      scans. Fifty of ninety-three donors were male, and the mean age was 45.9 ± 1.8 
      years. Mean MDRD eGFR was 88.73 ± 2.97 ml/min/1.73 m(2). 7.14 ± 3.07 % of the aorta 
      in these donors was calcified with a mean AAC severity score of 0.98 ± 0.56. In 
      kidney donors >50 years of age, there was significantly more AAC than in those <50: 
      2.47 ± 1.56 versus 0.31 ± 0.29, p < 0.001. There was no relationship between the 
      presence or severity of aortic VC and donor GFR, systolic blood pressure, pulse 
      pressure, calcium-phosphate product or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: AAC prevalence, 
      patterns and severity in this important donor population have not previously been 
      described in the literature. There was relatively little VC in what would be 
      regarded as a "healthy" donor population. VC was more common with age, but the other 
      possible risk factors for the presence or severity of VC did not impact on overall 
      AAC scores. VC did not influence vascular stiffness as represented by pulse 
      pressure. Following the evolution of AAC over time in those who have donated a 
      kidney, and lost some global renal function as a consequence, would be of 
      considerable interest.

LID - 10.1159/000350580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Presence and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      indicate severe atherosclerosis and predict cardiovascular events (CVE) in dialysis 
      (ESRD patients) and nondialysis patients (CKD patients). This study aimed at 
      evaluating the prevalence and progression of CAC and CVE in CKD patients with 
      diabetes in whom atherosclerosis of coronary arteries is the leading cause of CVE. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted in both out- and in-patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, stage 2-5. CAC were assessed by the total calcium (TC) 
      score. CT scans were performed at the entry and at the end of the study. RESULTS: 
      Patients (n = 341) were divided into nondiabetic (n = 281) and diabetic patients (n 
      = 60). CAC prevalence and TC score were higher in diabetics and associated with age, 
      diabetes mellitus and pulse pressure. Diabetics with CKD presented a higher 
      percentage of CAC progression and CVE. CONCLUSION: Prevalence, extent, progression 
      of CAC and CVE are higher in diabetics with concomitant CKD. These findings may 
      promote a more aggressive protocol of screening and care in type 2 diabetics with 
      concomitant CKD.

TI  - Prevalence of factors related to vascular calcifications in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease on dialysis.
PG  - 207-213
AB  - The main aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of vascular calcifications 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis in our population assessed by 
      X-ray. The secondary objectives were to determine the cardiovascular risk factors 
      associated with the presence of vascular calcifications and to evaluate the 
      complementary use of the echocardiogram in a cross-sectional, observational, 
      multicentric study. We included patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, 
      age =18 years with at least 3 months of renal replacement therapy in 8 dialysis 
      centres in Argentina. The degree of vascular calcification was determined using 
      Adragao and Kauppila scores. The presence of valvular calcifications was established 
      through a trans-thoracic doppler echocardiogram. Univariate and multivariate 
      analysis were undertaken, considering the degree of vascular calcification as the 
      dependent variable; 443 adult patients were evaluated at 8 centres across 5 
      provinces in Argentina. The prevalence of vascular calcifications by the X-rays was 
      63%, while 73% presented calcifications in hands and pelvis, with an Adragao score > 
      3, and 60% presented calcifications in the abdominal aorta with a Kauppila score > 
      4. The prevalence of valvular calcifications: 28%. We have shown a higher rate of 
      vascular calcifications with the use of plain X-rays when compared to the prevalence 
      of valvular calcifications obtained with echocardiograms. In this regard, valvular 
      calcifications were present particularly in those patients with a severe level of 
      radiological vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mineral and bone disorder (MBD), especially hyperphosphatemia, is an 
      independently risk factor for adverse prognosis in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). However, CKD-MBD among Chinese population was poorly studied. This 
      study aimed to investigate the status of MBD and its association with cardiovascular 
      parameters in Chinese patients with predialysis CKD. METHODS: Chinese Cohort Study 
      of Chronic Kidney Disease (C-STRIDE) is a prospective multicenter cohort study 
      involving predialysis CKD patients in China. Markers of MBD, including serum 
      phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone, were measured in baseline 
      samples at the patients' entry. The association between serum phosphorus and 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were 
      examined by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Altogether 3194 predialysis 
      patients with mean estimated glomerular filtration of 51.8 ± 33.1 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 
      were included. The proportion of patients with hyperphosphatemia were 2.6%, 2.9%, 
      6.8%, and 27.1% in CKD Stages 3a, 3b, 4, and 5, respectively. Moreover, 71.6% of the 
      patients with hyperphosphatemia did not receive any phosphate-binder (PB). Lateral 
      abdominal X-rays were obtained in 2280 patients, 9.8% of the patients were diagnosed 
      as having AAC. Altogether 2219 patients had data of echocardiography, and 13.2% of 
      them were diagnosed with LVH. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
      serum phosphorus was independently associated with the presence of AAC and LVH. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients with CKD, the percentage of hyperphosphatemia is 
      comparable to that of other countries while the usage of PBs is suboptimal. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification in Chinese patients is relatively lower 
      compared with the Caucasian population.

      patients.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease and end 
      stage renal disease. In both the general population and patients with end stage 
      renal disease, vascular calcification is related to arterial stiffness and is a 
      predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various diagnostic methods are 
      currently used to assess vascular calcification. There is a preference for simple, 
      reliable methods that can be used in daily practice. Therefore, several imaging and 
      laboratory methods are investigated. Twenty-eight patients with mean age of 62 years 
      on chronic hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. The mean duration of 
      hemodialysis treatment was 70 months (range 3 to 350 months). Vascular calcification 
      was assessed with coronary computed tomography and lateral lumbar, pelvic and hand 
      radiographs. Vascular stiffness was evaluated using aortic pulse wave velocity and 
      ankle-brachial index measurements, and finally serum levels of fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 were followed. A statistically significant correlation was demonstrated 
      between all the following parameters: coronary artery calcification score, aortic 
      pulse wave velocity, abdominal aortic calcification score, simple vascular 
      calcification scores in pelvis and hand. A statistically significant correlation of 
      ankle-brachial index >1.3 to coronary artery calcification score was found. There 
      was no correlation between the previous parameters and fibroblast growth factor-23. 
      The results of our study indicate that simple imaging methods could provide 
      confident vascular damage assessment and therefore potentially guide therapy 
      adjustments. An association between fibroblast growth factor-23 and the other 
      diagnostic modalities in our study was not found.

AB  - AIM: Vascular stiffness is associated with cardiovascular mortality in dialysis 
      patients and related with vascular calcification and microvascular inflammation. The 
      objective of this study is to compare predictability of two different vascular 
      calcification scoring systems using plain radiographs in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. METHODS: Vascular stiffness was represented by heart-to-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity (hfPWV) in our 79 PD patients. Peripheral vascular calcification score 
      (PVCS) and abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) were measured from plain 
      radiographs. Microvascular inflammation was represented by peritoneal protein 
      clearance (PPC). Regression analysis and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The hfPWV revealed correlation with 
      PVCS and AACS independently. In the ROC curve analysis, area under the curve (AUC) 
      of PVC score was 0.7119 (P = 0.006), and AUC of AACS were 0.6960 (P = 0.011). After 
      multiple linear regression analysis, PVCS remained as a predictor of vascular 
      stiffness (R(2) = 0.579, β = 0.210, P = 0.038). The combination of PVCS and PPC 
      exhibited a trend toward better predictability for vascular stiffness (AUC 0.7738, P 
      = 0.001) than any of the two parameters alone. CONCLUSION: It is assumed that the 
      PVCS system is more predictable for vascular stiffness in our study. Moreover, the 
      combination of PVCS and PPC might be more useful as a screening test for vascular 
      stiffness.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes mellitus, 
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy are the most 
      commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true 
      visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To 
      date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. 
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: 
      Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy 
      subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice 
      multidetector computed tomography scanner. RESULTS: There were no differences in 
      age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between 
      healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT 
      measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with 
      nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant 
      relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48). 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS 
      in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy 
      subjects.

AB  - Peripheral artery occlusive disease and vascular calcification are highly prevalent 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients, however the association of the combination of 
      ankle-brachial index (ABI) and aortic arch calcification (AoAC) with clinical 
      outcomes in patients undergoing HD is unknown. In this study, we investigated 
      whether the combination of ABI and AoAC is independently associated with overall and 
      cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. The median follow-up period was 5.7 years. 
      Calcification of the aortic arch was assessed by chest X-ray. Forty-seven patients 
      died including 24 due to cardiovascular causes during the follow-up period. The 
      study patients were stratified into four groups according to an ABI < 0.95 or ≥0.95 
      and an AoAC score of >4 or ≤4 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. 
      Those with an ABI < 0.95 and AoAC > 4 (vs. ABI ≥ 0.95 and AoAC score ≤ 4) were 
      associated with overall (hazard ratio [HR], 4.913; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.932 to 12.497; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular (HR, 3.531; 95% CI, 1.070 to 11.652; 
      p = 0.038) mortality in multivariable analysis. The combination of a low ABI and 
      increased AoAC was associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in 
      patients undergoing HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), and it is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
      mortality. Deoxycholic acid, a metabolite of circulating bile acids, is elevated in 
      CKD and induces vascular mineralization and osteogenic differentiation in animal 
      models. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of clinical trial participants. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 112 patients with moderate to severe CKD (estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, 20-45mL/min/1.73m(2)) who participated in a randomized controlled 
      study to examine the effects of phosphate binders on vascular calcification. 
      PREDICTOR: Serum deoxycholic acid concentration. OUTCOMES: Baseline coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) volume score and bone mineral density (BMD) and change in CAC 
      volume score and BMD after 9 months. MEASUREMENTS: Deoxycholic acid was assayed in 
      stored baseline serum samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 
      CAC was measured using a GE-Imitron C150 scanner, and BMD was determined using 
      computed tomographic scans of the abdomen with calibrated phantom of known density. 
      RESULTS: Higher serum deoxycholic acid concentrations were significantly correlated 
      with greater baseline CAC volume and lower baseline BMD. After adjusting for 
      demographics, coexisting illness, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, and concentrations of circulating markers of mineral metabolism, including 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth 
      factor 23, a serum deoxycholic acid concentration > 58ng/mL (the median) was 
      positively associated with baseline CAC volume (β=0.71; 95% CI, 0.26-1.16; P=0.003) 
      and negatively associated with baseline BMD (β = -20.3; 95% CI, -1.5 to -39.1; 
      P=0.04). Serum deoxycholic acid concentration > 58ng/mL was not significantly 
      associated with change in CAC volume score after 9 months (β=0.06; 95% CI, -0.09 to 
      0.21; P=0.4). The analysis for the relationship between baseline deoxycholic acid 
      concentrations and change in BMD after 9 months was not statistically significant, 
      but was underpowered. LIMITATIONS: The use of nonfasting serum samples is a 
      limitation because deoxycholic acid concentrations may vary based on time of day and 
      dietary intake. Few trial participants with complete data to evaluate the change in 
      CAC volume score (n=75) and BMD (n=59). No data for changes in deoxycholic acid 
      concentrations over time. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with moderate to severe CKD, 
      higher serum deoxycholic acid concentrations were independently associated with 
      greater baseline CAC volume score and lower baseline BMD.

TI  - Relation of fibroblast growth factor-23 and cardiovascular calcification in 
      end-stage kidney disease patients on regular hemodialysis.
PG  - 51-60
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.198127 [doi]
AB  - More than half of deaths in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are due to 
      cardiovascular disease. Elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) was found to 
      be associated with mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients and correlates with 
      peripheral calcification. Aortic calcification is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification. Both aortic and peripheral vascular calcifications were associated 
      with mortality in chronic kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the relation 
      between intact FGF-23 and cardiovascular calcification in patients with ESKD who 
      were maintained on regular HD. Sixty clinically stable ESKD patients on regular HD 
      were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. They were evaluated by basal 
      abdominal X-ray. They were divided into two groups: (Group A, n = 30), patients with 
      abdominal aortic calcification who underwent multislice computerized tomography scan 
      to measure coronary artery calcification score; and (Group B, n = 30), patients 
      without abdominal aortic calcification. All of them were evaluated by lipid profile 
      and dialysis adequacy parameters. Fifty percent of patients had vascular 
      calcification. We found a significant positive correlation between age and intact 
      FGF-23; significant positive correlations between age, body mass index, duration of 
      HD, and abdominal aortic calcification score. FGF-23 of all patients was elevated 
      and had significant positive correlation with aortic and coronary calcifications in 
      addition to lipid profile, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and inflammatory 
      markers. Plasma intact FGF-23 was elevated in nondiabetic ESKD patients, and 
      vascular calcification was prevalent in such group of patients with many traditional 
      and nontraditional risk factors. Possibly through its disturbing effects on minerals 
      and parathyroid hormone, FGF-23 might indirectly affect vascular calcification. LVMI 
      was higher in patients with vascular calcification and correlated positively with 
      it.

      cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 668-77
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2013.28.6.668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and fetuin-A are vascular calcification 
      regulators that may be related to high cardiovascular (CV) mortality in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. We evaluated the relationship between OPG, fetuin-A, and pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV), a marker of vascular stiffness, and determined whether OPG and 
      fetuin-A were independent predictors of CV events in HD patients. METHODS: We 
      conducted a prospective observational study in 97 HD patients. OPG and fetuin-A were 
      measured at baseline and arterial stiffness was evaluated by PWV. All patients were 
      stratified into tertiles according to serum OPG levels. RESULTS: A significant trend 
      was observed across increasing serum OPG concentration tertiles for age, HD 
      duration, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and PWV. Multiple 
      linear regression analysis revealed that diabetes (β = 0.430, p = 0.000) and OPG 
      levels (β = 0.308, p = 0.003) were independently associated with PWV. The frequency 
      of new CV events was significantly higher in the upper OPG tertiles compared with 
      those in the lower OPG tertiles. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, upper 
      tertiles of OPG levels were significantly associated with CV events (hazard ratio = 
      4.536, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Serum OPG, but not fetuin-A, levels were closely 
      associated with increased vascular stiffness, and higher OPG levels may be 
      independent predictors of new CV events in HD patients.

TI  - A high abdominal aortic calcification score by dual X-ray absorptiometry is 
      associated with cardiovascular events after kidney transplantation.
PG  - 2253-2259
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic calcification is associated with an increased risk for 
      cardiovascular events in renal transplant recipients. This study focused on the 
      association of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and cardiovascular events 
      assessed using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scoring methodology for AAC. 
      METHODS: From 2008 to 2014, renal transplant recipients referred for a DXA procedure 
      within 6 months after transplantation were included in a retrospective, 
      single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cardiovascular 
      events, defined as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or transient 
      ischaemic attack, after transplantation. AAC was quantified using an 8-point scoring 
      system and patients were divided into three groups; a control group (AAC = 0), a low 
      AAC group (AAC = 1-3) and a high AAC group (AAC = 4-8). RESULTS: We evaluated 701 
      patients, 267 (38.1%) had detectable calcifications (low AAC 190 patients, high AAC 
      77 patients) and 434 (61.9%) had no calcifications. Cardiovascular events were seen 
      in 37 (8.5%) patients in the control group, in 18 (9.5%) in the low AAC group and in 
      20 (26.0%) in the high AAC group. Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of 
      the high AAC score showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
      2.44-7.33; P < 0.01] for cardiovascular events, while results were not significant 
      for the low AAC score. Multivariate analysis showed an independent significant 
      association between a high AAC score and cardiovascular events [HR 2.78 (95% CI 
      1.05-7.64); P = 0.04]. Assessment of the continuous net reclassification index 
      (NRI), comparing the combined clinical variables with a model of both AAC scoring 
      and clinical variables, showed an NRI of 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.86; P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: An independent association between a high AAC score, assessed by DXA, 
      and cardiovascular events was identified and provides an opportunity for early 
      cardiovascular risk stratification in renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Aberrant activation of Wnt pathways in arteries associates with vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to increased cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of vascular calcification in CKD patients 
      remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical association between 
      abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification in ESRD patients. 
      METHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples of 
      radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous fistula surgery. Expression of 
      Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association 
      between Wnt activities and vascular calcification rates. RESULTS: 
      Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that increased expressions of β-catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed in the subjects with vascular 
      calcification. Further correlation analysis identified that β-catenin expression in 
      overall arterial samples was significantly associated with the expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also found significant correlation between expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis demonstrated that Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular 
      calcification in patients with ESRD. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased 
      activation of Wnt pathways in the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is 
      significantly correlated with the incidence of vascular calcification. These 
      findings support Wnt pathways as a potential target for future therapy of vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast 
      activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent data indicate 
      that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet 
      receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was 
      assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to 
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin 
      levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
      determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. 
      Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) 
      (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of 
      AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin 
      levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher 
      body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower 
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In 
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history 
      (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
      determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that 
      patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
      multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
      experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
      protects against progression of vascular calcification.

TI  - Vascular calcification in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 777-80
AB  - Vascular calcifications represent a severe complication of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5. The 
      factors influencing the development of this complication are in close relation with 
      the pathology of chronic dialysis premorbid condition, and with therapy as well. The 
      present article highlights the association between several factors and the 
      development or the aggravation of vascular calcifications in continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The results are not always in accordance with 
      similar literature data, but there is a lack of researches regarding mineral 
      metabolism in peritoneal dialysis patients versus those on chronic hemodialysis.

TI  - Usefulness of pretransplant aortic arch calcification evaluation for kidney 
      transplant outcome prediction in one year follow-up.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455588 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events and 
      hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We aimed 
      to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict 
      post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its 
      association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in 
      one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 
      kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two 
      radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa 
      et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The mismatching results were 
      repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and 
      carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry 
      before and one year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and 
      cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1 year. We found out that eGFR(1year) 
      correlated with eGFR(discharge) and calcium based on hospital discharge data 
      (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFR(discharge) 
      (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR(1year) than AoAC combined with 
      recipient eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four 
      (10.81%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV 
      ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In 
      conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE 
      rate within 1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray 
      together with recipient eGFR(discharge) could be related to kidney function in 
      one-year follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend 
      lateral abdominal radiographs to assess vascular calcification in incident dialysis 
      patients. However, nearly all dialysis patients in the United States receive chest 
      radiographs at dialysis therapy inception, which may provide readily available 
      information on coronary artery (CAC) and aortic arch calcification (AAC). We 
      determined the prevalence of CAC and AAC visible on plain chest radiographs and 
      their associations with mortality in our dialysis population. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective analysis. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 93 participants who received 
      maintenance hemodialysis at the San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center in 
      2009-2010. PREDICTOR: Presence of CAC and AAC as evaluated by a radiologist. 
      OUTCOME: All-cause mortality. RESULTS: Average age was 64 years, 22% were African 
      American, and 97% were men. CAC and AAC prevalences were 25% and 58%, respectively. 
      During 20 months' follow-up, 28% died. CAC was associated with mortality in models 
      including cardiovascular (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.59) and dialysis-related (HR, 
      2.86; 95% CI, 1.24-6.60) risk factors. AAC was associated with HRs of 5.25 (95% CI, 
      1.46-17.72) in cardiovascular risk factor-adjusted models and 7.31 (95% CI, 
      2.03-26.34) in dialysis models. When CAC and AAC were both included in models, both 
      CAC (HR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.24-9.36) and AAC (HR, 6.23; 95% CI, 1.64-23.66) remained 
      significantly associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: The study sample is relatively 
      small and mostly male. CONCLUSIONS: CAC and AAC are highly prevalent on chest 
      radiographs in dialysis patients and strongly associated with mortality independent 
      of one another. Because these images are nearly ubiquitous, inexpensive, and often 
      obtained for other indications, they should be considered for risk assessment in 
      hemodialysis patients. Future studies are required to determine whether CAC or AAC 
      on chest radiography is additive or duplicative of the risk of aorto-iliac 
      calcification on lateral abdominal radiographs currently suggested by KDIGO.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein 
      (MDA-LDL) and MDA-LDL/LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) ratio are risk factors for 
      arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no information is 
      available on these parameters or their associations with coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-seven 
      HD patients and 26 control subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. 
      Serum MDA-LDL concentrations and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios were examined. HD patients had 
      significantly higher MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios than the controls (105.1 ± 27.5 vs. 81.4 ± 
      18.9 mU/mg, P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in serum 
      MDA-LDL levels between the 2 groups. CAC scores were examined only in HD patients 
      and their possible associations with the clinical/laboratory data were analysed. 
      Analysis of HD patients showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio has an association with 
      presence of CVD, CAC score, HD duration, MDA-LDL, or haemoglobin A1C. In addition, 
      the CAC score was positively correlated with serum MDA-LDL level (P = 0.048) and 
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (P = 0.006). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (β = 0.04, P = 0.003) and HD duration (β = 
      0.16, P = 0.007) were independently associated with CAC score. CONCLUSION: The 
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio of HD patients was significantly higher than that of non-HD 
      subjects and was independently associated with the CAC score. Therefore, this ratio 
      could be an important risk factor for CAC in HD patients.

TI  - Study of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders in newly detected advanced 
      renal failure patients: A Hospital-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - 874-885
AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected, untreated 
      predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a tertiary care 
      hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational study. A total of 95 
      (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent clinical evaluation, 
      biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
      albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25- hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any abnormality including 
      fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular calcification (CVC)]. 
      Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 33.6% of the study 
      patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 
      hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. CVC was seen in 
      22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly involving the mitral valve. Patients 
      with CVC were more likely to be males and smokers. There was no significant 
      difference in iPTH levels between patients with or without CVC. AAC was seen in 
      10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray. Patients with AAC had higher levels of 
      iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels of calcium compared to patients without 
      AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in 41.05% of our patients and was more 
      prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 
      25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that newly detected, naïve Indian CKD patients have 
      a high prevalence of disturbances of mineral metabolism including 
      hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, abnormal BMD, and valvular and vascular 
      calcification, even before initiating dialysis.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the distribution of coronary artery calcium 
      score (CACS) by age group and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and to evaluate the 
      association between CV risk factors and CACS classification in asymptomatic adults. 
      The study included 31,545 asymptomatic Koreans, over 20 years of age with no 
      previous history of malignancy, proven coronary artery disease, or stroke, who 
      underwent CACS computed tomography at the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical 
      Center, between January 2005 and June 2013. Mean (±SD) age was 53.8 (±8.5) years 
      overall, 56.1 (±8.3) in men, and 53.3 (±8.5) in women. They were classified into 
      five groups based on their resting CACS: none (CAC = 0), minimal (0 < CAC ≤ 10), 
      mild (10 < CAC ≤ 100), moderate (100 < CAC ≤ 400), and extensive (400 > CAC). Older 
      age groups exhibited higher CACS values. The proportion of CACS classification in 
      our study was 55.5 % with no CACS, 9.5 % with minimal CACS, 19.8 % with mild CACS, 
      10.8 % with moderate CACS, and 4.3 % with extensive CACS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 
      were calculated for CV risk factors to determine their association with CACS. When 
      analyzed according to sex, in males, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with the 
      presence of hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, chronic kidney 
      disease, and smoking status. While, in females, the adjusted OR for CACS increased 
      with the presence of HT, DM, and obesity. CV risk factors appear to be significantly 
      associated with CACS in the Korean population.

AB  - Arterial stiffness (Ast) individually predicts cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Ast 
      increases via vascular calcification and can be characterized by pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV). We assessed the influence of mineral and bone metabolism on Ast in dialyzed 
      (D) and renal transplanted (Tx) children by measuring fetuin-A and bone markers 
      [bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP); beta-CrossLaps (beta)]. Normalized 
      PWV/height (PWV/h) of 11 D and 17 Tx patients was measured by applanation tonometry. 
      Levels of calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), fetuin-A, and bone markers were analyzed. Ca 
      x P/fetuin-A ratio was calculated to characterize the balance of calcification and 
      inhibition. Cumulative dose of calcitriol was also assessed. Fetuin-A was lower in D 
      and Tx compared with healthy controls. Bone markers and Ca x P/ fetuin-A of D were 
      significantly higher than those of Tx and controls. In D PWV/h correlated with Ca x 
      P/fetuin-A and BALP (r=0.8; p=0.005, r=0.6, p=0.05, respectively); BALP correlated 
      with Ca x P/fetuin-A (r=0.7, p=0.01). In Tx, there was a correlation between 
      calcitriol administered before transplantation and PWV/h (r=0.5, p=0.04). Increased 
      bone turnover was coupled with an increased potential of calcium-phosphate 
      precipitation, as shown by the increased Ca x P/fetuin-A. It might explain the 
      connection between disturbed mineral and bone metabolism and Ast. Tx might be 
      beneficial on Ast, though follow-up studies are needed.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitor as an independent factor of progression of abdominal aortic 
      calcification in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be associated with vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing dialysis through hypomagnesemia. However, only 
      few studies have demonstrated the influence of PPIs on vascular calcification in 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). This study aimed to investigate whether 
      the use of PPIs accelerates vascular calcification in patients on HD. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 200 HD patients who underwent regular blood 
      tests and computed tomography (CT) between 2016 and 2017. The abdominal aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) was measured using abdominal CT. The difference in the ACI 
      values between 2016 and 2017 was evaluated as ΔACI. Patients were divided into PPI 
      and non-PPI groups, and variables, such as patient background, medication, 
      laboratory data, and ΔACI were compared. Factors independently associated with 
      higher ΔACI progression (≥ third tertile value of ΔACI in this study) were 
      determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The PPI and 
      non-PPI groups had 112 (56%) and 88 (44%) patients, respectively. Median and third 
      tertile value of ΔACIs were 4.2% and 5.8%, respectively. Serum magnesium was 
      significantly lower in the PPI (2.1 mg/dL) than in the non-PPI (2.3 mg/dL) group (P 
      <0.001). Median ΔACI was significantly higher in the PPI (5.0%) than in the non-PPI 
      (3.8%) group (P = 0.009). A total of 77 (39%) patients had a higher ΔACI. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed that PPIs (odds ratio = 2.23; 95% confidence interval 
      = 1.11-4.49), annual mean calcium phosphorus product, ACI in 2016, baseline serum 
      magnesium levels, and HD vintage were independent factors associated with higher 
      ΔACI progression after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: PPI use may accelerate 
      vascular calcification in patients on HD. Further studies are necessary to elucidate 
      their influence on vascular calcification.

TI  - Coronary calcification is associated with lower bone formation rate in CKD patients 
      not yet in dialysis treatment.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a strong prognostic marker of mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients and has been associated with bone metabolism disorders in this population. 
      In earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular calcification also has 
      been documented. This study evaluated the association between coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) and bone histomorphometric parameters in CKD predialysis 
      patients assessed by multislice coronary tomography and by undecalcified bone 
      biopsy. CAC was detected in 33 (66%) patients, and their median calcium score was 
      89.7 (0.4-2299.3 AU). The most frequent bone histologic alterations observed 
      included low trabecular bone volume, increased eroded and osteoclast surfaces, and 
      low bone-formation rate (BFR/BS). Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted 
      for age, sex, and diabetes, showed that BFR/BS was independently associated with the 
      presence of coronary calcification [p = .009; odd ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.036-0.619]. This study showed a high prevalence of CAC in 
      asymptomatic predialysis CKD patients. Also, there was an independent association of 
      low bone formation and CAC in this population. In conclusion, our results provide 
      evidence that low bone-formation rate constitutes another nontraditional risk factor 
      for cardiovascular disease in CKD patients.

TI  - Cigarette Smoking is Associated with Decreased Bone Gla-protein (BGP) Levels in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 603-609

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-protein (BGP or osteocalcin) is a 
      vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. 
      Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis. METHODS: We carried out a secondary 
      analysis of the Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) study to investigate the association 
      between cigarette smoking and BGP levels in patients with end stage renal disease. 
      Data were collected in 370 haemodialysis patients, 37% (136) smokers (or ex-smokers) 
      and 63% (234) nonsmokers. Vascular calcifications and vertebral fractures 
      (quantitative morphometry) were identified on spine radiographs. RESULTS: Smokers 
      had significantly lower BGP levels (152 vs. 204 µg/L, p=0.003). Smokers had lower 
      plasma phosphate levels (4.2 vs. 4.7 mg/dl, p<0.01). Lower BGP levels were 
      associated with aortic calcification (p<0.001), iliac calcification (p=0.042) and 
      vertebral fractures (p=0.023). In addition, the regression model showed that smoking 
      is associated with a significant reduction of total BGP levels by about 18% 
      (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical study in a haemodialysis 
      population, which identifies cigarette smoking as a potential factor that can lower 
      BGP levels, a protective agent in bone and vascular health.

AB  - We assessed the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older living 
      kidney donors and its effect on recipient eGFR and graft histology. A total of 292 
      consecutive living pairs with donor age ≥50 from 2003 to 2013 were identified (mean 
      age 56; range 50-78; F/M: 1.8). Donor AAC was determined by prenephrectomy 
      unenhanced CT. Recipient eGFR and spot urine protein: creatinine ratios (UPCRs) were 
      recorded. A total of 180 recipients had 6-month protocol biopsies. AAC was present 
      in 40.7% of donors, and they were older (58.6 versus 54.7 years old, P < 0.0001) and 
      more likely to be male (77.6% vs. 37.3%, P = 0.004). There was no significant 
      difference in eGFR or spot UPCR up to 36 months in recipients of allografts from 
      donors with versus without AAC. At 6-month biopsy, there was a higher percentage of 
      allografts with vascular fibrous intimal thickening and arteriolar hyaline 
      thickening from donors with versus without AAC (vascular fibrous intimal thickening: 
      38.8% vs. 7.1% and arteriolar hyaline thickening: 35.8% vs. 7.1%; P < 0.001 for 
      both). The presence of donor AAC predicts the presence of vascular disease [vascular 
      fibrous intimal thickening (OR: 7.2; CI:2.9-17.9) and arteriolar hyaline thickening 
      (OR:5.7; CI:2.3-14.1)] in allografts at 6 months. Donor AAC is predictive of renal 
      vascular disease and may help to improve the screening of potential donors and 
      inform post-transplant management.

AB  - PURPOSE: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel 
      candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. The 
      aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression and 
      its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December 
      2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous 
      fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were collected 
      and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical 
      staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were 
      measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries was 56.25%. Sclerostin 
      expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum sclerostin levels in 
      patients with positive sclerostin expression were much higher than in those with 
      negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including 
      potential confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, 
      serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline 
      phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      showed that only serum sclerostin levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin 
      expression (p = 0.025). The area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for 
      predicting positive vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity 
      and 85.7% specificity (p  = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin 
      expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Positive expression 
      of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was related to high serum sclerostin 
      levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local and systemic regulator involved in 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - The effect of magnesium supplementation on vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease-a randomised clinical trial (MAGiCAL-CKD): essential study design and 
      rationale.
PG  - e016795

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality, which is thought to be caused by increased 
      propensity towards vascular calcification (VC). Magnesium (Mg) inhibits 
      phosphate-induced VC in vitro and in animal models and serum Mg is inversely 
      associated with cardiovascular mortality in predialysis CKD and in end-stage renal 
      disease. This paper will describe the design and rationale of a randomised 
      double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial, which will investigate 
      whether oral Mg supplementation can prevent the progression of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in subjects with predialysis CKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will 
      randomise 250 subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 
      45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 12 months treatment with either slow-release Mg hydroxide 
      30 mmol/day or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point is change in 
      CAC score as measured by CT at baseline and after 12 months treatment. Secondary end 
      points include change in pulse wave velocity, bone mineral density, measures of 
      mineral metabolism and clinical end points related to cardiovascular and renal 
      events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the local 
      biomedical research ethics committees and data protection agencies and will be 
      performed in accordance with the latest revision of the Helsinki Declaration. The 
      trial will examine for the first time the effect of increasing the uptake of a 
      putative VC inhibitor (ie, Mg) on progression of CAC in subjects with predialysis 
      CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02542319, pre-results.

TI  - FGF23 is independently associated with vascular calcification but not bone mineral 
      density in patients at various CKD stages.
PG  - 2017-25
LID - 10.1007/s00198-011-1838-0 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: The hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is involved in mineral 
      homeostasis but may also have a role in vascular calcification and bone 
      mineralization. In a cohort of 142 patients with CKD stages 2-5D, plasma FGF23 was 
      independently associated with aortic calcification but not with pulse wave velocity 
      or bone mineral density. INTRODUCTION: FGF23 is involved in mineral homeostasis but 
      may also have a role in vascular calcification and bone mineralization. Previous 
      studies related to FGF23 and vascular and bone outcomes have been restricted to 
      dialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to establish whether or not 
      plasma FGF23 is associated with aortic and coronary calcification, arterial 
      stiffness, and bone mineral density in patients with early as well as late stages of 
      CKD. METHODS: In a cohort of 142 patients with CKD stages 2-5D, we made routine 
      biochemistry and intact FGF23 determinations, and assessed aortic and coronary 
      calcification, bone mineral density (BMD), and arterial stiffness by multislice 
      spiral computed tomography and automated pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: Plasma 
      intact FGF23 levels were elevated in CKD patients; the elevation preceded that of 
      serum phosphate in early-stage CKD. Patients with elevated FGF23 levels had higher 
      aortic and coronary calcification scores than patients with lower FGF23 levels. 
      Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that only age (p < 0.001) and 
      FGF23 (p = 0.008) were independently associated with aortic calcification score. 
      Plasma FGF23 was neither associated with PWV nor with BMD. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      suggest that plasma FGF23 is an independent biomarker of vascular calcification in 
      patients with various CKD stages including early stages. The association between 
      vascular calcification and FGF23 levels appears to be independent of BMD. It remains 
      to be seen whether this association is independent of bone turnover and bone mass.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification in patients with CKD.
PG  - 109-118
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0260-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is independently associated with 
      cardiovascular events in dialysis patients and in the general population. However, 
      data in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are limited. We analyzed 
      determinants and prognostic value of AAC in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: We 
      included patients with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy from the 
      MASTERPLAN study, a randomized controlled trial that started in 2004. In the period 
      2008-2009, an X-ray to evaluate AAC was performed in a subgroup of patients. We 
      studied AAC using a semi-quantitative scoring system by lateral lumbar X-ray. We 
      used baseline and 2-year data to find determinants of AAC. We used a composite 
      cardiovascular endpoint and propensity score matching to evaluate the prognostic 
      value of AAC. RESULTS: In 280 patients an X-ray was performed. In 79 patients (28 %) 
      the X-ray showed no calcification, in 62 patients (22 %) calcification was minor 
      (<4), while 139 patients (50 %) had moderate or heavy calcification (≥4). Older age, 
      prior cardiovascular disease, higher triglyceride levels, and higher phosphate 
      levels were independent determinants of a calcification score ≥4. AAC score ≥4 was 
      independently associated with cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio of 5.5 
      (95 % confidence interval 1.2-24.8). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of AAC can identify CKD 
      patients at higher cardiovascular risk, and may provide important information for 
      personalized treatment. Whether this approach will ultimately translate into better 
      outcomes remains to be answered.

      everolimus-eluting stent (EES, XIENCE V/PROMUS Stent) in routine clinical practice 
      at 47 centers. In this study, 1848 lesions (1546 patients) were assessed using 
      quantitative coronary angiography. In these 1546 patients, renal function data were 
      unknown in 26 patients. Three patients in 70 patients with dialysis and 56 patients 
      in 1450 patients with no dialysis were excluded, because they had multiple lesions 
      with mixed calcification lesions. We evaluated the effects of CCA on 8-month 
      angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes in dialysis and non-dialysis patients. 
      Moderate-to-severe (Ca group) and none-to-mild CCA (non-Ca group) were observed in 
      33 lesions (30 patients) and 48 lesions (37 patients) in dialysis patients, and 
      these were observed in 306 lesions (286 patients) and 1303 lesions (1108 patients) 
      in non-dialysis patients, respectively. In non-dialysis patients, the 
      ischemic-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR) and MACE rate over the 
      3 years were significantly higher in the Ca group than in the non-Ca group (5.8 vs. 
      3.1%, p = 0.025 and 10.0 vs. 5.0%, p = 0.0011). In dialysis patients, ID-TLR and 
      MACE rates were high in both groups (14.3 vs. 17.9%, p = 0.85 and 17.5 vs. 36.1%, 
      p = 0.16). In non-dialysis patients, 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical 
      outcomes were worse in the Ca group. However, in dialysis patients, both outcomes 
      were worse regardless of CCA.Clinical Trial registration

TI  - Impact of vascular calcifications on arteriovenous fistula survival in hemodialysis 
      patients: a five-year follow-up.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1159/000380823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis 
      patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The aim 
      of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications may have 
      on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival. METHODS: This study included 90 
      patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular calcification scores 
      ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access calcification score); patients 
      were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and 
      severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 
      5 years after calcification measurement or until the patient's 
      death/transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with more pronounced vascular 
      calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed a significant relationship between calcification score and male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and 
      intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal 
      differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification 
      scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 
      3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 
      (CI 0.97-22.38). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse 
      survival of native arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.

TI  - Intima media thickness in children undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 1557-64
LID - 10.1007/s00467-012-2173-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uremic vasculopathy, including vascular calcification, increases the 
      risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. We have investigated the prevalence and factors associated with 
      vasculopathy in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in 
      a single center. METHODS: Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and its 
      relation with demographics, biochemical parameters and medication was analyzed in 60 
      patients (mean age 12.9 ± 3.4 years; 27 girls) treated with PD (n = 31) or HD (n = 
      29) for 34 ± 34 months. Patients were divided into two groups: normal cIMT and 
      increased cIMT. RESULTS: Mean levels of calcium, phosphate and calcium/phosphate 
      product were in the normal range, the but parathyroid hormone level, 729 ± 670 
      pg/mL, was higher than the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality 
      Iniative (K/DOQI) recommendations. Twenty-nine patients had increased cIMT, which 
      was associated with time on dialysis of >2 years, hypercalcemia, higher daily dose 
      of calcitriol and HD (vs. PD). In the multivariate analysis, accounting for time on 
      dialysis, HD persisted as a risk for increased cIMT. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 
      increased cIMT in children on dialysis is similar to that reported in adults with 
      CKD and increased with time on dialysis. HD was associated with increased cIMT, 
      independently of time on dialysis; however, the results should be interpreted with 
      caution due to the possible impact of confounding factors. These results underline 
      the need to monitor and, if possible, prevent and treat increased cIMT in children 
      on dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of 
      studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant recipients, 
      and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft 
      prognosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal 
      transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We 
      established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before 
      transplantation. We analyzed the impact of calcification in graft and patient 
      survival, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal 
      function, and mineral metabolism. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) 
      before renal transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical 
      differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass 
      index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to 
      first 2 years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft 
      survival in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In 
      line with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and 
      cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P = 
      .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent predictor 
      for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time of 
      transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after renal 
      transplantation.

TI  - Histopathology of Veins Obtained at Hemodialysis Arteriovenous Fistula Creation 
      Surgery.
PG  - 3076-3088
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2016050598 [doi]
AB  - Stenosis from venous neointimal hyperplasia is common in native arteriovenous 
      fistulas (AVFs). However, the preexisting histologic characteristics of veins at 
      fistula creation, and associations thereof with baseline patient factors, have not 
      been well characterized. In this study, we conducted histologic analysis of a 
      segment of the vein used for anastomosis creation, obtained during AVF creation from 
      554 of the 602 participants in the multicenter Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation 
      Cohort Study. We quantified intimal and medial areas and lengths of the internal and 
      external elastic lamina by morphometry and assessed venous wall cells by 
      immunohistochemistry, extracellular matrix with Movat stain, and calcium deposition 
      by alizarin red stain. We also studied a representative subset of veins for markers 
      of monocyte/macrophage content, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and neoangiogenesis. 
      Neointima occupied >20% of the lumen in 57% of fully circumferential vein samples, 
      and neointimal hyperplasia associated positively with age and inversely with black 
      race. The neointima was usually irregularly thickened, sometimes concentric, and 
      contained α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells of smooth muscle or myofibroblast 
      origin. Proteoglycans admixed with lesser amounts of collagen constituted the 
      predominant matrix in the neointima. In 82% of vein samples, the media of vessel 
      walls contained large aggregates of collagen. A minority of veins expressed markers 
      of inflammation, cell proliferation, cell death, calcification, or neoangiogenesis. 
      In conclusion, we observed preexisting abnormalities, including neointimal 
      hyperplasia and prominent accumulation of extracellular matrix, in veins used for 
      AVF creation from a substantial proportion of this cohort.

TI  - Two years of maintenance hemodialysis has a pronounced effect on arterial stiffness 
      progression.
PG  - 193-199
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-0971-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The change of aortic stiffness, but not the particular baseline value, 
      plays a crucial role in estimating the patient risk with end-stage renal disease. 
      Therefore, we aimed to analyze the evolution of central and peripheral arterial 
      stiffness in hemodialysis population without previous cardiovascular events during a 
      2-year follow-up. METHODS: 60 hemodialysis patients (mean age 57.61 ± 13.01 years) 
      were prospectively interviewed, and they underwent blood tests, chest X-ray for 
      aortic calcification evaluation and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements at the 
      baseline, after 6 months and after 2 years of observation period. RESULTS: We found 
      significant progression of aortic PWV (12.73 vs. 14.24 m/s, p = 0.032) and 
      regression of brachial PWV (11.53 vs. 8.85 m/s, p < 0.001). CRP increase influenced 
      evolution of aortic PWV (β = 0.331, p = 0.031, R(2) = 0.599). Higher 
      β2-microglobulin values was related to the progression of aortic PWV (β = 0.219, 
      p = 0.022, R(2) = 0.568). Mean arterial blood pressure had influence only on the 
      short-term arterial stiffness evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis experience pronounced changes of arterial stiffness during the 2-year 
      follow-up period. The progression of aortic stiffness is related to inflammatory 
      response and particularly is influenced by β2-microglobulin concentration and aortic 
      calcification.

      hemodiafiltration.
PG  - c1-9
LID - 10.1159/000341598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphate is an important factor in explaining the high progress of 
      vascular calcification among dialysis patients. Today, phosphate concentration is 
      measured in plasma on a regular basis. The aim of this study was to find out if it 
      is possible to estimate total removed phosphate (TRp) in spent dialysate utilizing 
      UV absorbance during hemodiafiltration. METHODS: Eleven patients were monitored 
      online with UV absorbance at 297 nm, three times during one week each (n = 33). 
      Dialysate samples were taken at different times during treatment and from a 
      collection tank to chemically determine phosphate concentrations. Two mathematical 
      models (UVIND and UVGROUP) were tested to estimate TRp with supervision by UV 
      absorbance and compared with TRp measured in the tank (reference). RESULTS: High 
      correlation between UV absorbance and phosphate concentration for each single 
      patient and lower for the whole group together was found. TRp was (mean ± SD) 30.7 ± 
      7.3 mmol for the reference and 30.8 ± 8.2 and 29.1 ± 5.2 mmol for UVIND and UVGROUP, 
      respectively (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a novel possibility to 
      estimate TRp based on linear relationship between online monitoring of UV absorbance 
      and concentration of phosphate in spent dialysate.

TI  - Impact of vascular calcification on corrected QT interval at the time of renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1159/000334597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis 
      patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT 
      interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to 
      elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval 
      duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We performed a 
      single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. 
      Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. 
      Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays. RESULTS: In the final 
      analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT 
      interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an 
      independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of 
      aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular 
      history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged 
      QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is 
      associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

      with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - E35-40
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12335 [doi]
AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis 
      vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This study 
      examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in brachial 
      and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven 
      radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine predialysis 
      and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender matched controls 
      undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation (6 renal). Arterial 
      stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology, morphometric analysis of 
      intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load was performed using standard 
      techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients demonstrated significant arterial 
      intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio higher than controls (0.13 ± 0.12 vs. 
      0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium deposition was demonstrated on histology and the 
      calcium content in patients was higher than controls (34.68 ± 26.86 vs. 
      10.95 ± 9.18 μg/μg, p = 0.003). The blood vessel calcium content correlated with 
      arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p = 0.018). This study for the first time describes, 
      and suggests mechanistic linkage between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium 
      deposition, and increased functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis 
      patients. Our research could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the 
      uremic vasculature impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Predicts Less Coronary Artery Calcification and Diabetic Kidney 
      Disease Over 12 Years in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The CACTI Study.
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.2337/dc18-1527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between serum 
      uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal 
      protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during 
      2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes of 
      24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and after 
      a mean follow-up period of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion was defined 
      as ACR ≥30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year), and impaired GFR as 
      eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SUMOD was measured on stored baseline plasma samples 
      (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam computed tomography. 
      CAC progression was defined as a change in the square root-transformed CAC volume of 
      ≥2.5. RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level conferred lower odds of CAC progression 
      (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97), incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 
      0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56; 0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 0.24-0.83) 
      per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 ng/mL) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, 
      systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD 
      to models with traditional risk factors also significantly improved the prediction 
      performance for CAC progression and incident DKD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD 
      level predicted lower odds of both CAC progression and incident DKD over 12 years in 
      adults with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Relationships between abdominal aortic calcification, glomerular filtration rate, 
      and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic 
      kidney disease .
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.5414/CN109441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an established risk factor for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized 
      that AAC is associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as 
      with some other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled clinical 
      trial (RENEXC). A total of 151 patients (aged 66 ± 14 years) with an average 
      measured GFR (mGFR) of 22.5 ± 8.2 mL/min/1.73m2, not on renal replacement therapy, 
      irrespective of number of comorbidities, were included. GFR was measured with 
      iohexol clearance and estimated using cystatin C- and creatinine-based equations 
      (eGFR). AAC was evaluated with lateral lumbar X-ray using the scoring system 
      described by Kauppila. All patients underwent laboratory analyses, 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and standard echocardiography. Multiple linear 
      regression analyses controlling for sex, age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and 
      hypertension were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of AAC in this group of 
      patients was 73%, and 47% had severe calcification (AAC score ≥ 7). More men (76%) 
      had AAC than women (69%). AAC score was associated with mGFR (p = 0.03), eGFR (p = 
      0.006), plasma albumin (p = 0.006), plasma phosphate (p = 0.01), pulse pressure (p = 
      0.004), left ventricular mass (LVM) (p = 0.02), left atrial volume (LAV; p < 0.001), 
      and left atrial volume index (LAVI; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: AAC was highly prevalent 
      in CKD. The degree of calcification in the abdominal aorta was strongly associated 
      with a decline in GFR, a decrease in plasma albumin, an increase in plasma 
      phosphate, an increase in pulse pressure, and cardiac structural changes, such as an 
      increase in LVM, LAV, and LAVI. .

TI  - Ankle--brachial index, vascular calcifications and mortality in dialysis patients.
PG  - 318-25
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a noninvasive method to evaluate 
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). ABI <0.9 diagnoses PAD; ABI >1.3 is a false 
      negative caused by noncompressible arteries. The aim of this study is to evaluate 
      the association between ABI with vascular calcifications (VC) and with mortality, in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We studied 219 HD patients (60% male; 20% 
      diabetic). At baseline, ABI was evaluated by a Doppler device. VCs were evaluated by 
      two methods: the abdominal aorta calcification score (AACS) in a lateral plain X-ray 
      of the abdominal aorta and the simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) in plain 
      X-rays of the pelvis and hands. VC were also classified by their anatomical 
      localization in main vessels (aorta and iliac-femoral axis) and in peripheral or 
      distal vessels (pelvic, radial or digital). The cutoff values for the different VC 
      scores in relation with ABI were determined by receiver operating characteristic 
      curve analysis. Biochemical parameters were time averaged for the 6 months preceding 
      ABI evaluation. RESULTS: An ABI <0.9, an ABI >1.3 or a normal ABI were found, 
      respectively, in 90 (41%), in 42 (19%) and in 87 (40%) patients. AACS ≥6 and SVCS >3 
      were found, respectively, in 98 (45%) and 95 (43%) patients. The adjusted odds ratio 
      (OR) for having an ABI <0.9 was 2.5 (P = 0.007) for AACS ≥6 and 4.5 (P < 0.001) for 
      iliac-femoral calcification score (CS) ≥2. The adjusted OR for having an ABI >1.3 
      was 4.2 (P = 0.003) for pelvic CS and 3.7 (P = 0.006) for hand CS ≥2. During an 
      observational period of 28.9 months, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
      occurred, respectively, in 50 (23%) and in 29 (13%) patients. Adjusting for age, 
      diabetes, P levels, HD duration and cardiovascular disease at baseline, an ABI <0.9 
      [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.9, P < 0.001] and an ABI >1.3 (HR = 2.7, P = 0.038) were 
      associated with all-cause mortality; an ABI <0.9 (HR = 7.2, P = 0.002) and an ABI 
      >1.3 (HR = 5.1, P = 0.028) were associated with cardiovascular mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both low and high ABI were independent predictors of all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality. VC in main arteries were associated with an ABI <0.9. VC 
      in peripheral and distal arteries were associated with an ABI >1.3. ABI is a simple 
      and noninvasive method that allows the identification of high cardiovascular risk 
      patients.

TI  - Cholecalciferol in haemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, 
      proof-of-concept and safety study.
PG  - 1779-86
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of cholecalciferol supplementation in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) patients has been questioned. The objective of this randomized double-blinded 
      study is to assess whether cholecalciferol therapy can increase serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in haemodialysed patients and the safety 
      implications of this therapy on certain biological parameters and vascular 
      calcifications score. METHODS: Forty-three haemodialysis patients were randomized to 
      receive placebo or cholecalciferol (25,000 IU) therapy every 2 weeks. The biological 
      parameters, serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D and parathormone (PTH) levels, were 
      monitored monthly for 12 consecutive months. Vascular calcifications were assessed 
      by lateral X-ray radiography. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean serum 25(OH)D levels 
      were low and similar in both groups. Thirty patients (16 treated and 14 placebo) 
      completed the study: 11 patients died (5 placebo and 6 treated), 1 patient dropped 
      out and 1 patient was transplanted (both from the placebo group). After 1 year, the 
      percentage of 25(OH)D deficient patients was significantly lower in the treated 
      group. None of the patients developed hypercalcaemia. The PTH levels tended to 
      increase over the study period under placebo and to decrease in the cholecalciferol 
      group. The median changes in PTH levels from baseline to 1 year were statistically 
      different between the two groups [+80 (-58 to 153) and -115 (-192 to 81) under 
      placebo and cholecalciferol treatment, respectively, P=0.02].The calcification 
      scores increased equivalently in both groups (+2.3 per year). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cholecalciferol is effective and safe, and does not negatively affect calcium, 
      phosphorus, PTH levels and vascular calcifications. Additional studies are needed to 
      compare the impacts of nutritional and active vitamin D agents on vascular 
      calcification and mortality.

TI  - Targeting proinflammatory cytokines ameliorates calcifying phenotype conversion of 
      vascular progenitors under uremic conditions in vitro.
PG  - 12087
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-30626-z [doi]
LID - 12087
AB  - Severe vascular calcification develops almost invariably in chronic kidney patients 
      posing a substantial risk to quality of life and survival. This unmet medical need 
      demands identification of novel therapeutic modalities. We aimed to pinpoint 
      components of the uremic microenvironment triggering differentiation of vascular 
      progenitors to calcifying osteoblast-like cells. In an unbiased approach, assessing 
      the individual potency of 63 uremic retention solutes to enhance calcific phenotype 
      conversion of vascular progenitor cells, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and 
      TNF-α were identified as the strongest inducers followed by FGF-2, and PTH. 
      Pharmacologic targeting of these molecules alone or in combination additively 
      antagonized pro-calcifying properties of sera from uremic patients. Our findings 
      stress the importance of pro-inflammatory cytokines above other characteristic 
      components of the uremic microenvironment as key mediators of calcifying 
      osteoblastic differentiation in vascular progenitors. Belonging to the group of 
      "middle-sized molecules", they are neither effectively removed by conventional 
      dialysis nor influenced by established supportive therapies. Specific pharmacologic 
      interventions or novel extracorporeal approaches may help preserve regenerative 
      capacity and control vascular calcification due to uremic environment.

TI  - Growth Arrest-specific 6 Protein and Matrix Gla Protein in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 249-55
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Plasma protein growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) and matrix Gla protein 
      (MGP) are crucial mediators of vascular calcification and are involved in the 
      development of vascular complications in chronic kidney diseases. This study was set 
      out to investigate the relationship between plasma GAS6 levels and MGP in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Forty-six hemodialysis and 46 healthy individuals with normal kidneys were 
      recruited. Plasma GAS6 and MGP concentrations and related biochemical factors were 
      quantified as well as collection of data on clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Plasma GAS6 levels were significantly higher in the hemodialysis patients as 
      compared with the control group (763.52 ± 187.91 pg/mL versus 421.63 ± 189.91 pg/mL, 
      P < .001). Plasma MGP concentration was significantly lower in the hemodialysis 
      patients than the control group (52.35 ± 12.35 ng/mL versus 6.60 ± 19.54 ng/mL, P < 
      .001). The levels of GAS6 were inversely associated with MGP (r = -0.341, P = .02) 
      in the hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Increased GAS6 and decreased MGP levels 
      in hemodialysis patients, as mediators of induction or prevention of vascular 
      calcification, and their inverse correlation may suggest that there might be a role 
      in increased calcification process in hemodialysis patients or only as a secondary 
      phenomenon of advanced kidney failure. Their direct role on vascular calcification 
      needs further studies in the future.

TI  - Potential Correlation Between Circulating Fetuin-A and Pentraxin-3 With Biochemical 
      Parameters of Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 752-755
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular 
      risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been 
      well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 
      3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the 
      correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective 
      upon vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: We included 84 HD patients and 
      84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this 
      study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of 
      creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods. RESULTS: We found that the 
      serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P 
      in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum 
      levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, 
      fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as 
      duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 
      and PTH was significant only in the patient group. CONCLUSION: In this study, 
      increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. 
      According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable 
      markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

TI  - Associations of triiodothyronine levels with carotid atherosclerosis and arterial 
      stiffness in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2240-6
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02540311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: End-stage renal disease is linked to alterations in 
      thyroid hormone levels and/or metabolism, resulting in a high prevalence of 
      subclinical hypothyroidism and low triiodothyronine (T3) levels. These alterations 
      are involved in endothelial damage, cardiac abnormalities, and inflammation, but the 
      exact mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship 
      between serum free-T3 (fT3) and carotid artery atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, 
      and vascular calcification in prevalent patients on conventional hemodialysis. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: 137 patients were included. 
      Thyroid-hormone levels were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay, carotid 
      artery-intima media thickness (CA-IMT) by Doppler ultrasonography, carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (c-f PWV), and augmentation index by Sphygmocor device, and 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores by multi-slice computerized tomography. 
      RESULTS: Mean fT3 level was 3.70 ± 1.23 pmol/L. Across decreasing fT3 tertiles, c-f 
      PWV and CA-IMT values were incrementally higher, whereas CACs were not different. In 
      adjusted ordinal logistic regression analysis, fT3 level (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.97), age, and interdialytic weight gain were 
      significantly associated with CA-IMT. fT3 level was associated with c-f PWV in 
      nondiabetics but not in diabetics. In nondiabetics (n = 113), c-f PWV was positively 
      associated with age and systolic BP but negatively with fT3 levels (odds ratio = 
      0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: fT3 levels are inversely 
      associated with carotid atherosclerosis but not with CAC in hemodialysis patients. 
      Also, fT3 levels are inversely associated with surrogates of arterial stiffness in 
      nondiabetics.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification Score as A Predictor of All-Cause Mortality and 
      Cardiovascular Outcome in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 163-70
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2014.00124 [doi]
AB  - ♦ BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine whether the coronary artery calcification 
      score (CaCS) was associated with the prognosis of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. 
      ♦ METHODS: Adult PD patients who were clinically stable for at least 2 months were 
      recruited for this prospective, observational cohort study. Coronary artery 
      calcification was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography and was 
      recorded according to the Agatston score. The endpoints including all-cause 
      mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality were assessed. 
      Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause 
      mortality, cardiovascular events (CVEs), and cardiovascular mortality. ♦ RESULTS: A 
      total of 179 PD patients (86 men) with a mean age of 63.5 ± 14.8 years were 
      recruited for this study. Coronary artery calcification scores ranging from 0 to 
      5,257 were stratified as follows: no (CaCS = 0, n = 54), low (0 < CaCS < 400, n = 
      72), and high (CaCS ≥ 400, n = 53) calcification. The follow-up duration was 30.6 ± 
      16.2 (24-63) months. Compared with the no calcification group, patients with a 
      higher CaCS were older and had lower diastolic blood pressure, residual renal 
      function, and serum albumin, and higher HbA1C and serum insulin. Multivariate Cox 
      regression revealed that the CaCS was an independent predictor for all the 3 
      endpoints after adjustment in PD patients. ♦ CONCLUSIONS: CaCS was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.

TI  - Comparison of single CT scan assessment of bone mineral density, vascular

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite limitations of routine methods, Clinical Practice Guidelines 
      support the assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification in 
      renal transplant recipients. Changes in fat mass also occur post-transplantation, 
      although they are traditionally difficult to measure accurately. We report the 
      feasibility, convenience and accuracy of measuring the above 3 parameters using a 
      novel CT protocol. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 64 first renal 
      allograft recipients (eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Quantitative CT (QCT) BMD 
      analysis was conducted using CT lumbar spine (GE Medical Systems Lightspeed VCT & 
      Mindways QCT Pro Bone Mineral Densitometry System Version 4.2.3) to calculate spinal 
      volumetric BMD and compared with standard DXA calculated areal BMD at the spine, hip 
      and distal forearm. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by semi-quantitative 
      Aortic Calcification Index (ACI) method and compared with lateral lumbar x-ray 
      Kappuila score and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Visceral and subcutaneous adipose 
      tissue volume (Osirix 16 Ver 3.7.1) was compared with BMI. RESULTS: Participants 
      were 61 % male, had a mean age of 47 years, median ESKD duration of 5.4 years and a 
      mean eGFR of 54 ml/min. iDXA median T-score at proximal femur was -1.2 and at lumbar 
      spine was -0.2. Median QCT Trabecular T-score at lumbar spine was -1.2. The percent 
      of subjects with a T-score of < 2.5 by site and method was DXA Proximal Femur: 7 %, 
      DXA distal radius: 17 %, DXA spine: 9 %, QCT (American College of Radiology 
      cutoffs): 9 %. CT derived ACI correlated with PWV (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), pulse wave 
      pressure (r = 0.51, p < 0.001), QCT Trabecular (-0.31, p = 0.01) and cortical 
      volumetric BMD and history of cardiovascular events (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.02). Both 
      visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue correlated with BMI (r = 0.63 & 0.64, p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Single CT scan triple assessment of BMD, vascular calcification 
      and body composition is an efficient, accurate and convenient method of risk factor 
      monitoring post renal transplantation.

TI  - Mortality in kidney disease patients treated with phosphate binders: a randomized 
      study.
PG  - 487-93
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03820411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dietary phosphorous overload and excessive calcium intake 
      from calcium-containing phosphate binders promote coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) that may contribute to high mortality of dialysis patients. CAC has been found 
      in patients in early stages of nondialysis-dependent CKD. In this population, no 
      study has evaluated the potential role of phosphorus binders on mortality. This 
      study aimed to evaluate all-cause mortality as the primary end point in 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD patients randomized to different phosphate binders; 
      secondary end points were dialysis inception and the composite end point of 
      all-cause mortality and dialysis inception. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: This is a randomized, multicenter, nonblinded pilot study. Consecutive 
      outpatients (n=212; stage 3-4 CKD) were randomized to either sevelamer (n=107) or 
      calcium carbonate (n=105). Phosphorus concentration was maintained between 2.7 and 
      4.6 mg/dl for patients with stage 3-4 CKD and between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl for patients 
      with stage 5 CKD. The CAC score was assessed by computed tomography at study entry 
      and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. All-cause mortality, dialysis inception, and the 
      composite end point were recorded for up to 36 months. RESULTS: In patients 
      randomized to sevelamer, all-cause mortality and the composite end point were lower; 
      a nonsignificant trend was noted for dialysis inception. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer 
      provided benefits in all-cause mortality and in the composite end point of death or 
      dialysis inception but not advantages in dialysis inception. Larger studies are 
      needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Serum sclerostin: the missing link in the bone-vessel cross-talk in hemodialysis 
      patients?
PG  - 2165-74
LID - 10.1007/s00198-015-3127-9 [doi]
AB  - We found for the first time that in maintenance hemodialysis patients, higher 
      sclerostin serum level was associated with severe abdominal aortic calcification 
      (AAC). In addition, cortical bone microarchitecture (density and thickness) assessed 
      by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at tibia 
      was also independently associated with severe AAC. These results suggest that 
      sclerostin may be involved in the association of mineral and bone disorder with 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. INTRODUCTION: Severe abdominal 
      aortic calcifications are predictive of high cardiovascular mortality in maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients. In patients with end-stage renal disease, a high aortic 
      calcification score was associated with lower bone turnover on bone biopsies. Thus, 
      we hypothesized that sclerostin, a Wnt pathway inhibitor mainly secreted by 
      osteocytes and acting on osteoblasts to reduce bone formation, may be associated 
      with vascular calcifications in MHD patients. METHODS: Fifty-three MHD patients, 
      aged 53 years [35-63] (median [Q1-Q3]) were included. Serum was sampled before the 
      MHD session to assay sclerostin. Framingham score was computed and the abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) score was assessed according to Kauppila method on 
      lateral spine imaging using DEXA. Tibia bone status was evaluated by high-resolution 
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Patients were distributed 
      into two groups according to their AAC score: patients with mild or without AAC 
      (score below 6) versus patients with severe AAC (score of 6 and above). RESULTS: In 
      multivariate analysis, after adjustment on age, dialysis duration and diabetes, 
      serum sclerostin and cortical thickness were independently associated with severe 
      AAC (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43 for each 0.1 ng/mL increase [95 % confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.10-1.83]; p = 0.006 and 0.16 for 1 SD increase [0.03-0.73]; p = 0.018, 
      respectively). A second cardiovascular model adjusted on Framingham score and the 
      above mentioned confounders showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated sclerostin 
      serum level and poorer tibia cortical bone structure by HR-pQCT were positively and 
      independently associated with higher odds of severe AAC in MHD patients. Serum 
      sclerostin may become a biomarker of mineral and bone disorder and vascular risk in 
      MHD patients.

TI  - Daily intake and serum concentration of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) in haemodialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.

LID - S0009-9120(15)00391-4 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Decreased concentration of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) seems to be an important 
      risk factor of vascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimal 
      dietary intake, as well as serum MK-4 reference range, in HD has not been 
      determined, yet. The aim of the present study was to assess daily vitamin K1 and 
      MK-4 intakes and their relation to serum MK-4 concentration in HD patients. DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: Daily vitamin K1 and MK-4, micro- and macronutrients and energy intakes 
      were assessed using 3-day food diary completed by patients and serum MK-4 
      concentration was measured by HPLC [limit of quantification (LOQ): 0.055 ng/mL] in 
      85 HD patients (51 males) and 22 apparently healthy subjects. RESULTS: Daily MK-4 
      intake was significantly lower (by 29%) among HD, while K1 consumption was similar 
      in both groups. Daily MK-4 intake was associated with fat and protein consumption in 
      HD (r=0.43, p<0.001 and r=0.33, p=0.004, respectively). In HD serum MK-4 
      concentration was more frequently below LOQ (in 41% HD and 5% controls, p<0.001) and 
      in those HD with quantifiable values was lower than in the controls (by 42%). The 
      correlations between MK-4 concentrations and both MK-4 and K1 daily intakes were 
      weaker in HD (r=0.38 and r=0.30 respectively) than in the control group (r=0.47 and 
      r=0.45, respectively). In multiple regression analysis the variability of serum MK-4 
      concentrations in HD patients was explained by its daily intake. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Decreased serum MK-4 concentration in HD patients is caused by lower dietary MK-4 
      intake, mainly due to diminished meat consumption, and in addition, probably reduced 
      K1 conversion.

TI  - Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor is Associated with Coronary Artery 
      Calcification and Cardiovascular Disease in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis.
PG  - 664-672
LID - 10.1159/000489623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of morbidity and 
      mortality in hemodialysis patients. Vascular calcification is thought to play an 
      important role in causing CVD. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor 
      (suPAR) is a biomarker strongly predictive of cardiovascular outcomes in the 
      pathogenesis of diabetic patients with renal disease treated with hemodialysis. We 
      investigated the relationship between suPAR and coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: A total of 99 adult 
      hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this study. Plasma samples were analyzed for 
      suPAR with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the CAC score was determined 
      with multidetector computed tomography. The occurrence of cardiovascular events and 
      all-cause mortality during follow-up were recorded from January 1, 2010 to June 1, 
      2016. RESULTS: In 99 patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis, 91 (91.9%) had 
      varying degrees of CAC, and suPAR correlated positively with the CAC score in a 
      Spearman analysis. In a mean follow-up period of 33 months, 36 patients (36.4%) 
      experienced at least one cardiovascular event. When the quartiles of suPAR 
      concentrations were used as the cutoff points for a subgroup analysis, the incidence 
      of CVD and all-cause mortality was much higher in the higher quartiles of suPAR. In 
      a univariate Cox regression analysis, high suPAR was a risk factor for CVD and 
      all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: suPAR is associated with the CAC score and is a 
      risk factor for new-onset CVD in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

TI  - The relationship between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and vascular calcification

PG  - 47-53

AB  - Chronic inflammation was found to be correlated with coronary (CAC) and thoracic 
      peri-aortic calcification (TAC) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. 
      Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was introduced as a potential marker to 
      determine inflammation in cardiac and noncardiac disorders. Data regarding NLR and 
      its association with TAC and CAC are lacking. We aimed to determine the relationship 
      between NLR and vascular calcification in ESRD patients. This was a cross-sectional 
      study involving 56 ESRD patients (22 females, 34 males; mean age, 49.9 ± 14.2 years) 
      receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for ≥6 months in the Dialysis Unit of 
      Necmettin Erbakan University. TAC and CAC scores were measured by using an 
      electrocardiogram-gated 64-multidetector computed tomography. NLR was calculated as 
      the ratio of the neutrophils and lymphocytes. There was a statistically significant 
      correlation between NLR, TACS and CACS in ESRD patients (r = 0.43, P = 0.001 and 
      r = 0.30, P = 0.02, respectively). The stepwise linear regression analysis revealed 
      that age, as well as NLR were independent predictors of TACS. However, increased age 
      was the only independent predictor of CACS according to linear regression analysis. 
      Simple calculation of NLR can predict vascular calcification in ESRD patients.

TI  - Scavenging Intracellular ROS Attenuates p-Cresyl Sulfate-Triggered Osteogenesis 
      through MAPK Signaling Pathway and NF-κB Activation in Human Arterial Smooth Muscle 
      Cells.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12080472 [doi]
LID - 472
AB  - Osteogenesis in human arterial smooth muscle cell (HASMC) is a key feature of uremic 
      vascular calcification (UVC). Concerning pro-oxidant properties of p-cresyl sulfate 
      (PCS), the therapeutic effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger on PCS 
      triggered inflammatory signaling transduction in osteogenesis was investigated in 
      this translational research. Based on severity level of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), arterial specimens with immunohistochemistry stain were quantitatively 
      analyzed for UVC, oxidative injury and osteogenesis along with PCS concentrations. 
      To mimic human UVC, HASMC model was used to explore whether PCS-induced ROS could 
      trigger mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways with nuclear factor-κB 
      (NF-κB) translocation that drive context-specific gene/protein expression, including 
      Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In 
      parallel with PCS accumulation, CKD arteries corresponded with UVC severity, 
      oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), Runx2 and ALP. PCS directly 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
      (JNK)/P38 (pERK/pJNK/pP38) and modulated NF-κB translocation to promote expressions 
      of Runx2 and ALP in HASMC. Notably, intracellular ROS scavenger attenuated pERK 
      signaling cascade and downstream osteogenic differentiation. Collectively, our data 
      demonstrate PCS induces osteogenesis through triggering intracellular ROS, 
      pERK/pJNK/pP38 MAPK pathways and NF-κB translocation to drive Runx2 and ALP 
      expressions, culminating in UVC. Beyond mineral dysregulation, osteocytic conversion 
      in HASMC could be the stimulation of PCS. Thus PCS may act as a pro-osteogenic and 
      pro-calcific toxin. From the perspective of translational medicine, PCS and 
      intracellular ROS could serve as potential therapeutic targets for UVC in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Effects of lanthanum carbonate on vascular calcification in elderly maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 508-513

AB  - The effect of lanthanum carbonate on abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in the 
      elderly maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients was investigated. Fifty-four cases 
      subjected to routine MHD complicated with skin pruritus admitted to our hospital 
      were selected and randomly divided into case group (n=28) and control group (n=26). 
      The control group was given routine MHD alone. The case group was given lanthanum 
      carbonate additionally on the basis of routine MHD. The changes of itching degrees 
      at first and third month, and serum calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus 
      products, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels and AAC scores at third month 
      after treatments were compared between the two groups. The correlation between 
      calcium-phosphorus products and AAC scores was also analyzed. There was no 
      significant difference in the baseline of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum 
      creatinine (Scr), uric acid, albumin, hemoglobin, C reactive protein (CRP), low 
      density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, total 
      cholesterol between case group and control group (P>0.05 for all). There was also no 
      significant difference in the baseline itching scores between the case group and the 
      control group (P>0.05). At 1st and 3rd month after treatment, the itching scores in 
      the case group were 14.2 ± 3.2 and 10.5 ± 2.3, respectively, which were 
      significantly lower than the baseline and those in the control group (P<0.05 for 
      all). At 1st and 3rd month after treatment, the itching scores in the control group 
      were 23.6 ± 5.9 and 24.8 ± 6.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than 
      the baseline (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the baseline of serum 
      calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus products, iPTH levels between the case group 
      and control group (P>0.05). At 3rd month after treatment, serum phosphorus, 
      calcium-phosphorus products and iPTH levels in the case group were decreased 
      significantly as compared with the baseline (P<0.05), and the serum calcium, 
      phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus products, and iPTH levels were statistically 
      decreased as compared with those in the control group (P<0.05). The AAC scores 
      showed statistically significant difference between the case group and the control 
      group (P<0.05). The serum phosphorus and AAC scores showed a positive correlation in 
      both two groups. It was suggested that the administration of lanthanum carbonate in 
      the elderly MHD patients can effectively relieve itching, and simultaneously reduce 
      serum phosphorus and iPTH levels, resulting in the attenuation of vascular 
      calcification.

TI  - Does hemodiafiltration reduce vascular stiffness measured by aortic pulse wave 
      velocity compared with high-flux hemodialysis?
PG  - 391-5
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12119 [doi]
AB  - Hemodialfiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce the frequency of intradialytic 
      hypotension compared with hemodialysis (HD). We wished to determine whether HDF 
      resulted in improvement of arterial stiffness compared with HD. We reviewed 
      peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements in a cross-sectional 
      analysis of stable HDF and HD outpatients. One hundred forty-one HDF patients were 
      matched to 148 HD patients in terms of age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, peripheral 
      blood pressure, and body mass. Pulse wave velocity was not different between the HD 
      and HDF cohorts (median 9.1 [8.0-10.7] m/s vs. 9.7 [8.5-11.6] m/s). Similarly, there 
      were no differences in central aortic pressure (149.2 ± 30.9 mmHg vs. 151.9 ± 35.2 
      mmHg), or aortic (39 [25.1-51.2]% vs. 38.6 [25.8-51.4]%) and brachial (3.8 [-24.3 to 
      26.9]% vs. 3 [-22.4 to 27.1]%) augmentation indices, respectively. Pulse wave 
      velocity did not differ between adult patients treated by HD and HDF, and similarly, 
      there were no differences in central aortic pressure, aortic or brachial 
      augmentation indices, and cardiac diastolic perfusion. Our study suggests that HDF 
      does not appear to offer any benefit over HD in terms of vascular stiffness.

TI  - Association Between Risk Factors Including Bone-Derived Biomarkers and Aortic Arch 
      Calcification in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 1554-1562
LID - 10.1159/000494441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed 
      the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray 
      examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
      biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients 
      with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited 
      lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
      associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
      AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
      dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
      circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were independently associated with AoAC.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency, cardiovascular disease and abnormal bone mineral metabolism 
      are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Abnormal bone mineral metabolism has 
      been linked to vascular calcification in CKD. Sclerostin has emerged as an important 
      messenger in cross talk between bone-vascular axis. We analyzed sclerostin in 
      subjects who participated in the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial 
      investigating the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on vascular function in 
      non-diabetic CKD stage G3-4 and vitamin D ≤ 20 ng/ml [CTRI/2013/05/003648]. Patients 
      were randomized (1:1) to receive either two directly observed oral doses of 300,000 
      IU of cholecalciferol or matching placebo at baseline and 8 weeks. Of the 120 
      subjects enrolled, 58 in the cholecalciferol group and 59 in the placebo group 
      completed the study. At baseline, serum levels of sclerostin were similar in both 
      groups (cholecalciferol - median;190pg/ml, IQR;140-260 pg/ml and placebo - 
      median;180 pg/ml, IQR; 140-240 pg/ml, p = 0.67). 16 weeks after cholecalciferol 
      supplementation, there was no change in level of sclerostin (mean change;1.10 pg/ml, 
      95%CI; -27.34 to 29.34 pg/ml, p = 0.25). However, a significant decrease in 
      sclerostin level was noted in the placebo group (mean change; -31.94 pg/ml, 95%CI; 
      -54.76 to -9.13 pg/ml, p = 0.002). Change (Δ) in sclerostin level at 16 weeks 
      correlated negatively with Δ eGFR (r = -0.20, p = 0.03) and positively with Δuric 
      acid (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) but not with Δ25(OH) D (r = 0.06, p = 0.54), Δ iPTH 
      (r = - 0.03, p = 0.78) ΔFGF23 (r = - 0.08, p = 0.38) and Δ125 (OH)(2) D (r = - 0.04, 
      p = 0.65). In conclusion, high dose cholecalciferol supplementation did not change 
      sclerostin levels in non-diabetic stage 3-4 CKD subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common among patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and predicts the risk for cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD). We examined the associations of novel risk factors with CAC progression among 
      patients with CKD. METHODS: Among 1123 CKD patients in the Chronic Renal 
      Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, CAC was measured in Agatston units at baseline 
      and a follow-up visit using electron beam computed tomography or multidetector 
      computed tomography. RESULTS: Over an average 3.3-year follow-up, 109 (25.1%) 
      participants without CAC at baseline had incident CAC and 124 (18.0%) participants 
      with CAC at baseline had CAC progression, defined as an annual increase of ≥100 
      Agatston units. After adjustment for established atherosclerotic risk factors, 
      several novel risk factors were associated with changes in CAC over follow-up. 
      Changes in square root transformed CAC score associated with 1 SD greater level of 
      risk factors were -0.20 (95% confidence interval, -0.31 to -0.10; p < 0.001) for 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, 0.14 (0.02-0.25; p = 0.02) for 24-h urine 
      albumin, 0.25 (0.15-0.34; p < 0.001) for cystatin C, -0.17 (-0.27 to -0.07; p < 
      0.001) for serum calcium, 0.14 (0.03-0.24; p = 0.009) for serum phosphate, 0.24 
      (0.14-0.33; p < 0.001) for fibroblast growth factor-23, 0.13 (0.04-0.23; p = 0.007) 
      for total parathyroid hormone, 0.17 (0.07-0.27; p < 0.001) for interleukin-6, and 
      0.12 (0.02-0.22; p = 0.02) for tumor necrosis factor-α. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced kidney 
      function, calcium and phosphate metabolism disorders, and inflammation, independent 
      of established CVD risk factors, may progress CAC among CKD patients.

      implantation following rotational atherectomy for severely calcified de novo 
      coronary lesions: Results of a 22-center study (Tokyo-MD PCI Study).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term clinical outcomes of permanent polymer everolimus-eluting 
      stent (PP-EES) implantation after rotational atherectomy (RA) have not been fully 
      evaluated. We sought to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of PP-EES 
      implantation after RA and assess the impact of hemodialysis on this treatment 
      strategy. METHODS: Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
      with PP-EES at 22 institutions between January 2010 and December 2011 were enrolled 
      in this multicenter, observational trial. From a total of 1918 registered patients, 
      113 patients with 115 de-novo lesions who underwent PCI with PP-EES following RA 
      were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac 
      event (MACE) defined as the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction (MI), and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). 
      RESULTS: Long-term follow-up was available for 112 patients (99.1%). The median 
      follow-up period was 2.9 (interquartile range 1.9-3.6) years. The mean age of the 
      patients was 72.3 ± 8.8 years and 64 patients (56.6%) had chronic kidney disease 
      (≥stage 3, 42 on hemodialysis). The cumulative incidences of MACE, non-fatal MI, and 
      TLR were 22.1%, 5.3%, and 10.6%, respectively. Cox's proportional hazards analysis 
      showed that the independent predictors of TLR were hemodialysis and chronic total 
      occlusion. (HR, 14.1; 95% CI, 1.74-155.5; p = 0.01, HR, 9.01; 95% CI, 1.34-62.5; 
      p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: PP-EES implantation after lesion modification by RA is 
      considered to be a feasible treatment strategy for heavily calcified lesions. 
      Hemodialysis and chronic total occlusion appeared to be associated with TLR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of warfarin on the risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease is 
      unknown among chronic hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation (HD-AF). 
      METHODS: Population-based propensity score and prescription time-distribution 
      matched cohort study including 6719 HD-AF patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥ 2 
      were divided into warfarin users and nonusers and followed-up for CV events and 
      death. RESULTS: Warfarin treatment in HD-AF patients with AF preceding HD was 
      associated with higher risks of developing congestive heart failure [hazard ratio 
      (HR)=1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.29-2.58, p<0.01], peripheral artery 
      occlusive disease (HR=3.42, 95% CI=1.86-6.31, p<0.01), and aortic valve stenosis 
      (HR=3.20, 95% CI=1.02-9.98, p<0.05). Warfarin users were not associated with risks 
      of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and all-cause mortality as compared to nonusers. 
      CONCLUSION: Warfarin may be associated with vascular calcification, increasing the 
      risks of congestive heart failure and peripheral artery occlusive disease among 
      HD-AF patients.

TI  - Nonculprit coronary plaque characteristics of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 448-56
LID - 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.112.000165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) promotes the development of atherosclerosis 
      and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was 
      to compare the coronary plaque characteristics of patients with and without CKD 
      using optical coherence tomography. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 463 
      nonculprit plaques from 287 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 
      optical coherence tomography registry. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). A total of 402 plaques (250 patients) were 
      in the non-CKD group and 61 plaques (37 patients) were in the CKD group. Compared 
      with non-CKD plaques, plaques with CKD had a larger lipid index (mean lipid 
      arc×lipid length, 1248.4±782.8 mm° [non-CKD] versus 1716.1±1116.2 mm° [CKD]; 
      P=0.003). Fibrous cap thickness was not significantly different between the groups. 
      Calcification (34.8% [non-CKD] versus 50.8% [CKD]; P=0.041), cholesterol crystals 
      (11.2% [non-CKD] versus 23.0% [CKD]; P=0.048), and plaque disruption (5.5% [non-CKD] 
      versus 13.1% [CKD]; P=0.049) were more frequently observed in the CKD group. In the 
      multivariate linear regression model, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for a larger lipid index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-CKD patients, the patients with CKD had a larger 
      lipid index with a higher prevalence of calcium, cholesterol crystals, and plaque 
      disruption. The multivariate linear regression model demonstrated that a lower 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate was an independent risk factor for a larger 
      lipid index.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in kidney 
      transplant recipients (KTRs). Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is a major risk 
      factor for cardiovascular disease in KTRs. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      long-term outcomes of AoAC in KTRs. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated AoAC in 
      KTRs between 2000 and 2010 using chest radiography. AoAC was semiquantitatively 
      estimated by calculating calcification score. Associations between clinical and 
      biochemical parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 258 patients were 
      enrolled; the mean age was 40.7 years, and 135 (52.3%) were males. Diabetes mellitus 
      was present in 28 (10.9%), and deceased donor kidney transplantation (KT) had been 
      performed in 95 (36.8%). Fifty-three (20.5%) patients had AoAC at the time of KT, 
      with an AoAC score of 0.8 ± 2.0. The proportion of KTRs with AoAC gradually 
      increased to 23.3%, 26.4%, and 28.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, after KT. 
      The AoAC score also gradually increased to 1.0 ± 2.3, 1.2 ± 2.8, and 1.6 ± 3.1, 
      respectively, at 1, 3, and 5 years after KT. The 10-year graft survival rate was 
      83.2% in the AoAC group and 85.1% in the non-AoAC group. The 10-year patient 
      survival rate was 90.6% in the AoAC group and 95.7% in the non-AoAC group. In 
      multivariate analysis, age at KT, deceased-donor KT, and diabetes mellitus were 
      independent predictors for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: AoAC is an independent 
      predictor of poor cardiovascular outcome in KTRs. Age and dialysis duration were 
      independent risk factors for AoAC. Age at KT, deceased-donor KT, and diabetes 
      mellitus were independent predictors for all-cause mortality. Regular follow-up by 
      chest radiography could be a simple and useful method to screen for AoAC and reduce 
      cardiovascular mortality.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score among several vascular calcification scores of 
      plain radiograph is the most reliable predictor of severe coronary artery 
      calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 729-735
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2017.1398666 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) score on computed tomography (CT) or 
      vascular calcification (VC) scores on plain radiographs are associated with 
      cardiovascular events and fracture. We investigated which VC score among several VC 
      scores on plain radiographs is predictor of CAC, and whether VC scores are related 
      with bone mineral density (BMD) in dialysis patients. METHODS: We checked several 
      plain radiographs (hands and pelvis [HP], feet and lateral lumbar spine), BMD and 
      multidetector CT scans of 55 patients maintaining dialysis in this cross-sectional 
      study. We analyzed data to find predictors for severe CAC which was defined as CAC 
      scores >400 on CT. RESULTS: Patients with severe CAC on CT had a higher proportion 
      of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score ≥5, HP score ≥3 and feet ≥1 than those 
      without severe CAC. The CAC score on CT was positively correlated with all VC scores 
      on plain radiographs. The AAC and CAC scores were negatively correlated with 
      T-scores for the BMD at the forearm and positively correlated with osteoprotegerin 
      levels. Among several VC scores on plain radiographs, the AAC ≥5 were independently 
      associated with severe CAC on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Several plain radiographs evaluating 
      VC scores, including a lateral lumbar spine view at the very least, can replace CT 
      checking CAC score in dialysis patients. The AAC score ≥5 may not only reveal severe 
      CAC but also give a hint of low bone mass at the forearm.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a predictor of poor survival and 
      cardiovascular outcome in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; however, there is 
      scarce information of VC in Latin America, and virtually no data in our setting. We 
      undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of VC in a 
      hemodialysis (HD) population from western Mexico and to determine possible 
      associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed in 52 
      patients. VC was evaluated using plain X-ray films (Adragao's score) of hands and 
      pelvis; clinical and biochemical variables were also collected. Statistical analysis 
      was carried out with Student t and χ(2) tests performed as appropriate and logistic 
      regression to determine predictors of VC. RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years, 48% were 
      female, 23% had diabetes mellitus (DM), and median time on dialysis was 46 months. 
      Percentage prevalence was 52% with a mean calcification score of 2.0 ± 2.6; 23% of 
      patients had severe calcification. VC was present in about 23-37% among the 
      different vascular territories evaluated (radial, digital, femoral and iliac). 
      Patients with calcification were significantly older, had a higher frequency of DM, 
      higher alkaline phosphatase and lower HDL lipoproteins than those without VC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, VC in these patients was significantly predicted only by an 
      older age (OR [95% CI]: 1.15 [1.01-1.31], p = 0.04); lower HDL-cholesterol and 
      higher alkaline phosphatase were marginal predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Half of our HD 
      patients had VC. Territories of radial, iliac, femoral and digital arteries were 
      roughly equally affected, and 25% of patients had a calcification considered as 
      severe. Older age was the only significant predicting variable for VC, with low 
      HDL-cholesterol and high alkaline phosphatase as marginal predictors.

      With Severe Artery Calcification.
PG  - 519-529

AB  - We studied the correlations between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level and 
      radial artery calcification (RAC) assessed histologically and carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). Moreover, we studied the relationship between OPG 
      levels and all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality during a 5-year observation 
      period. The study comprised 59 CKD patients (36 hemodialyzed (HD), 23 predialysis). 
      The biochemical parameters included: creatinine, calcium, phosphate, intact 
      parathormone, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor II 
      (TNFRII), transforming growth factor-β, hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23, osteonectin (ON), osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin. CCA-IMT 
      and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by ultrasound. Fragments of 
      radial artery obtained during creation of HD access were prepared for microscopy and 
      stained for calcifications with alizarin red. RAC was detected in 34 patients (58%). 
      In multiple regression adjusted for dialysis status, TNFRII, ON and Framingham risk 
      score (FRS) were identified as the independent predictors of OPG. Serum OPG above 
      the median value of 7.55 pmol/L significantly predicted the presence of RAC in 
      simple logistic regression (OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.39-20.4; P = 0.012) and in multiple 
      logistic regression adjusted for FRS, dialysis status and CCA-IMT values (OR 6.56; 
      95%CI 1.06-40.6; P = 0.036). OPG levels above the median were associated with higher 
      CCA-IMT values (1.02 ± 0.10 vs. 0.86 ± 0.13; P < 0.001) and predicted the presence 
      of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery (OR 14.4; 95%CI 2.84-72.9; P < 0.001), 
      independently of FRS, dialysis status and RAC. In this study, elevated serum OPG 
      levels correlated with higher CCA-IMT, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and 
      the severity of the RAC independently of each other. During follow-up, 25 patients 
      (42%) died, including 21 due to CV causes. In multiple Cox regression, OPG above the 
      median predicted overall survival independently of dialysis status, Framingham risk 
      score, CCA-IMT above the median value, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques 
      in CCA, but not independently of RAC. We postulate that circulating OPG may play a 
      dual role as a marker for both medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis, 
      hence it seems to be a valuable tool for assessing CV risk in patients with CKD. OPG 
      might be an early indicator of all-cause mortality in CKD patients with advanced 
      medial arterial calcification.

AB  - While vascular calcification is an important factor regulating prognosis in dialysis 
      patients, its components have not been adequately studied. We analyzed in vivo 
      components of calcification in the coronary arteries of dialysis patients using the 
      effective atomic number from dual-energy computed tomography. In dialysis patients 
      (hemodialysis, N = 10; peritoneal dialysis, N = 12), average of median effective 
      atomic number was 13.8 in the hemodialysis group, and 13.7 in the peritoneal 
      dialysis group. No significant differences were seen between groups, with calcium 
      oxalate monohydrate identified as the most common component in each. To confirm the 
      accuracy of this method, we investigated the composition of surgically removed 
      calcified tissues using already established methods. Comparison with the effective 
      atomic number from dual-energy computed tomography showed that the results of 
      calcification analysis were the same. We concluded that calcium oxalate monohydrate 
      might be one of the major components of coronary artery calcification in dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Effect of Sodium Thiosulfate on Arterial Stiffness in End-Stage Renal Disease 
      Patients Undergoing Chronic Hemodialysis (Sodium Thiosulfate-Hemodialysis Study): A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 219-227
LID - 10.1159/000488009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness (AS) and vascular calcification are significantly 
      related to a high cardiovascular mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (IV STS) can prevent and delay the vascular 
      calcification progression in uremic states; however, the STS effect on AS has not 
      been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the STS efficacy on vascular 
      calcification and AS in HD patients. METHODS: Fifty HD patients with abnormal AS, as 
      measured via the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI ≥8), were prospectively 
      randomized to open-label 12.5 g IV STS during the last HD hour twice weekly for 6 
      months (n = 24) or the usual care (control group; n = 26). Patients and treating 
      physicians were not blinded. The CAVI, coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, 
      hemodynamics, and biochemical parameters were measured at the baseline and at 3 and 
      6 months. RESULTS: All the baseline parameters were comparable. The IV STS 
      significantly reduced the CAVI when compared to the control group (mean CAVI 
      difference = -0.53; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.06; p = 0.03). A significant CAVI improvement 
      was seen in those patients without diabetes mellitus. The natural logarithm of the 
      CAC volume score was significantly increased in the control group. The high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein level was slightly lowered in the IV STS group (not 
      significant). CONCLUSION: The intradialytic STS treatment significantly reduced the 
      AS, as measured by the CAVI, and stabilized the vascular calcification in the HD 
      patients. STS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for delaying and treating the 
      structural and functional vascular wall abnormalities in HD patients.

      Calcification in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      physiological levels of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (phytate) and cardiovascular (CV) 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted from December 2012 to 
      June 2013. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients with CKD who were not 
      undergoing renal replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: All subjects were given lateral 
      lumbar X-rays to quantify abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). Clinical laboratory 
      analyses and phytate food frequency questionnaires were also performed. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Phytate urinary excretion, estimated phytate consumption (based on food 
      frequency questionnaire) and AAC score. Patients were divided into two groups based 
      on median abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score: no/mild AAC (AAC ≤ 6, n = 35) 
      and moderate/severe AAC (AAC > 6, n = 34). RESULTS: Patients with no/mild AAC were 
      younger, had lower pulse pressure, greater dietary intake of phytate, greater 
      urinary phytate and the prevalence of prior CV disease was significantly lower 
      compared to patients with moderate/severe AAC. Among the top 10 phytate-rich foods, 
      lentil consumption was significantly greater in patients with no/mild AAC than in 
      those with moderate/severe AAC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated 
      that age, prior CV disease, urinary phytate (or lentil consumption) were 
      independently associated to AAC. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adequate 
      consumption of phytate can prevent AAC in patients with CKD. Further prospective 
      studies must be performed to elucidate the benefits of a phytate-rich diet and the 
      associated risk of phosphorus bioavailability in these patients.

TI  - Surgical Techniques and Procedures for Kidney Transplant Recipients With Severe 
      Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 594-601
LID - 10.6002/ect.2016.0207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is becoming a more common problem for dialysis patients. 
      Therefore, transplant surgeons are faced with the need to develop surgical 
      techniques and procedures for severe atherosclerosis. This study aimed to clarify 
      the clinical features, the usefulness of examinations, and operative procedures for 
      kidney transplant recipients with the complication of severe atherosclerosis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 220 kidney transplant candidates, 13 patients (severe 
      atherosclerosis group) were predicted complications due to arterial calcification in 
      the bilateral iliac arterial system using a computed tomographic scan. They were 
      compared with the remaining 207 patients (mild atherosclerosis group) based on 
      patient characteristics. The severe atherosclerosis group was evaluated by 
      additional examination, anastomosis procedure of the graft artery, and patient 
      outcome. RESULTS: The severe atherosclerosis group had significantly higher rates of 
      mean recipient age, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, past smoking, and administration of 
      antithrombotics. Past vascular surgery related to atherosclerosis in the aortoiliac 
      region had been performed in 8 patients from the severe atherosclerosis group. A 
      three-dimensional computed tomography angiography and an intraoperative periarterial 
      echography were useful to determine the kidney transplant site. A balloon catheter 
      effectively blocked blood flow. A polytetrafluoroethylene vascular graft was used 
      for bypass between the graft artery and abdominal aorta. All kidney grafts of the 
      severe atherosclerosis group were functioning well. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant 
      for patients with severe atherosclerosis can be achieved successfully by additional 
      examinations and vascular surgical techniques.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vascular calcification can predict cardiovascular (CV) morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the prevalence, 
      association factors, and outcomes of chest X-ray-detected aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We included 190 
      patients undergoing PD (mean age, 52.6 ± 14.3 years) for whom chest radiographs were 
      available. AoAC revealed by chest X-ray was graded from 0 to 3 according to an AoAC 
      score (AoACS). Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the factors 
      associated with AoACS. After adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      mean blood pressure, and history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading 
      and mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard 
      model. RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001), PD duration (p = 0.004), history of CV disease 
      (p < 0.001), and renal Kt/V (p = 0.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean 
      follow-up of 55.1 ± 32.1 months, patients with Grade 2 (p = 0.011) or Grade 3 
      (p < 0.001) AoAC had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In 
      addition, patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than 
      those with Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (p = 0.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.736; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; p = 0.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HR = 3.289; 95% 
      CI, 1.156-9.359; p = 0.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality after 
      adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HR = 36.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; 
      p = 0.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment. CONCLUSION: 
      In patients undergoing PD, CXR-detected severe AoAC was an independent risk factor 
      for all-cause and CV mortalities.

TI  - Effects of Lanthanum Carbonate on Coronary Artery Calcification and Cardiac 
      Abnormalities After Initiating Hemodialysis.

AB  - It is known that calcium-containing phosphate binders are more closely associated 
      with the progression of vascular calcification than non-calcium-containing phosphate 
      binders. In this study, we investigated the effect of the non-calcium-containing 
      phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate on the progression of coronary artery 
      calcification and cardiovascular abnormalities compared to that of 
      calcium-containing phosphate binder in chronic kidney disease patients during the 
      early period after initiating hemodialysis. This was a randomized open-label study 
      in which patients were divided into the calcium carbonate or lanthanum carbonate 
      group. We evaluated blood samples, coronary artery calcification using 
      high-resolution computed tomography, and cardiac abnormalities using 
      echocardiography prior to and after initiating hemodialysis. Cardiac dimension and 
      systolic function were significantly improved in the lanthanum carbonate group 
      compared to those in the calcium carbonate group. Although statistically significant 
      differences were not observed in all the patients, only among patients with moderate 
      coronary artery calcification, the changes in coronary artery calcification score at 
      18 months were significantly smaller in the lanthanum carbonate group than those in 
      the calcium carbonate group. The percent change in coronary artery calcification at 
      18 months was significantly correlated with the serum fibroblast growth factor 23 
      levels at 18 months (r = 0.245, P < 0.05). This significant correlation was 
      particularly strong in patients with moderate coronary artery calcification 
      (r = 0.593, P < 0.001). Our study suggests that lanthanum carbonate ameliorates 
      cardiac abnormalities, and may slow coronary artery calcification development in 
      patients with moderate coronary artery calcification, during the early period 
      following hemodialysis initiation.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the role of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in 
      vascular calcification of patients with chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: The inferior 
      epigastric arteries were obtained from 23 patients on chronic haemodialysis and 16 
      patients with renal carcinoma as control. Haematoxylin-eosin staining, elastic fibre 
      staining, Alizarin Red calcium staining and immunohistochemical staining of PTHrP, 
      bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), Cbfa1/Runx2 were performed. Real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine mRNA expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 
      and Cbfa1/Runx2. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the effects of 
      PTHrP-siRNA and rh-PTHrP-1-34 on the expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 and Cbfa1/Runx2 in 
      human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and 
      intracellular calcium content in HASMCs were assessed after treatment with 10 mmol/L 
      β-glycerol phosphoric acid for 48 h. RESULTS: Vascular calcification was confirmed 
      in 78.2% of patients on chronic haemodialysis, and the expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 
      and Cbfa1 in the arteries were significantly upregulated. PTHrP-siRNA could 
      downregulate the expression of PTHrP by 60%, BMP-2 by 25% and Cbfa1 by 25% at 24 h 
      (P < 0.05). Exogenous rh-PTHrP-1-34 could upregulate the expressions of BMP-2 and 
      Cbfa1 by 1.37-fold and 1.46-fold, respectively, at 24 h in a time-independent manner 
      (P < 0.05), which were attenuated by PTHrP-siRNA. Moreover, it could promote 
      intracellular calcium deposition and increase ALP activities, which were partially 
      blocked by PTHrP-siRNA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular calcification was common in 
      patients with chronic haemodialysis, to which PTHrP might contribute by activating 
      BMP-2/ Cbfa1 signalling pathway.

TI  - Upper limb vascular calcification score as a predictor of mortality in diabetic 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular 
      calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (Mönckeberg disease). 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs 
      and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) 
      creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications 
      outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for 
      ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white 
      echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then 
      applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits 
      (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained 
      ≥ 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum 
      calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was 
      compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a 
      high VcS ≥ 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier 
      statistics were used for comparisons among the groups. RESULTS: Nineteen patients 
      had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS ≥ 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a 
      mean age of 68 ± 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to 
      a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central 
      venous catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 
      ± 41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 ± 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months), and 
      66.7 ± 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009). Forty-seven 
      patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in the controls; P 
      = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%, 65.7%, 54.8%, and 
      48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II; and 97.7%, 93.1%, 
      76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 for all groups; P = 
      .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or without CVCs at 
      baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc had lower survival 
      rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%) and at 3 years (47.7% vs 
      75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of death only in subgroup II 
      patients compared with the subcontrol group patients (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, 
      respectively; P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic hemodialysis patients exposed to high 
      levels of upper extremity arterial medial VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased 
      long-term mortality risk compared with diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and 
      receiving the same access. Patients with CVCs/Vc had the lowest survival rates.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin as a predictor of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in renal 
      transplant recipients: follow-up data from the ALERT study.
PG  - 2571-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic kidney disease, vascular calcification 
      contributes to increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. CV risk 
      remains high after successful renal transplantation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a 
      glycoprotein, involved in the regulation of the vascular calcification process. 
      Previous studies have shown that elevated OPG is predictive of mortality in 
      high-risk populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value 
      of OPG for graft function, CV events and all-cause death, in a large transplant 
      cohort. METHODS: OPG was measured at baseline in renal transplant recipients 
      enrolled in the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) study, a 
      randomized placebo-controlled intervention study comparing fluvastatin and placebo. 
      Patients were followed for 6.7 years with evaluation of pre-specified end points, 
      graft loss, graft function, CV events and death. RESULTS: OPG was analysed in 1889 
      renal transplant recipients, with a mean value of 4.69 ± 1.85 pg/L. The number of 
      renal and CV events increased by quartiles of OPG. In the multivariate analysis, OPG 
      in the fourth as compared to first quartile was an independent predictor of graft 
      failure or doubling of serum creatinine [hazard ratio (HR) 2.20 (1.56-3.11), P < 
      0.001], major CV events [HR 2.40 (1.58-3.64), P < 0.001], cardiac mortality [HR 2.80

TI  - Assessment of abdominal aortic calcification at different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 2061-2068
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcifications that may cause cardiovascular disease are highly 
      prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to determine 
      abdominal aorta calcifications (AAC) in predialysis and hemodialysis patients by 
      lateral lumbar radiography and to investigate factors that were associated with the 
      calcifications. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-nine adult chronic hemodialysis 
      patients, 300 predialysis CKD patients and 60 healthy subjects with normal kidney 
      function as a control group were enrolled in the study. Lateral lumbar radiography 
      was used to measure AAC. Calcified deposits of the abdominal aorta wall at the level 
      of the first through fourth lumbar vertebrae were graded by a 24-point scoring 
      system. RESULTS: AAC prevalence (AAC score ≥1) was significantly different in 
      hemodialysis, predialysis and control groups (71.8, 45.7 and 33.3 %, respectively; 
      p < 0.001). AAC prevalence in CKD stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 predialysis patients was 
      26.6, 43.3, 40, 58.3 and 55 %, respectively. AAC scores of the hemodialysis group 
      were higher than of the predialysis group (p < 0.001) and the control group 
      (p < 0.001). AAC scores of the predialysis group were not higher than of the control 
      group (p = 0.314). AAC scores of the hemodialysis group were significantly higher 
      than of the control group (p < 0.001) and stage 1 (p < 0.001), stage 2 (p = 0.001) 
      and stage 3 predialysis groups (p = 0.002). Age (p < 0.001), presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (p < 0.001) and serum phosphorus levels (p = 0.011) were found to be 
      independent predictors of calcification in the hemodialysis group. Age (p < 0.001), 
      serum phosphorus levels (p = 0.007) and history of cardiovascular disease 
      (p = 0.014) were found to be independent predictors of calcification in the 
      predialysis group. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal aortic calcification is highly prevalent 
      in the hemodialysis population. Strict phosphorus control should be implemented to 
      the predialysis and hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Lower serum magnesium is associated with vascular calcification in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a cross sectional study.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12882-017-0549-y [doi]
LID - 129
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent among dialysis 
      patients and is associated with increased cardiovascular and all cause mortality. 
      Magnesium (Mg) inhibits vascular calcification in animal and in-vitro studies but 
      whether the same effect occurs in humans is uncertain. METHODS: A single centre 
      cross-sectional study of 80 prevalent peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients; on PD only 
      for a minimum of 3 months. A radiologist blinded to patient status calculated their 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) scores on lateral lumbar spine radiographs, a 
      validated surrogate for CAC. RESULTS: Eighty patients provided informed consent and 
      underwent lumbar spine radiography. The mean serum Mg was 0.8 mmol/L (standard 
      deviation 0.2) and mean AAC score 8.9 (minimum 0, maximum 24). A higher serum Mg 
      level was associated with a lower AAC score (R (2) = 0.06, unstandardized 
      coefficient [B] = -7.81, p = 0.03), and remained after adjustment for age, serum 
      phosphate, serum parathyroid hormone, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking 
      history, and diabetes (model adjusted R (2) = 0.36, serum Mg and AAC score 
      B = -11.44, p = 0.00). This translates to a 0.1 mmol/L increase in serum Mg being 
      independently associated with a 1.1-point decrease in AAC score. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that Mg may inhibit vascular calcification. If this association is 
      replicated across larger studies with serial Mg and vascular calcification 
      measurements, interventions that increase serum Mg and their effect on vascular 
      calcification warrant further investigation in the PD population.

TI  - Vascular calcification on plain radiographs is related with the severity of lesions 
      detected by coronary angiography in dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1620/tjem.235.135 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity in 
      dialysis patients. However, it is difficult to select the proper point for coronary 
      angiographic procedure, because dialysis patients frequently do not display typical 
      symptoms. Vascular calcification (VC) scores of artery or aorta on plain radiographs 
      are associated with CAD events and may be predictive of CAD in dialysis patients. 
      Therefore, we evaluated whether high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs 
      are related with the severity of lesions detected by coronary angiography (CAG) in 
      dialysis patients. We retrospectively enrolled dialysis patients who underwent CAG 
      and checked several plain radiographs within one year before or after CAG. 
      Significant VC is defined as high or meaningful VC scores, such as long abdominal 
      aortic calcification and medial artery calcification on feet. Of all 55 patients, 41 
      patients (74.5%) exhibited significant VC on plain radiographs and 23 patients 
      (41.8%) underwent stent insertion. Among the 23 patients, longer stents were used in 
      18 patients with significant VC (34.1 ± 19.5 mm vs. 16.6 ± 15.2 mm, P = 0.029). 
      Patients with significant VC showed higher prevalence rate of severe coronary artery 
      calcification (P = 0.007) and diffuse/tubular stenosis (P = 0.012), detected by CAG, 
      than those without significant VC. Thus, high or meaningful VC scores on plain 
      radiographs were associated with the degree of calcification or stenosis detected by 
      CAG. In conclusion, VC scores on plain radiographs may be predictive of 
      calcification or stenosis of coronary artery before CAG in dialysis patients.

      study.
PG  - 144-50
LID - 10.1159/000362169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the long-term mortality and morbidity of living kidney donors 
      are scarce. In the general population, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and 
      progression of CAC are predictors of future cardiac risk. We conducted a study to 
      determine the progression of CAC in renal transplant donors. METHODS: We used 
      multidetector computed tomography to examine CAC in 75 former renal transplant 
      donors. A baseline and a follow-up scan were performed and changes in CAC scores 
      were evaluated in each subject individually to calculate the incidence of CAC 
      progression. RESULTS: Baseline CAC prevalence was 16% and the mean CAC score was 5.3 
      ± 25.8. At the follow-up scan that was performed after an average of 4.8 ± 0.3 
      years, CAC prevalence increased to 72% and the mean CAC score to 12.5 ± 23.4. 
      Progression of the individual CAC score was found between 18.7 and 26.7%, depending 
      on the method used to define progression. In patients with baseline CAC, the mean 
      annualized rate of CAC progression was 2.1. Presence of hypertension, high systolic 
      blood pressure and an increase in BMI were the determinants of CAC progression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The rate of CAC progression does not seem to be high in carefully 
      selected donors.

TI  - High-Flux Hemodialysis Benefits Hemodialysis Patients by Reducing Serum FGF-23 
      Levels and Reducing Vascular Calcification.
PG  - 3467-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: High- and low-flux hemodialysis (HFHD and LFHD, respectively) are 
      dialysis procedures designed to eliminate blood toxins that accumulate in end-stage 
      renal disease. HFHD may reduce vascular calcification by removing serum fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 (FGF-23). However, whether HFHD is better than LFHD is still under 
      debate. We therefore compared the efficacy of HFHD and LFHD in controlling FGF-23 
      and vascular calcification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty hemodialysis patients were 
      recruited and randomly treated with either HFHD or LFHD. Fasting venous blood was 
      collected at baseline, six months, and twelve months after the treatment. We then 
      measured levels of FGF-23, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline 
      phosphatase. Further, abdominal lateral radiographs were taken to calculate aorta 
      abdominalis calcification scores (AACs). RESULTS: Compared to the LFHD group, FGF-23 
      and AACs in the HFHD group significantly decreased after 12 months treatment 
      (p=0.049 and p=0.002, respectively). AACs were positively correlated with FGF-23 in 
      all patients (p=0.004), the HFHD group alone (p=0.040), and the LFHD group alone 
      (p=0.037). We also found that older patients, patients with higher blood phosphorus 
      levels, and higher FGF-23 levels had an increased risk of aorta abdominalis 
      calcification (p=0.048, p=0.003, p=0.001, respectively). HFHD was more able to 
      reduce the risk of aorta abdominalis calcification than LFHD (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: 
      FGF-23 is an independent risk factor for the development of vascular calcification. 
      HFHD may benefit hemodialysis patients by reducing serum FGF-23 levels and 
      controlling vascular calcification.

TI  - The Addition of Vascular Calcification Scores to Traditional Risk Factors Improves 
      Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a variety of non-invasive methods for measuring cardiovascular 
      (CV) risk (such as carotid intima media thickness, pulse wave velocity (PWV), 
      coronary artery and aortic calcification scores (measured either by CT scan or 
      X-ray) and the ankle brachial index (ABI)) have been evaluated separately in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) cohorts, few studies have evaluated these methods 
      simultaneously. Here, we looked at whether the addition of non-invasive methods to 
      traditional risk factors (TRFs) improves prediction of the CV risk in patients at 
      different CKD stages. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 
      the relationship between the outputs of non-invasive measurement methods on one hand 
      and mortality and CV outcomes in 143 patients at different CKD stages on the other. 
      During the follow-up period, 44 patients died and 30 CV events were recorded. We 
      used Cox models to calculate the relative risk for outcomes. To assess the putative 
      clinical value of each method, we also determined the categorical net 
      reclassification improvement (NRI) and the integrated discrimination improvement. 
      RESULTS: Vascular calcification, PWV and ABI predicted all-cause mortality and CV 
      events in univariate analyses. However, after adjustment for TRFs, only aortic and 
      coronary artery calcification scores were found to be significant, independent 
      variables. Moreover, the addition of coronary artery calcification scores to TRFs 
      improved the specificity of prediction by 20%. CONCLUSION: The addition of vascular 
      calcification scores (especially the coronary artery calcification score) to TRFs 
      appears to improve CV risk assessment in a CKD population.

TI  - Effects of phosphorus-restricted diet and phosphate-binding therapy on outcomes in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 73-80
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0071-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphorus is associated with mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) not on dialysis, possibly through phosphorus-dependent vascular 
      calcification. Although a phosphorus-restricted diet reduces serum phosphorus, it is 
      unlikely that it reduces vascular calcification progression in CKD. This study 
      evaluated whether a combined strategy of phosphorus-restricted diet and 
      phosphate-binding therapy can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and/or dialysis 
      initiation by attenuating coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of 
      patients from a study that evaluated the impact of two phosphorus binder regimens on 
      hard outcomes in CKD. Patients (n = 113) with stage 3-4 CKD and evidence of CAC on a 
      phosphorus-restricted diet were randomized to receive either calcium carbonate or 
      sevelamer added to their phosphorus-restricted diet. End-points were death for any 
      cause and initiation of dialysis. Patients were monitored to the first event or to 
      conclusion of the 36-month follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, treatment with calcium 
      carbonate was associated with increased CAC progression and occurrence of all-cause 
      mortality, dialysis initiation, and the composite end-point. After adjustment for 
      confounders, sevelamer use was the only independent predictive factor of reduced 
      risk of each endpoint but only if CAC progression was either absent or moderate. 
      Accelerated progression (annual CAC increase >75th percentile of the study cohort) 
      increased the risk of all-cause mortality and composite end-point (p = 0.01) 
      independently of the use of sevelamer. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in 
      all-cause mortality, dialysis initiation, and composite end-point risk was achieved 
      by combining phosphorus-restricted diet and sevelamer in non-dialysis CKD patients 
      with absent or moderate but not accelerated CAC progression. Future studies should 
      investigate the role of serum phosphorus, the usefulness of a phosphorus-restricted 
      diet, and the appropriateness of current normal ranges of serum phosphorus 
      concentration in relation to events in non-dialyzed CKD patients.

TI  - Effect of essential amino acid кetoanalogues and protein restriction diet on 
      morphogenetic proteins (FGF-23 and Кlotho) in 3b-4 stages chronic кidney disease 
      patients: a randomized pilot study.
PG  - 1351-1359
LID - 10.1007/s10157-018-1591-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low protein diet (LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue 
      supplementation (KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      while the exact mechanisms of KA's effect are not established yet. We have conducted 
      a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of LPD + KA and LPD alone in 
      relation to serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels in CKD patients. METHODS: 79 non-diabetic 
      CKD 3b-4 stage patients, compliant with LPD diet (0.6 g/kg of body weight/day), had 
      been selected. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group (42 
      patients) received LPD + КA. The second group (37 patients) continued the LРD alone. 
      In addition to routine tests, serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels, as well as bioimpedance 
      analysis, sphygmography (stiffness (augmentation) indices (AI), central (aortal) 
      blood pressure) with a «SphygmaCor» device; echocardiography (valvular calcification 
      score (VCS) and LVMMI), were performed. RESULTS: There were body mass indices' 
      decrease (p = 0.046), including muscle body mass in men (p = 0.027) and woman 
      (p = 0.044) in the LPD group to the end of study (14th month). In addition, lower 
      FGF-23 (p = 0.029), and higher sKlotho (p = 0.037) were detected in the LPD + KA 
      group compared to the LPD one. The increase in AI (p = 0.034), VCS (p = 0.048), and 
      LVMMI (p = 0.023) was detected more often in the LPD group at the end of study. 
      CONCLUSION: LPD + KA provides support for nutrition status and contributes to more 
      efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities that may result in 
      cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD. At the same 
      time, a prolonged LPD alone may lead to malnutrition.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. We evaluated 126 asymptomatic CKD patients (mean estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate: 36.1 ± 14.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), mean age 
      70.3 ± 10.1 years). A non-contrast computed tomography scan was used to determine 
      the abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) and CAC score, and this relationship 
      was investigated. Among the subjects, AAC was present in 109 patients (86.5 %) as 
      defined by ACI >0 and median ACI was 11.7 %. ACI increased in accordance with 
      advances in CAC score grades (3.0, 5.2, 17.2, and 32.8 % for CAC score 0, 1-100, 
      101-400, and 401 or more, respectively, p < 0.001). Even after multivariate 
      adjustment, ACI was independently associated with severe CAC score as defined by CAC 
      score >400 [odds ratio 1.08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.12, p < 0.001]. 
      Receiver-operating curve analysis showed that the ACI optimal cut-off value 
      predicting severe CAC score was 16.5 % (area under the curve = 0.79, 95 % CI 
      0.69-0.90, p < 0.001). The C statics for predicting CAC score was significantly 
      increased by adding ACI values to the model including other risk factors (0.853 
      versus 0.737, p = 0.023). In conclusion, the ACI value of 16.5 % allows us to 
      predict the presence of severe CAC in CKD patients, and that the addition of ACI to 
      the model with traditional risk factors significantly improves the predictive 
      ability of severe CAC score. These data reinforce the utility of ACI as a screening 
      tool in clinical practice.

TI  - Cinacalcet chloride is efficient and safe in renal transplant recipients with 
      posttransplant hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 675-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is observed in approximately 50% of 
      kidney transplant recipients one year after transplantation. It may result in 
      hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, bone demineralization, vascular calcification, 
      lithiasis, and participate in chronic allograft nephropathy. We evaluated the use of 
      the calcimimetic cinacalcet chloride to correct chronic hypercalcemia in 
      posttransplant HPT, in a prospective single-center study. METHODS: Nine patients 
      with persistent hypercalcemia (>2.6 mmol/L) and stable graft function were treated 
      with cinacalcet (30 mg/day, thereafter adapted to obtain normal serum Ca levels) for 
      six months. Their immunosuppressive schedule included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 
      steroids, and cyclosporine A (4), tacrolimus (4), or sirolimus (2). RESULTS: Serum 
      Ca levels significantly decreased from 2.75+/-0.15 to 2.59+/-0.10, 2.42+/-0.29 and 
      2.44+/-0.25 mmol/L by one, two, and six months, respectively (P<0.02, Wilcoxon test 
      for paired data, for all the data points). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum levels 
      decreased from 171+/-102 to 134+/-63 pg/ml by two months (P<0.05) and stabilized 
      thereafter (148+/-99 pg/ml at six months; NS). No changes in glomerular filtration 
      rate (49.8+/-18.6 and 51.3+/-19 ml/min at initiation and six months, respectively) 
      and no variation in serum concentration of the immunosuppressive drugs were 
      observed. Three patients withdrew the treatment because gastrointestinal 
      intolerance. CONCLUSION: Cinacalcet allows the correction of hypercalcemia with no 
      interference in immunosuppressive treatment or renal function. However, whether the 
      increased intolerance observed was due to the association of cinacalcet chloride 
      with other drugs required in renal transplantation (e.g., MMF) needs to be assessed.

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to 
      exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess 
      characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 
      124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent 
      patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were 
      compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. 
      Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, 
      and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area 
      stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean 
      calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3° 
      vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments 
      (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. 
      There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium 
      >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 
      4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the 
      HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial 
      calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, 
      HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more 
      extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of 
      non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an 
      overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to 
      the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with 
      long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.

TI  - Comparison of fetuin-A, vitamin D, monounsaturated fatty acid, and vascular 
      calcification on plain radiography between dialysis modalities.
PG  - 453-60
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Low fetuin-A and vitamin D and high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) 
      contents are associated with vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients. We 
      aimed to demonstrate the difference in fetuin-A, vitamin D, MUFA, and VC on plain 
      radiography between patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We recruited 31 hemodialysis and 30 PD patients. We examined plain 
      radiography of the feet, hands, pelvis, and lateral lumbar spine and defined 
      significant VC as abdominal aortic calcifications scores of 5 and higher, VC scores 
      of the hands and pelvis of 3 and higher, or arterial media calcifications of the 
      feet on plain radiography. RESULTS: The mean age, dialysis duration, and prevalence 
      of VC on plain radiography were not significantly different in PD patients compared 
      to hemodialysis patients. However, fetuin-A and MUFA were significantly higher, 
      whereas serum albumin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were significantly lower in PD 
      patients compared to hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis patients who demonstrated 
      significant VC on plain radiography had longer dialysis vintage, higher prevalence 
      of coronary artery disease, and higher MUFA than patients without significant VC. 
      Peritoneal dialysis patients who demonstrated significant VC on plain radiography 
      had lower fetuin-A levels and higher C-reactive protein than patients without 
      significant VC. Fetuin-A was an independent risk factor related with VC on plain 
      radiography in PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin-A, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and MUFA 
      were significantly different, although the prevalence of VC on plain radiography was 
      not different according to dialysis modality.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1111/nep.12210 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk 
      factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney 
      transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same 
      time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the 
      long-term. METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC 
      was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting 
      list. RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT 
      and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no 
      differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD 
      between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was 
      observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were 
      associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was 
      more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged 
      dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC 
      increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial 
      after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe 
      degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became 
      more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part 
      influenced by past dialysis experience.

TI  - Calcification in arteriovenous fistula blood vessels may predict arteriovenous 
      fistula failure: a 5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 881-887
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1515-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for 
      hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains 
      unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the 
      light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification 
      process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the 
      calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity. METHODS: The 
      study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a 
      mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent 
      primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic 
      region was detected using X-ray examination. RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood 
      vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis 
      demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of 
      AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of 
      AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these 
      standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels 
      calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 
      (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications of 
      AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize 
      the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method 
      for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be 
      monitored more closely.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify loci for coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). BACKGROUND: CKD is associated 
      with increased CAC and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms 
      remain poorly defined. Genetic studies of CAC in CKD may provide a useful strategy 
      for identifying novel pathways in CHD. METHODS: We performed a candidate gene study 
      (∼2,100 genes; ∼50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) of CAC within the 
      CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study (N = 1,509; 57% European, 43% 
      African ancestry). SNPs with preliminary evidence of association with CAC in CRIC 
      were examined for association with CAC in the PennCAC (Penn Coronary Artery 
      Calcification) (N = 2,560) and AFCS (Amish Family Calcification Study) (N = 784) 
      samples. SNPs with suggestive replication were further analyzed for association with 
      myocardial infarction (MI) in the PROMIS (Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction 
      Study) (N = 14,885). RESULTS: Of 268 SNPs reaching p < 5 × 10(-4) for CAC in CRIC, 
      28 SNPs in 23 loci had nominal support (p < 0.05 and in same direction) for CAC in 
      PennCAC or AFCS. Besides chr9p21 and COL4A1, known loci for CHD, these included SNPs 
      having reported genome-wide association study association with hypertension (e.g., 
      ATP2B1). In PROMIS, 4 of the 23 suggestive CAC loci (chr9p21, COL4A1, ATP2B1, and 
      ABCA4) had significant associations with MI, consistent with their direction of 
      effect on CAC. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several loci associated with CAC in CKD 
      that also relate to MI in a general population sample. CKD imparts a high risk of 
      CHD and may provide a useful setting for discovery of novel CHD genes and pathways.

AB  - AIM: To study the clinical significance of determining the serum concentration of 
      phosphorus and calcium metabolism regulators--the morphogenetic proteins FGF-23 and 
      Klotho in patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: The serum levels of FGF-23 (a human FGF-23 ELISA kit with full-length 
      anti-FCF-23 monoclonal antibodies) and Klotho (a human alpha-K1 ELISA with 
      anti-Klotno antibodies) were investigated in 70 patients with Stages I--VD CKD (41 
      patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, including 10 with nephritis in systemic 
      diseases, 22 with tubulointerstitial nephritis, and 7 with hypertensive 
      nephroslerosis). The morphogenetic proteins were studied by the specialists of the 
      LiTECH diagnostic laboratory according to the standard protocol. RESULTS: As CKD 
      progressed from Stage I to VD, there were increased FGF-23 concentrations and 
      decreased Klotho levels in the examinees' serum. The highest FGF-23 level and low 
      Klotho concentration were noted in the group of patients on regular hemodialysis 
      treatment (Stage VD). There was a strong inverse correlation between Klotho levels 
      and proteinuria, C-reactive protein, and protein-energy insufficiency, which 
      suggests that these factors influence the serum level of Klotho. The serum levels of 
      FGF-23 and intact parathyroid hormone correlated with these values to a lesser 
      degree. Analysis of the content of the morphogenetic proteins in patients with 
      anemia versus those with CKD of the same stages and target hemoglobin values 
      revealed low Klotho concentrations and high FGF-23 levels (r = 0.602; p < 0.01 and r 
      = -0.450; p < 0.01, respectively). Forty-nine hypertensive patients showed a direct 
      strong relationship between elevated serum FGF-23 levels and an inverse strong one 
      between the reduced serum Klotho levels and the increased posterior left ventricular 
      wall (r = 0.552; p < 0.01 and r = -0,587; p < 0.01, respectively). The same strong 
      association was found between the higher serum level of FCF-23 (r = 0.492; p < 0.01) 
      and the concentration of Klotho (r = -0.537; p < 0.01) and peripheral vascular 
      resistance index (as evidenced by Doppler ultrasound study). CONCLUSION: Along with 
      the active participation of the morphogenetic proteins (FGF-23 and Klotho) in 
      mineral metabolism and its disturbances in CKD, their role is apparent in the 
      development of cardiovascular events (in particular, through the involvement in the 
      processes of vascular calcification and cardiac remodeling), anemia (through the 
      possible effect on iron metabolism, enhanced ischemia of renal interstitial tissue 
      with impaired Klotho production), and protein-energy insufficiency (through the 
      participation in the processes of inflammation, oxidative stress, and protein 
      synthesis).

TI  - Vascular calcification and subendocardial ischemia in hemodialysis patients: a new 
      morpho-functional score to assess cardiovascular risk: the Solofra score.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: ESRD (end-stage renal disease) patients have a high cardiovascular 
      mortality risk. A morphofunctional approach of vascular calcifications and 
      myocardial perfusion is needed for the management of ESRD patients. We used SEVR 
      (sub-endocardial viability ratio) and Kauppila score from the dialysis population of 
      the Independent study to create a new morpho-functional score to assess 
      cardiovascular risk in this population (the Solofra score). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      184 patients were followed-up for 36 months. A side lumbar X-ray was performed to 
      assess vascular calcifications of lumbar aorta using the Kauppila score. Central 
      aortic pressure and pulse velocity wave (PWV) were assessed at the carotid artery 
      site. Myocardial perfusion was estimated with SEVR. Independent risk mortality 
      factors were identified with univariate regression analysis (p<0.01); significance 
      was defined as p<0.05. RESULTS: Kauppila score was 13±10(range 0-24); PWV was 9.5±4 
      m/sec; basal SEVR was 1.3±0.9. We observed an improvement of ROC curves for SEVR and 
      Kauppila score together compared to the ones for SEVR or Kauppila score alone. 
      CONCLUSION: A quantitative analysis of vascular calcifications should be associated 
      to a qualitative evaluation of arterial damage to better estimate cardiovascular 
      mortality risk of ESRD patients. Further studies are needed to verify our 
      hypothesis.

TI  - Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla protein concentration is predictive of 
      vitamin K status and is correlated with vascular calcification in a cohort of 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-15-145 [doi]
LID - 145
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is known to act as a potent local inhibitor of 
      vascular calcifications. However, in order to be active, MGP must be phosphorylated 
      and carboxylated, with this last process being dependent on vitamin K. The present 
      study focused on the inactive form of MGP (dephosphorylated and uncarboxylated: 
      dp-ucMGP) in a population of hemodialyzed (HD) patients. Results found in subjects 
      being treated or not with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) were compared and the 
      relationship between dp-ucMGP levels and the vascular calcification score were 
      assessed. METHODS: One hundred sixty prevalent HD patients were enrolled into this 
      observational cohort study, including 23 who were receiving VKA treatment. The 
      calcification score was determined (using the Kauppila method) and dp-ucMGP levels 
      were measured using the automated iSYS method. RESULTS: dp-ucMGP levels were much 
      higher in patients being treated with VKA and little overlap was found with those 
      not being treated (5604 [3758; 7836] vs. 1939 [1419; 2841] pmol/L, p < 0.0001). In 
      multivariate analysis, treatment with VKA was the most important variable explaining 
      variation in dp-ucMGP levels even when adjusting for all other significant 
      variables. In the 137 untreated patients, dp-ucMGP levels were significantly (p < 
      0.05) associated both in the uni- and multivariate analysis with age, body mass 
      index, plasma levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, and FGF-23, and the vascular 
      calcification score. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the concentration of dp-ucMGP was 
      higher in HD patients being treated with VKA. We observed a significant correlation 
      between dp-ucMGP concentration and the calcification score. Our data support the 
      theoretical role of MGP in the development of vascular calcifications. We confirmed 
      the potential role of the inactive form of MGP in assessing the vitamin K status of 
      the HD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: B707201215885.

TI  - Arteriovenous fistula aneurysm in patients on regular hemodialysis: prevalence and 
      risk factors.
PG  - 94-8
LID - 10.1159/000355548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Compared to all other complications, literature data about vascular 
      access aneurysm (VAA) are the scarcest. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to 
      evaluate the prevalence of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysms and to confirm the 
      risk factors for their appearance. METHODS: The presence, number and morphological 
      characteristics of AVF aneurysms were confirmed, and according to the score of AVF 
      aneurysm (the sum of the length and width in cm), patients were classified into 
      group 1 (score ≤12) and group 2 (score >12). Analysis included the last data from 
      the medical records including vascular calcifications score. RESULTS: Out of 181 
      patients, 150 with native fistula were included in this study. Aneurysmatic changes 
      were detected in 90 (60%) patients, and the majority had two or more aneurysms. VAA 
      were more frequent in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) than in 
      other diagnostic categories. By using forward stepwise logistic regression, we 
      confirmed that patients on high-flux hemodialysis (HD) had 5.3-fold higher risk, and 
      patients with diabetes mellitus had 5.8-fold less risk for developing AVF aneurysm. 
      While vascular calcification score did not influence the incidence of VAA, higher 
      PWV had significant negative influence on formation of AVF aneurysm (OR 1.25, 95% CI 
      1.003-1.56, p = 0.047). By ROC curve analysis, it was determined that patients who 
      were longer than 5.7 years on HD had greater risk for developing VAA (area = 0.741, 
      p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: This single-center study confirmed the very high prevalence 
      of VAA (60%). Aneurysms were more frequent in patients with ADPKD and in those who 
      had longer dialysis vintage on high-flux membranes with higher blood flow rate.

TI  - Vitamin K, vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality: VItamin K 
      Italian (VIKI) dialysis study.
PG  - 2271-8
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.1677 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K (vitamin K1 or phylloquinone and vitamin K2, a series of menaquinones 
      [MKs]) is involved in the production of bone and matrix amino acid 
      γ-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) proteins, regulating bone and vascular calcification. 
      Low vitamin K concentrations are associated with increased risks of fractures and 
      vascular calcification, and frequent complications in hemodialysis patients. We 
      carried out an observational study to establish the prevalence of vitamin K 
      deficiency and to assess the relationship between vitamin K status, vertebral 
      fractures, vascular calcification, and survival in 387 patients on hemodialysis for 
      ≥1 year. We determined plasma levels of vitamin K compound, bone-Gla-protein, 
      matrix-Gla-protein, and routine biochemistry. Vertebral fractures (reduction in 
      vertebral body height by ≥20%) and aortic and iliac calcifications were also 
      investigated in a spine (D(5) -L(4)) radiograph. Three-year patient survival was 
      analyzed. Important proportions of patients had deficiency of MK7 (35.4%), vitamin 
      K1 (23.5%), and MK4 (14.5%). A total of 55.3% of patients had vertebral fractures, 
      80.6% had abdominal aorta calcification, and 56.1% had iliac calcification. Vitamin 
      K1 deficiency was the strongest predictor of vertebral fractures (odds ratio [OR], 
      2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.26). MK4 deficiency was a predictor of 
      aortic calcification (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.14-7.01), whereas MK5 deficiency actually 
      protected against it (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.95). MK7 deficiency was a predictor 
      of iliac calcification (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.03-2.60). The presence of vertebral 
      fractures was also a predictor of vascular calcifications (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 
      1.00-3.08). Increased alkaline phosphatase and C reactive protein (CRP), age, and 
      cerebrovascular events were predictors of mortality. Our study suggests that the 
      vitamin K system may be important for preserving bone mass and avoiding vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients, pointing out a possible role of vitamin K in 
      bone and vascular health. Based on our results, we suggest that the general 
      population should also be studied for vitamin K deficiency as a possible cause of 
      both vertebral fractures and vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an important predictor 
      of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, 
      little is known regarding AAC progression in these patients. This study aimed to 
      identify risk factors associated with AAC progression in patients with CKD without 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: We recruited 141 asymptomatic patients with CKD without 
      hemodialysis [median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
      40.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] and evaluated the progression of the abdominal aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) over 3 years. To identify risk factors contributing to the 
      rate of ACI progression, the associations between baseline clinical characteristics 
      and annual change in ACI for each CKD category were analyzed. The annual change of 
      ACI (ΔACI/year) was calculated as follows: (second ACI - first ACI)/duration between 
      the two evaluations. RESULTS: Median ΔACI/year values significantly increased in 
      advanced CKD stages (0.73%, 0.87%, and 2.24%/year for CKD stages G1-2, G3, and G4-5, 
      respectively; p for trend = 0.041). The only independent risk factor for AAC 
      progression in mild to moderate CKD (G1-3, eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was pulse 
      pressure level (β = 0.258, p = 0.012). In contrast, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level 
      was significantly correlated with ΔACI/year (β = 0.426, p = 0.007) among patients 
      with advanced CKD (G4-5, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      suggests that the AAC progression rate was significantly accelerated in patients 
      with advanced CKD. In addition, measuring PTH is useful to evaluate both bone 
      turnover and AAC progression in patients with advanced CKD.

TI  - The Association of Coronary Artery Calcium With Noncardiovascular Disease: The 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 568-576

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if coronary artery calcium (CAC) is 
      associated with incident noncardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: CAC is considered a 
      measure of vascular aging, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. The relationship with noncardiovascular disease is not well 
      defined. METHODS: A total of 6,814 participants from 6 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis) field centers were followed for a median of 10.2 years. Modified 
      Cox proportional hazards ratios accounting for the competing risk of fatal coronary 
      heart disease were calculated for new diagnoses of cancer, pneumonia, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein 
      thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, and dementia. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age; sex; race; socioeconomic status; health insurance status; body mass index; 
      physical activity; diet; tobacco use; number of medications used; systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure; total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 
      antihypertensive, aspirin, and cholesterol medication; and diabetes. The outcome was 
      first incident noncardiovascular disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with those 
      with CAC = 0, those with CAC >400 had an increased hazard of cancer (hazard ratio 
      [HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 1.99), CKD (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.21 
      to 2.39), pneumonia (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.82), COPD (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.60 
      to 4.57), and hip fracture (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 1.47 to 12.50). CAC >400 was not 
      associated with dementia or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Those with 
      CAC = 0 had decreased risk of cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), CKD (HR: 
      0.77; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), COPD (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), and hip fracture 
      (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.70) compared to those with CAC >0. CAC = 0 was 
      not associated with less pneumonia, dementia, or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary 
      embolism. The results were attenuated, but remained significant, after removing 
      participants developing interim nonfatal coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants with elevated CAC were at increased risk of cancer, CKD, COPD, and hip 
      fractures. Those with CAC = 0 are less likely to develop common age-related comorbid 
      conditions, and represent a unique population of "healthy agers."

AB  - Chaga mushrooms are widely used in folk remedies and in alternative medicine. 
      Contrary to many beneficial effects, its adverse effect is rarely reported. We here 
      report a case of end-stage renal disease after long-term taking Chaga mushroom. A 
      49-year-old Korean man with end stage renal disease (ESRD) was transferred to our 
      hospital. Review of kidney biopsy finding was consistent with chronic 
      tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystal deposits and drug history revealed 
      long-term exposure to Chaga mushroom powder due to intractable atopic dermatitis. We 
      suspected the association between Chaga mushroom and oxalate nephropathy, and 
      measured the oxalate content of remained Chaga mushroom. The Chaga mushroom had 
      extremely high oxalate content (14.2/100 g). Estimated daily oxalate intake of our 
      case was 2 times for four years and 5 times for one year higher than that of usual 
      diet. Chaga mushroom is a potential risk factor of chronic kidney disease 
      considering high oxalate content. Nephrologist should consider oxalate nephropathy 
      in ESRD patients exposed to Chaga mushrooms.

      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In the general population lipid-rich plaques are prone to 
      rupture and healing of the plaque involves calcification. Patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis have a severe derangement of mineral metabolism and calcification of 
      the arterial tree may have different implications. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2005, 
      125 hemodialysis patients (60 men) underwent computed tomography imaging for 
      quantification of coronary artery calcium via the Agatston and the Volume methods. 
      Since the Agatston score is derived by multiplying the density by the volume of a 
      calcified lesion, the Agatston/Volume ratio (AVR) is an indication of the density 
      (i.e. calcium accumulation) within the plaque. RESULTS: Patients were classified as 
      high AVR (>1) or low (≤1) AVR. Survival analyses tested the association between AVR 
      and all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 5 years. The mean age was 
      57.2±13.5 years; 75% of the patients had AVR >1. The mortality rate of patients with 
      AVR >1 was significantly higher than in patients with AVR ≤1 (Hazard Ratio(HR): 
      2.46; 95% Confidence Intervals(CI): 1.16-5.21, p ≤0.018). After adjustment for 
      confounders, AVR >1 remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 
      2.24; 95% CI: 1.02-4.88, p ≤0.042). There was a significant interaction of plaque 
      density and calcium volume on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Increased plaque density is an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. These data 
      suggest that increased calcium content in the coronary arteries of patients in 
      dialysis is an index of high-risk rather than a marker of plaque stabilization.

AB  - AIM: To explore the relationship between circulating bone-specific alkaline 
      phosphatase (BALP) levels and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in patients 
      receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: A total of 156 MHD patients were 
      enrolled. Serum BALP levels were measured using ELISA, and AAC was assessed via 
      lateral abdominal radiography. RESULTS: BALP was positively correlated with AAC 
      score (r = 0.389; p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, dialysis vintage and BALP were independent risk 
      factors for AAC in MHD patients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis 
      indicated that the area under the curve of BALP for the prediction of AAC was 0.737 
      (95% CI: 0.619-0.855; p < 0.01). When the detection cut-off level was 17.55 μg/l, 
      its sensitivity was 81.7% and specificity was 74.5%. CONCLUSION: Serum BALP is 
      closely correlated with vascular calcification in MHD patients.

AB  - The increased vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has been associated with disturbances in 
      mineral-bone metabolism. In order to determine markers of the vascular calcification 
      frequently observed in these patients, blood samples of elderly male and female 
      hemodialysis CKD patients were used to measure serum levels of: osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (sRANKL), and 
      fetuin-A by enzyme immunoassay; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP-5b), and 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) by immunoenzymometric assay; osteocalcin 
      (OC) by ELISA; iPTH by immunoradiometric assay; 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), by 
      I(125) radioimmunoassay; and calcium and phosphorus by photometric assay. Serum OPG, 
      BAP, iPTH, phosphorus, and OC levels were higher and serum 25(OH)D(3), 
      1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and fetuin-A levels lower in both male and female CKD patients than 
      in their respective controls. Our results indicate that the bone formation and 
      resorption parameters are altered in elderly male and female hemodialysis CKD 
      patients. These changes may lead to vascular calcifications and cardiovascular 
      complications, given that elevated OPG and OC levels and reduced fetuin-A levels are 
      associated with cardiovascular events.

TI  - Calcium and osteoprotegerin levels predict the progression of the abdominal aortic 
      calcifications after kidney transplantation.
PG  - 42-8
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3182934cee [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are a cardiovascular risk factor in 
      patients affected by chronic kidney disease and after kidney transplantation (KTx). 
      We evaluated the prevalence of VCs at the abdominal aortic site in KTx patients at 
      the time of transplantation and 1 year after KTx, exploring the possibly associated 
      factors. METHODS: In 107 transplanted patients, the following parameters were 
      evaluated at the first and twelfth month after KTx: the aortic calcification index 
      (ACI), fibroblast growth factor 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), fetuin A, and clinical 
      and biochemical parameters. Patients were followed up for 2 years after KTx. 
      RESULTS: At the time of KTx, 60% of patients had some degree of VC (ACI>0), whereas 
      40% had no VC. One year after KTx, VCs worsened in 26% of patients, whereas in 74%, 
      VCs remained stable or improved. The progression of VC was observed almost 
      exclusively in patients with a positive ACI score at the first month. At the 
      multivariate analysis, serum calcium, OPG, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      were the only variables independently associated with the progression of VC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: VCs at the aortic site are frequent in KTx patients, and in a 
      significant percentage of them, they tend to progress even in the short time. High 
      levels of serum calcium and OPG are significantly associated with the progression of 
      VCs. Whether these associations are based on a cause-effect relationship and their 
      correction might impact on the calcification process could be ascertained by 
      prospective interventional studies.

TI  - Epicardial adipose tissue in long-term hemodialysis patients: its association with 
      vascular calcification and long-term development.
PG  - 241-250
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0221-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) in the general population. EAT is suggested to promote CAD by 
      paracrine mechanisms and local inflammation. We evaluated whether in chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients EAT associates with CAD, how the amount of EAT develops 
      over time, and if EAT independently predicts the mortality risk. METHODS: Post-hoc 
      analysis of a prospective study in 59 chronic HD patients who underwent non-enhanced 
      multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) at baseline. Thirty-seven patients underwent 
      another MSCT after 24 ± 5 months. We measured EAT volume (cm³) and Agatston 
      calcification scores of coronary arteries (CAC) and aortic valves (AVC). All-cause 
      mortality was assessed after a follow-up of 88 months (IQR 52-105). RESULTS: 
      Baseline EAT was 128.2 ± 60.8 cm³ and significantly higher than in a control group 
      of non-renal patients (94 ± 46 cm³; p < 0.05). Median Agatston score for CAC was 329 
      (IQR 23-1181) and for AVC was 0 (IQR 0-25.3) in HD patients. We observed significant 
      positive correlations between baseline EAT and age (r = 0.386; p = 0.003), BMI (r = 
      0.314; p = 0.016), CAC (r = 0.278; p = 0.03), and AVC (r = 0.282; p = 0.03). In 
      multivariate analysis, age, BMI and AVC remained as significant predictors of EAT (p 
      < 0.01). Calcification scores significantly increased over 2 years; in contrast EAT 
      change was not significant (+11 %, IQR -10 to 24 %; p = 0.066). The limited patient 
      number in the present study precludes analysis of the EAT impact upon survival. 
      CONCLUSION: EAT correlated significantly with cardiovascular calcification in 
      long-term HD patients. Mean EAT did not significantly change over 2 years.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin Is the Strongest Predictor for Progression of Arterial Calcification 
      in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1159/000477380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification (AC) is frequent in patients with end stage renal 
      disease and is also considered a risk factor for later morbidity and mortality. 
      However, long-term factors associated with the process are not well known. We 
      analyzed the trends over time of biomarkers related with development and progression 
      of AC in incident patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We performed a 
      prospective study with 186 patients on PD followed up for 1 year. We analyzed the 
      progression of AC in the abdominal aorta and pelvic vessels by calcification score 
      (CaSc), using16-cut computerized multidetector tomography at baseline and 1 year. 
      Variables related with PD treatment, inflammation, and mineral metabolism were 
      measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Changes in biochemical 
      variables were analyzed for their relationship with changes in AC. RESULTS: Over 1 
      year, the number of patients with AC increased from 47 to 56%, and CaSc from 355 
      (interquartile range [IQR] 75-792) to 529 (IQR 185-1632). A total of 43.5% of 
      patients remained free of calcification, 11.7% had new calcifications, and 44.8% had 
      progression of calcification. Older age, diabetes, high systolic blood pressure, 
      body mass index, cholesterol, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), as well as lower levels of 
      albumin, serum creatinine, and osteocalcin, were associated with development of new, 
      and rapid progression of, calcification. In multivariate logistic analysis, OPG 
      remained the most significant (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.47, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      OPG was the strongest risk factor associated with new development and rapid 
      progression of AC in incident PD patients.

TI  - Impact of circulating cathepsin K on the coronary calcification and the clinical 
      outcome in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 6-14
LID - 10.1007/s00380-014-0570-z [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a cause of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and 
      an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events 
      (MACCE). Cathepsin K (CatK) is a lysosomal cysteine protease which affects vascular 
      calcification and glucose metabolism disorder. We investigated the relationships 
      among CatK, CAC, diabetes mellitus (DM) and MACCE in CKD patients. 113 consecutive 
      CKD patients were enrolled. Their CAC was evaluated by computed tomography. Their 
      plasma CatK level was measured by ELISA. They were divided into two groups by CatK 
      levels and followed up for up to 3 years. The impact of CatK was analyzed in all 
      participants, diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
      demonstrated a significant higher incidence of MACCE in the high CatK group (P = 
      0.028). The CatK level was significantly higher in patients with MACCE compared to 
      that in patients without MACCE (P = 0.034). Cox's model revealed the higher plasma 
      CatK and BNP level as independent predictors of MACCE (P = 0.043 and P < 0.01, 
      respectively). Only in non-diabetic patients, there was a significant correlation 
      between CatK and CAC score, and high CatK group had a significant higher level of 
      LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) than low CatK 
      group. And these lipid disorders were independent predictors of CatK elevation. In 
      CKD patients, our results indicated an impact of higher CatK level on their MACCE. 
      The significant association among the CatK level, CAC and MACCE was found in 
      non-diabetic CKD patients.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification is a marker of vascular disease in prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 211-8
LID - 10.5301/JN.2011.8446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular and valvular calcifications are a common finding in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients and are associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality. We investigated the hypothesis that calcification of the cardiac valves 
      is a marker of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and thoracic aorta calcification 
      (AoC) in hemodialysis (CKD-5) patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 
      145 maintenance CKD stage 5 (CKD-5) patients. All patients underwent electron beam 
      tomography for quantification of CAC and AoC score via the Agatston score. The 
      presence of calcification of the cardiac valves was assessed by standard 
      bi-dimensional echocardiography. RESULTS: Eighty-four of the study patients (58%) 
      had echocardiographic evidence of valvular calcification. A significant and graded 
      association between valvular calcification and CAC as well as AoC was detected. 
      Patients with 1 or 2 calcified valves had a significantly greater likelihood of 
      having a CAC score >1,000 (odds ratio [OR] = 5.94; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 
      1.91-18.44; p=0.002; and OR=3.27; 95%CI, 1.36-7.88; p=0.007, respectively). 
      Similarly, the presence of 1 or 2 calcified valves was associated with an eightfold 
      and threefold increased probability of an AoC score greater than the third quartile, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional analysis shows that calcification of 
      the cardiac valves is closely associated with vascular calcification, an established 
      marker of risk in prevalent hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Soluble TWEAK and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with CKD.
PG  - 413-22
LID - 10.2215/CJN.07900715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Soluble TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) is a 
      proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily. sTWEAK concentrations 
      have been associated with the presence of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We 
      hypothesized that sTWEAK levels may relate to a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic 
      plaques, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular outcomes observed in patients 
      with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A 4-year prospective, 
      multicenter, longitudinal study was conducted in 1058 patients with CKD stages 3-5D 
      (mean age =58±13 years old; 665 men) but without any history of CVD from the NEFRONA 
      Study (a study design on the prevalence of surrogate markers of CVD). Ankle-brachial 
      index and B-mode ultrasound were performed to detect the presence of carotid and/or 
      femoral atherosclerotic plaques together with biochemical measurements and sTWEAK 
      assessment. Patients were followed for cardiovascular outcomes (follow-up of 
      3.13±1.15 years). RESULTS: Patients with more advanced CKD had lower sTWEAK levels. 
      sTWEAK concentrations were independently and negatively associated with carotid 
      intima-media thickness. sTWEAK levels were lower in patients with carotid 
      atherosclerotic plaques but not in those with femoral plaques. After adjustment by 
      confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for presenting carotid atherosclerotic plaques in 
      patients in the lowest versus highest tertile of sTWEAK was 4.18 (95% confidence 
      interval [95% CI], 2.89 to 6.08; P<0.001). Furthermore, sTWEAK levels were lower in 
      patients with calcified carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The OR for presenting 
      calcified carotid plaques was 1.77 (95% CI, 1.06 to 2.93; P=0.02) after 
      multivariable adjustment. After the follow-up, 41 fatal and 68 nonfatal 
      cardiovascular events occurred. In a Cox model, after controlling for potential 
      confounding factors, patients in the lowest tertile of sTWEAK concentrations had a 
      higher risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.40; 
      95% CI, 1.33 to 4.33; P=0.004) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.05 
      to 6.76; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Low sTWEAK levels were associated with the presence 
      of carotid atherosclerotic plaques in patients with CKD. Additionally, lower sTWEAK 
      levels were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - [Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) bone metabolism and vascular calcification 
      in hemodialyzed patients].
PG  - 703-6
AB  - Osteocalcin (OC) is witamino-K dependent calcium-binding protein comprising three 
      gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a strong bond with 
      hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone resorption 
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) appears in the blood. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the level of Glu-OC and markers of bone metabolism and their impact 
      on coronary artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure treated 
      with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients (29 women and 39 men) 
      aged 60.3 +/- 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/- 4.8 months. Control group 
      consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of age and gender. CACS was 
      evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Measurement of 
      carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and Glu-OC, bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), 
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were assessed by ELISA and iPTH by 
      Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the Gla-OC and Glu-OC in 
      hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the control group 116.37 +/- 
      70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/- 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/- 3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/- 2.63 
      ng/ ml; p <0.001. Glu-OC level correlated significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p 
      <0.001) and CaSc (p <0.014). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The results indicate a significant 
      correlation between Glu-OC and assessed markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has 
      indicated a link between bone metabolism and the degree of calcification in the 
      coronary arteries.

TI  - Surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in patients 
      with renal dysfunction and/or aortic arch calcification.
PG  - 444-447
AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors recently reported that the presence of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and/or extended abdominal aortic calcification was associated with 
      significantly worse clinical outcomes after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. CKD 
      is one of the highest risk factors for systemic atherosclerosis. Therefore, impaired 
      blood flow due to atherosclerosis could exacerbate degeneration of the cervical 
      spine and neural tissue. However, there has been no report of a study evaluating the 
      deleterious effects of CKD and atherosclerosis on the outcomes after decompression 
      surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. The purpose of this study was thus to 
      examine whether CKD and systemic atherosclerosis affect surgical outcomes after 
      laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). METHODS The authors analyzed 
      data from 127 consecutive cases involving patients who underwent laminoplasty for 
      CSM and met their inclusion criteria. Stage 3-4 CKD was present as a preoperative 
      comorbidity in 44 cases. Clinical status was assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic 
      Association (JOA) cervical myelopathy evaluation questionnaire before surgery and 2 
      years postoperatively. As a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, the presence of 
      aortic arch calcification (AoAC) was assessed on preoperative chest radiographs. 
      RESULTS AoAC was found on preoperative chest radiographs in 40 of 127 patients. 
      Neither CKD nor AoAC had a statistically significant deleterious effect on 
      preoperative JOA score. However, CKD and AoAC were significantly associated with 
      reductions in both the JOA score recovery rate (mean 36.1% in patients with CKD vs 
      44.7% in those without CKD; 26.0% in patients with AoAC vs 48.9% in those without 
      AoAC) and the change in JOA score at 2 years after surgery (mean 2.3 points in 
      patients with CKD vs 3.1 points in those without CKD; 2.1 points for patients with 
      AoAC vs 3.2 points for those without AoAC). A multivariate regression analysis 
      showed that AoAC was a significant independent predictor of poor outcome with 
      respect to both for the difference between follow-up and preoperative JOA scores and 
      the JOA score recovery rate. CONCLUSIONS CKD and AoAC were associated with increased 
      rates of poor neurological outcomes after laminoplasty for CSM, and AoAC was a 
      significant independent predictive factor for poor outcome.

TI  - Vascular stiffness in incident peritoneal dialysis patients over time.
PG  - 254-62
LID - 10.5414/CN107398 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular stiffness is prevalent in end-stage renal disease patients and 
      predicts adverse events. This study describes the prevalence of vascular stiffness 
      and its associated factors in a cohort of incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. METHODS: In a prospective observational study of 50 patients, 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) were conducted at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 
      months after initiation of PD. Aortic calcification scores (ACS) were derived using 
      plain lateral abdominal films. We examined the association of significant changes in 
      PWV (defined as 1 m/s or 15% change from baseline) over 6 months in conjunction with 
      demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: The mean age was 58 years, 67% were male, 
      and 48% were Caucasian. One third was diabetic, and 23% had pre-existing 
      cardiovascular disease. Median eGFR was 8.7 ml/ min. ACS was strongly correlated 
      with PWV (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001). Over 6 months, 42% demonstrated significant 
      increases, while 23% demonstrated decreases in their PWV. Factors shown to be 
      associated with increasing PWV were Caucasian race (OR = 4.50; CI: 0.97 - 20.83), 
      higher phosphate (OR = 8.36; CI: 1.10 - 63.51) and a lower baseline PWV (OR = 0.67; 
      CI: 0.45 - 0.99). Decrease in PWV was associated with the absence of calcium based 
      phosphate binder usage (OR = 0.11; CI: 0.02 - 0.73). Changes in weight and PWV at 12 
      months were significantly correlated (p = 0.007, r = 0.57). CONCLUSION: In this 
      group of incident PD patients, we demonstrate a lower prevalence of vascular 
      calcification than in hemodialysis patients, a correlation of calcification with 
      PWV, and an important finding that PWV can change in either direction over a short 
      period of time, which are associated with modifiable risk factors.

PG  - 24-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are one of the main causes of morbidity and 
      mortality in dialysis patients. High incidence of cardiovascular diseases in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can not soley be explained by traditional 
      risk factors. Several studies have confirmed association between vascular 
      calcification and increased mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 
      total of 44 patients on chronic hemodialysis program, 18 women and 26 men, with 
      average age of 50.66 +/- 11.62 years and average duration of treatment of 
      100.25=52.83 months. We analyzed socio-demographic parameters and standard 
      laboratory findings. X-ray of hand and pelvis was obtained from each patient along 
      with echocardiography and carotid ultrasound imaging. To estimate the level of 
      vascular calcifications on the X-rays, we used the simple vascular score (sVC). 
      RESULTS: Using noninvasive methods, we found vascular calcifications in 26 (59%) 
      patients. In 22 (45%) patients, vascular calcifications were found in X-rays. Four 
      (9%) patients with vascular calcifications lacked any abnormality on X-rays but had 
      calcified plaques on carotid arteries or hart valves. In the group of patients that 
      had vascular calcifications, 3 (14%) patients had sVC score of 2,2 (9%) had score of 
      3,7 (32%) had score of 4,4 (18%) had score of 6, and 6 (27%) had sVC score of 8. 
      Comparing the group of patients with and without vascular calcifications, we found 
      statistically significant age difference (p<0.05) as well as difference in the 
      duration of hemodialysis (p<0.05). There were no other significant differences found 
      between the two groups. There is a statistically significant correlation between sVC 
      score and level of calcium (p<0.09) and iPTH (p<0.05). Using regression model for 
      increase of sVC score, we found significant correlation with duration of 
      hemodialysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Existence of vascular calcifications represents 
      warning sign of increased cardiovascular risk. Simple vascular score is an easy 
      method for assessing that risk. In our study, increased frequency of vascular 
      calcifications was directly correlated with older age and length of hemodialysis. 
      Standard X-rays, echocardiography and ultrasound imaging can be used in screening of 
      vascular calcifications. Among these methods, X-ray has advantage because it is 
      widely available and easy to interpret.

TI  - Total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are associated with bone mineral 
      density over time in end-stage renal disease patients starting dialysis.
PG  - 255-262
LID - 10.1007/s40620-016-0292-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP (BALP) are implicated 
      in the abnormal skeletal mineralization and accelerated vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Whereas ALP and BALP may predict mortality in 
      CKD, BALP is reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity than total ALP in 
      reflecting histological alterations in bone; however, results on their associations 
      with bone mineral density (BMD) are inconsistent. Here we evaluated associations of 
      total ALP and BALP with BMD during up to 24 months in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 194 ESRD patients (median age 
      57 years, 66 % male, 32 % diabetes mellitus, mean body mass index 24.8 kg/m(2)) 
      underwent measurements of total ALP and BALP and total and regional body BMD (by 
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) at dialysis initiation (n = 194), and after 12 
      (n = 98) and 24 months (n = 40) on dialysis. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had 
      median total ALP 65.4 (43.3-126.4) U/l, BALP 13.5 (7.1-27.3) µg/l and BMD 1.14 
      (0.97-1.31) g/cm(2). During the study period, serum concentrations of ALP and BALP 
      increased significantly (p < 0.001), whereas total and regional BMD remained stable. 
      BMD correlated inversely with total ALP (rho = -0.20, p = 0.005) and BALP 
      (rho = -0.30, p < 0.001) at baseline, and correlations were similar also at 12 and 
      24 months. CONCLUSION: ALP and BALP are equally accurate albeit weak predictors of 
      BMD in ESRD patients, both at baseline and longitudinally. The dissociation between 
      stable BMD and increasing ALP and BALP may possibly reflect increased soft tissue 
      calcifications with time on dialysis.

      (CKD): relationship with bone density and arterial stiffness.
PG  - 473-80
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9595-4 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. The 
      Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in 
      CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible association of circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signaling 
      inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in predialysis CKD. 
      Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B 
      (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were 
      analyzed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip 
      (TH), and forearm (FARM). Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour 
      analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between 
      sclerostin and age (r = 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p 
      = 0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association 
      between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between 
      sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In 
      contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative 
      association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the 
      Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to 
      establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in 
      CKD.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in CKD-5D  patients is tied to adverse cardiac 
      function  and increased mortality .
PG  - 291-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) and is an important predictor of mortality. 
      However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not been well 
      established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases mortality by 
      adversely affecting cardiac function. METHODS: Patients were recruited from 37 
      regional dialysis centers. 2-D and Doppler echocardiographic analyses were 
      performed, and CAC was measured using 64-slice computed tomography. Relationships 
      between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function were 
      analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: There 
      were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median age was 55 years, 
      and median duration of CKD-5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC scores 100 were found in 
      69% of patients, with 51% having a score  400. CAC was associated with measures of 
      LV systolic and diastolic function (global longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, 
      p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity (rho = -0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV 
      filling pressure (E:E'; rho = 0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed 
      these relationships after adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and 
      coronary artery disease. Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). 
      Both LV diastolic and systolic functional measures were significant predictors of 
      mortality, the strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings show a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD-5D. LV 
      diastolic function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent 
      predictors of mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in 
      CKD-5D. These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with 
      CKD-5D and describe a potentially-valuable role for echocardiography in the routine 
      management of these patients. .

      patients.
PG  - 257-63
LID - 10.1159/000157629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular 
      events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement of 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the incidence of 
      cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients. METHODS: We conducted a 
      prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with morbidity and 
      mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 and May 2006. 
      RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 34 female) were 
      prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this period, 27 patients 
      developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related to cardiovascular 
      disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the high OPG group 
      showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with 
      the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis associated the new onset of 
      cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 
      0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start of HD was significantly 
      associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic calcification index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients may predict subsequent 
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Calcimimetic and vitamin D analog use in hemodialyzed patients is associated with 
      increased levels of vitamin K dependent proteins.
PG  - 333-41
LID - 10.1007/s12020-015-0673-z [doi]
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) are two vitamin K-dependent 
      proteins (VKDPs) involved in the regulation of vascular calcification (VC). We 
      carried out a secondary analysis of the VIKI study to evaluate associations between 
      drug consumption and VKDP levels in 387 hemodialyzed patients. The VIKI study 
      assessed the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in hemodialysis patients. We 
      evaluated drug consumption, determined BGP and MGP levels, and verified the presence 
      of any vertebral fractures (VF) and VC by spine radiographs. Total BGP levels were 
      twice as high with calcimimetics versus no calcimimetics (290 vs. 158.5 mcg/L, p < 
      0.0001) and 69 % higher with vitamin D analogs (268 vs. 159 mcg/L, p < 0.0001). 
      Total MGP was 19 % higher with calcimimetics (21.5 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.04) and 54 
      % higher with calcium acetate (27.9 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.003); no difference was 
      found with vitamin D analogs (21.1 vs. 18.3 mcg/L, p = 0.43). Median Total BGP level 
      was 29 % lower in patients with ≥1 VF (151 vs. 213 mcg/L, p = 0.0091) and 36 % lower 
      in patients with VC (164 vs. 262.1 mcg/L, p = 0.0003). In non-survivors, median BGP 
      and MGP were lower, but only for MGP this difference reached the statistical 
      significance (152 vs. 191 mcg/L, p = 0.20 and 15.0 vs. 19.7 mcg/L, p = 0.02, 
      respectively). Pending studies on vitamin K supplementation, calcimimetics, and 
      vitamin D analogs may play a role in preserving vitamin K-dependent protein 
      activity, thus contributing to bone and vascular health in CKD patients.

TI  - Vascular Calcification Progression Is an Independent Predictor of Mortality in 
      Patients on Haemodialysis.
PG  - 169-74
LID - 10.1159/000431288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that vascular calcification (VC) score was 
      associated with mortality in patients on haemodialysis (HD) and that a high serum 
      level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 were the 
      only factors associated with VC progression. AIM: To assess the impact of VC 
      progression on HD patient survival. METHODS: The study cohort including 85 HD 
      patients studied between 2006 and 2007 and between 2009 and 2010 was divided into 
      patients with VC progression (PG+, n = 38) and no-progression (PG-, n = 47), based 
      on VC scores measured twice at 3-year intervals (VC1 and VC2). Patients were 
      followed during 3 additional years. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis determined that 
      PG+ displayed increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 1.12-4.8; p = 0.03). This result was confirmed using a Cox proportional 
      hazards model adjusted for age, dialysis duration, the VC1 score, and the mean 
      FGF-23 and iPTH serum levels (HR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.12-6.6; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: VC 
      progression is associated with poor survival in patients on HD, irrespective of a 
      patient's baseline VC score.

TI  - Association of interleukin-6 with aortic stiffness in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 5-13

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aortic stiffness, a nontraditional risk factor, is 
      associated with high rate of mortality in CKD. Using a CKD animal model with medial 
      vascular calcification, we previously reported increased mRNA expression of 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in 
      calcified aorta. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between 
      IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, and aortic stiffness in end-stage renal disease patients. In a 
      cross-sectional study, we enrolled 351 patients on dialysis. Aortic stiffness was 
      assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), while central pulse 
      pressure and augmentation index were assessed using generalized transfer function 
      applied to the radial artery pressure wave form. Plasma IL-6, TNF, and IL-1β were 
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 was associated with cf-PWV 
      adjusted for mean blood pressure (MBP) (standardized β = 0.270; P < .001). In a 
      multivariate adjusted model for age, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and MBP, IL-6 was 
      still associated with cf-PWV (standardized β = 0.096; P = .026). The impact of age, 
      diabetes, and CVD on cf-PWV was partially mediated by IL-6 in a mediation analysis. 
      However, there were no associations between TNF, IL-1β, and aortic stiffness. While 
      IL-6 was associated with augmentation index (standardized β = 0.224; P < .001) and 
      central pulse pressure (standardized β = 0.162; P = .001) when adjusted for MBP and 
      heart rate, this relationship was not significant after adjusting for potential 
      confounders.This study suggests a potential role of IL-6 for CKD-related aortic 
      stiffness.

AB  - Exhaustion of vascular accesses is a major complication in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis, especially in pediatric setting. We report the case of a boy treated 
      for loss of hemodialysis access after a combined liver-kidney transplantation and 
      transient renal dysfunction. An interventional dilatation of calcific superior vena 
      cava allowed to insert a stable central venous line for dialysis until full graft 
      recovery. Careful management of central lines allows to spare the main vessels and 
      reduces the need for unusual accesses.

TI  - Survival following parathyroidectomy among United States dialysis patients.
PG  - 2010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among persons 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone disease, 
      vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can 
      dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the 
      relationship between PTX and survival is not known. METHODS: We conducted an 
      observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United States Renal 
      Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first PTX while on 
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, 
      cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis 
      modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed 
      from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The 30-day 
      postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. Long-term relative risks of 
      death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those 
      of matched control patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 
      groups crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 
      51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, 
      mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to 
      attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients with 
      end-stage renal disease.

      disease: a computed tomographic study.
PG  - 501-8
LID - 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283639eb3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, 
      atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 
      non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic 
      angiography. METHODS: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary 
      atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD 
      patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD controls 
      (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging 
      software. RESULTS: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques 
      (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium 
      content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score 
      correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non-ESRD, P<0.001 
      for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and 
      atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 
      vs. 0.804; P=0.574). CONCLUSION: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and 
      calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score 
      and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD.

TI  - Systemic Inflammation Is Associated With Coronary Artery Calcification and All-Cause 
      Mortality in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1644-52
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-15-1224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of systemic inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      associated with advanced coronary artery calcification (CAC). The prognostic 
      significance of this association, however, is unknown. We evaluated the associations 
      between CAC, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and all-cause mortality, to 
      determine whether the associations differ according to the presence of systemic 
      inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 30,703 consecutive individuals who 
      underwent CAC measurement for a median of 79 months (IQR, 65-96 months). Patients 
      were categorized according to baseline CAC score (0, 1-99, 100-399 and ≥400), eGFR 
      (<45, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, 90-104, and ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP; <2.0, and ≥2.0 mg/L). Prevalence and extent of CAC were 
      greater in those with lower eGFR and higher hsCRP accordingly, even after 
      adjustment. Lower eGFR was strongly associated with higher CAC score (≥400), and the 
      association was more significant in patients with higher hsCRP. The greater CAC 
      burden was associated with worse outcome in the CKD patients (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2)) only in those with higher hsCRP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low eGFR and more 
      extensive CAC had greater risk of mortality, and associations differed according to 
      the presence of systemic inflammation. Among the CKD patients, coronary evaluation 
      may be considered for those with elevated hsCRP. (Circ J 2016; 80: 1644-1652).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypomagnesaemia is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in the general 
      population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      pre-dialysis magnesium (Mg) and CV risk markers, [including pulse pressure (PP), 
      left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and vascular calcifications (VC)], and mortality 
      in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a 48-month prospective study 
      in 206 patients under pre-dilution haemodiafiltration with a dialysate Mg 
      concentration of 1 mmol/l. RESULTS: Lower Mg concentrations were predictors of an 
      increased PP (≥65 mm Hg) (p = 0.002) and LVMI (≥140 g/m(2)) (p = 0.03) and of a 
      higher VC score (≥3) (p = 0.01). Patients with Mg <1.15 mmol/l had a lower survival 
      at the end of the study (p = 0.01). Serum Mg <1.15 mmol/l was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause (p = 0.01) and CV mortality (p = 0.02) when adjusted for 
      multiple CV risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Lower Mg levels seem to be associated with 
      increased CV risk markers, like PP, LVMI and VC, and with higher mortality in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score can predict future coronary artery disease in 
      hemodialysis patients: a 5-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 313

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has been known to be associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis. However, the association between AAC 
      and future coronary artery disease (CAD) occurrence is not clear. We aimed to 
      clarify the association of AAC severity and the occurrence of future CAD events in 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Hemodialysis (HD) patients were recruited in this 
      prospective cohort study. AAC severity was quantified by AAC score, which was 
      measured by lateral lumbar radiography. We used receiver operation curve (ROC) 
      analysis to find the cutoff AAC value for CAD prediction. CAD-free survival was 
      analyzed by Kaplan-Meier study. RESULTS: There were 303 patients recruited for study 
      with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 95 (65-146) months. The AAC score 
      in patients with occurrence of new CAD [9 (3-15.25), n = 114] was higher than in 
      patients without new CAD occurrence [5 (1-9) n = 189], p < 0.001. Multivariate 
      hazard ratio of AAC score for CAD was 1.039 (p = 0.016). ROC study showed that an 
      AAC score of 5.5 had a sensitivity of 0.658 and a specificity of 0.587 in the 
      prediction of new CAD occurrence. Patients with AAC score above 5.5 had 
      significantly higher cumulative incidence of CAD than patients with AAC score below 
      5.5. Age, diabetes, prior history of CAD, and longer dialysis vintage were major 
      factors associated with higher AAC score. CONCLUSIONS: AAC score can predict the 
      occurrence of future CAD events in HD patients. The best cut-off value of AAC score 
      is 5.5. AAC score greater than 5.5 is a reliable abdominal aortic calcification 
      marker, and can predict future CAD in ESRD patients. Major contributive factors for 
      higher AAC score were age, presence of diabetes, prior history of CAD, and longer 
      dialysis vintage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis 
      patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of 
      these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy 
      studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we 
      hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be 
      predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. METHODS: All 
      patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI 
      with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent 
      CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified 
      using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC 
      and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients 
      were included in this study (71% male, 67 ± 7 years old). Forty-six patients were 
      found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with 
      CAD (10.1 ± 4.9 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed 
      that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold 
      higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% 
      and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is 
      predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic 
      dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could 
      contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of 
      CAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ; ISRCTN20479861 , registered

TI  - Deterioration of Cerebral Oxygenation by Aortic Arch Calcification Progression in

PG  - 2852514
LID - 10.1155/2017/2852514 [doi]
LID - 2852514
AB  - BACKGROUND: Near-infrared spectroscopy revealed that the regional saturation of 
      oxygen (rSO(2)) in cerebral tissue is lower in hemodialysis (HD) patients than in 
      healthy subjects. However, no study has examined the changes in cerebral oxygenation 
      by aortic arch calcification (AAC) progression in HD patients. METHODS: A total of 
      104 HD patients were divided into four groups by AAC grade determined using chest 
      radiography: 23 patients at grade 0, 24 at grade 1, 30 at grade 2, and 27 at grade 
      3. Differences in clinical parameters, including cerebral rSO(2), among AAC grades 
      were investigated and atherosclerotic parameters affecting cerebral rSO(2) values 
      were identified. RESULTS: Cerebral rSO(2) significantly decreased as AAC progressed 
      (AAC grade 3 versus grade 0, p < 0.01 versus grade 1, p < 0.05). Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis was performed using parameters with p values < 0.20 in 
      univariate analysis between cerebral rSO(2) values less than the mean and 
      atherosclerotic parameters. AAC grades 2 and 3, serum phosphate level, and history 
      of smoking were factors associated with the cerebral rSO(2) decrease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cerebral rSO(2) significantly decreased as AAC progressed and was independently 
      associated with higher AAC grade, serum phosphate level, and history of smoking.

TI  - Severe hypovitaminosis D in chronic kidney disease: association with blood pressure 
      and coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 428-32
LID - 10.1038/hr.2012.230 [doi]
AB  - Hypovitaminosis D occurs early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 
      its association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well known. In this 
      study, we aimed to evaluate whether the degree of hypovitaminosis D may differently 
      affect blood pressure (BP) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in nondialyzed 
      CKD patients. This study included 80 CKD patients with a creatinine clearance 
      between 15 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and serum 25 hydroxivitamin D [25(OH)D] level 
      <30 ng/ml. Patients underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, evaluation of CAC 
      (multi-slice computed tomography), and laboratory evaluation. Two groups, based on 
      the degree of hypovitaminosis D, were defined according to the median 25(OH)D value. 
      Patients with severe hypovitaminosis D [25(OH)D <17.2 ng/ml; S-group) exhibited a 
      higher systolic BP at all time periods (24-h, nighttime, daytime) when compared to 
      patients with mild hypovitaminosis D [25(OH)D >17.2 ng/ml; M-group]. No differences 
      were found between the S and M-group in terms of diastolic BP and the presence of 
      coronary calcification. In the multiple linear regression analysis, severe 
      hypovitaminosis D was a predictor of 24-h, daytime and nighttime BP after 
      controlling for a number of confounders. The severity of hypovitaminosis D was 
      associated with increased BP in nondialyzed CKD patients. The degree of 
      hypovitaminosis D was not related to CAC, which was equally elevated in both the 
      severe and mild hypovitaminosis D groups.

TI  - A Nationally Representative Study of Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy Risk Factors.
PG  - 3421-3429
AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is 
      necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated 
      whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would identify patients 
      at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using data from a large 
      dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) 
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race 
      in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients 
      and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively; 67% of participants were women and 
      49% were white. Median duration between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA 
      development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; 
      higher levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and 
      nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with 
      increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes 
      receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a 
      dose-response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh 
      areas (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for more 
      than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between 
      recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years 
      before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of preventive 
      strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Application of a Novel CT-Based Iliac Artery Calcification Scoring System for 
      Predicting Renal Transplant Outcomes.
PG  - 436-41
LID - 10.2214/AJR.15.14794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and 
      distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium 
      scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT of 
      the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56 women 
      with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate semiquantitative 
      score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and morphology for the 
      common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The operative and 
      clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial segment was used for 
      anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether delayed graft function 
      (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using 
      the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for 
      each calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly 
      higher average calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all 
      categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of 
      higher scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, 
      hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the 
      calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was 
      independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of 
      the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT 
      evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival after 
      transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis 
      was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine 
      pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with 
      diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to 
      optimize outcomes.

TI  - Higher serum sclerostin levels and insufficiency of vitamin D are strongly 
      associated with vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients: a case control study.
PG  - 577-584
LID - 10.1007/s00198-016-3770-9 [doi]
AB  - In hemodialysis patients, vertebral fractures were associated with elevated 
      sclerostin levels, suggesting that sclerostin could reflect bone fragility in these 
      patients. INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are common in hemodialysis patients. The 
      aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of vertebral fracture and analyze 
      associations between sclerostin serum levels and vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: Ninety-two hemodialysis patients and 100 controls matched for age 
      and sex were studied. Bone mineral density was measured by ultrasonography at 
      non-dominant heel. The markers of bone turnover included serum osteocalcin, 
      C-terminal telopeptide, and sclerostin. All participants underwent radiography of 
      the thoracic and lumbar spine to ascertain the presence of vertebral fractures. 
      RESULTS: Bone ultrasound parameters at calcaneus were significantly lower in 
      hemodialysis patients compared with controls; bone turnover markers and parathyroid 
      hormone level were significantly higher, while serum of 25-OH-D3 was significantly 
      lower in hemodialysis group. One or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures were 
      found in 38 hemodialysis patients, whereas in control group, 10 patients had a 
      vertebral fracture. In hemodialysis group, the comparison between patients with and 
      without vertebral fractures showed that the patients with vertebral fractures had 
      the serum sclerostin levels statistically higher than patients without vertebral, 
      while serum levels of 25-OH-D3 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral 
      fractures compared to the patients without vertebral fractures. Multivariate 
      analysis disclosed that sclerostin levels were associated with an increased risk of 
      vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients after adjusting for multiple variables. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows high prevalence of vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients and that it is associated with elevated sclerostin levels, reflecting bone 
      fragility in these patients.

AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called 
      novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to 
      identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by 
      MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, 
      presence of ≥100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate, geriatric 
      nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3, cinacalcet, phosphate 
      binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation parameters including creatinine, 
      albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 MHD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcifications were observed in 192 patients (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS 
      showed direct associations with age (p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and 
      presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), and an inverse association only with 
      active vitamin D3 administration (p < 0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active 
      vitamin D3 showed significantly lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 ± 1635.0 
      vs. 2475.6 ± 2646.6 H, p < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and 
      diabetes mellitus are risk factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is 
      protective factor for coronary artery calcification in MHD patients.

TI  - Associations between Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE) 
      and S100A12 (EN-RAGE) with Mortality in Long-term Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 54-59
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2017.32.1.54 [doi]
AB  - Hemodialysis (HD) patients experience vascular calcification, ultimately leading to 
      high mortality rates. Previously, we reported associations between soluble receptor 
      for advanced glycation end products (sRAGEs) and extracellular newly identified 
      RAGE-binding protein S100A12 (EN-RAGE) and vascular calcification. Here, we extended 
      our observations, investigating whether these biomarkers may be useful for 
      predicting cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these subjects. Thus, we 
      evaluated the relationship between sRAGE and S100A12 and mortality in long-term HD 
      patients. This was a prospective observational cohort study in 199 HD patients from 
      an extended analysis of our previous study. Plasma sRAGE, S100A12, comorbidities, 
      and other traditional risk factors were investigated. The cumulative incidences for 
      death using Cox proportional hazards regression were evaluated in multivariable 
      analyses. The observation period was 44 months. During the observation period, 27 
      (13.6%) patients died. Univariate analysis demonstrated that S100A12 was correlated 
      with diabetes (P = 0.040) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (P = 
      0.006). In multivariable analyses, plasma sRAGE (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.155; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.612-2.183; P = 0.656) and S100A12 (HR = 0.960; 95% CI = 
      0.566-1.630; P = 0.881) were not associated with mortality in HD patients, although 
      traditional predictors of mortality, including age, history of cardiovascular 
      diseases (CVDs), and serum levels of albumin and hsCRP were related to mortality. 
      Powerful predictors of mortality were age, CVD, and albumin levels. Plasma sRAGE and 
      S100A12 may be weak surrogate markers for predicting all-cause mortality in patients 
      undergoing HD, although S100A12 was partly related to diabetes and inflammation.

TI  - Cinacalcet reduces vascular and soft tissue calcification in secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease 
      patients on hemodialysis (HD) can be challenging. Conventional treatments can lead 
      to hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, both of which are associated with vascular 
      and soft tissue calcification and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We 
      report the effect of treatment with the Type II calcimimetic cinacalcet on vascular 
      calcification in a HD patient with SHPT. A 40-year-old male with a 24-year history 
      of kidney failure secondary to mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, commenced 
      HD in October 2004 following chronic graft dysfunction. The patient was admitted to 
      hospital with renal insufficiency and metabolic abnormalities. An 
      anatomopathological study showed calcium (Ca) deposits in the alveolar septa, 
      bronchial wall and pulmonary arterioles. Parathyroid methoxy isobutyl isonitrile 
      (MIBI) scintigraphy revealed multiglandular parathyroid disease and an ectopic gland 
      behind the sternal notch. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was repeatedly 
      found to be > or = 2,500 pg/ml, and was accompanied by significant abnormalities in 
      phosphorus (P) and Ca metabolism which were difficult to control. The patient was 
      initially treated with sevelamer, low dose calcium carbonate, a low P and reduced 
      protein diet and high doses of intravenous erythropoietin. In addition, he received 
      HD with a high efficiency membrane for 4.5 hours, 4-times weekly. Treatment with 
      cinacalcet was initiated at 30 mg/day and adjusted to achieve National Kidney 
      Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative targets for iPTH, P, Ca and 
      Ca-P product. One year following cinacalcet treatment, a chest x-ray showed a 
      moderate reduction in Ca deposits, a bone X-ray showed a significant reduction in 
      vascular calcifications, and parathyroid MIBI scintigraphy showed a disappearance of 
      ectopic focus and minimal remains of glands. Significant reductions in calcemia were 
      controlled by concomitant modifications to oral Ca supplementation, Ca concentration 
      in the dialysis liquid, and administration of paricalcitriol. In the second year of 
      treatment, iPTH was maintained within the target range, with moderate rises in P and 
      stabilization of serum Ca. An echocardiogram showed an improvement in left 
      ventricular hypertrophy. Chest and hand X-rays showed a progressive reduction in 
      calcifications. Radiology showed an improvement in bone morphology, with reduced 
      trabeculation and better cortical definition in the phalanx bones. In conclusion, 
      the changes in iPTH, P and Ca associated with cinacalcet treatment were accompanied 
      by reduced vascular and soft tissue calcification in this patient. There were no 
      cardiovascular events and the patient experienced a marked improvement in quality of 
      life.

TI  - Higher mineralized bone volume is associated with a lower plain X-Ray vascular 
      calcification score in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - e0179868

LID - e0179868
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In dialysis patients, there is an increasing evidence 
      that altered bone metabolism is associated with cardiovascular calcifications. The 
      main objective of this study was to analyse, in hemodialysis patients, the 
      relationships between bone turnover, mineralization and volume, evaluated in bone 
      biopsies, with a plain X-ray vascular calcification score. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In a cross-sectional study, bone biopsies and 
      evaluation of vascular calcifications were performed in fifty hemodialysis patients. 
      Cancellous bone volume, mineralized bone volume, osteoid volume, activation 
      frequency, bone formation rate/bone surface, osteoid thickness and mineralization 
      lag time were determined by histomorphometry. Vascular calcifications were assessed 
      by the simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) in plain X-Ray of pelvis and hands 
      and, for comparison, by the Agatston score in Multi-Slice Computed Tomography 
      (MSCT). RESULTS: SVCS≥3 was present in 20 patients (40%). Low and high bone turnover 
      were present in 54% and 38% of patients, respectively. Low bone volume was present 
      in 20% of patients. In multivariable analysis, higher age (p = 0.015) and longer 
      hemodialysis duration (p = 0.017) were associated with SVCS≥3. Contrary to 
      cancellous bone volume, the addition to this model of mineralized bone volume (OR = 
      0.863; 95%CI: 0.766, 0.971; p = 0.015), improved the performance of the model. For 
      each increase of 1% in mineralized bone volume there was a 13.7% decrease in the 
      odds of having SVCS≥3 (p = 0.015). An Agatston score>400 was observed in 80% of the 
      patients with a SVCS≥3 versus 4% of patients with a SVCS<3, (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Higher mineralized bone volume was associated with a lower plain X-ray vascular 
      calcification. This study corroborates the hypothesis of the existence of a link 
      between bone and vessel and reinforces the clinical utility of this simple and 
      inexpensive vascular calcification score in dialysis patients.

TI  - Is Kauppila method able to detect the progression of vascular calcification and 
      predict cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis?
PG  - 84-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. Vascular calcification (VC) is common in these patients. The main 
      objective of this study was to evaluate if a semiquantitative radiographic method is 
      able to detect VC progression in a prospective cohort of patients and predict the 
      risk of cardiovascular events. Secondarily, we intend to identify predictors of the 
      presence and progression of VC. METHODS: 49 patients undergoing HD for ≥ 90 days 
      were included. At the beginning and after 12 months, the VC score (VCS) was 
      determined by the Kauppila method, and clinical, nutritional, and laboratory markers 
      were measured. The rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events were analyzed 
      from months 13 to 24. RESULTS: Of 49 patients, 55.1% were male, 46.9% diabetic, and 
      the mean age was 59.5 ± 14.4 years. At the beginning of the follow-up, 65.3% of the 
      patients exhibited VC with a median VCS of 4 points. The intracellular water was 
      negatively associated with VC and its intensity. The presence of VC was the only 
      independent predictor of VC progression. Among patients with VC, 17 showed rapid 
      progression, and 15 showed slow progression. The VCS was independently associated 
      with rapid progression, while ΔCS (final VCS - initial VCS) was an independent 
      predictor of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: The Kauppila method was able to 
      detect VC, its progression, and predict cardiovascular events. These results suggest 
      an association of VC with nutritional status.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder enhances coronary artery 
      impairment (often occult and difficult to diagnose) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      The aim of the study was to correlate biochemical and imagistic parameters of MBD 
      with the degree of documented coronary artery disease (CAD) in non-diabetic HD 
      patients, in order to obtain a MBD-coronary risk score as a screening algorithm. 
      METHODS: A 3-year prospective study was conducted on 168 non-diabetic HD patients, 
      evaluating MBD biochemical parameters along with pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
      determination and valve/coronary calcification assessment; coronary angiography was 
      performed in symptomatic patients. Correlations between noninvasive parameters and 
      the degree of coronary obstruction were assessed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 
      software, Chi-square test and the determination of odds ratio. RESULTS: Significant 
      differences in serum calcium (p < 0.001), phosphates (p = 0.03), bicarbonate 
      (p < 0.001), albumin and iPTH (p = 0.002), percentage of deviations from PWV normal 
      values (p = 0.004), average doses of phosphate binders and vitamin D and the number 
      of vascular/valve calcifications were noted between the study group (angina, n = 17) 
      and control group (asymptomatic, n = 151). After applying MBD-coronary risk score in 
      control group, coronary angiography was performed in high-score patients. 
      CONCLUSION: A noninvasive screening algorithm for early diagnosis of CAD in 
      asymptomatic HD patients with altered MBD parameters is necessary. Applying 
      MBD-coronary risk score might be an important step in the prevention of major 
      coronary episodes by extending the indication for further investigations, early 
      diagnosis and treatment management.

AB  - Calcification of coronary vessels progresses rapidly in hemodialysis (HD) patients 
      and comprises a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. The aim of this 
      prospective study was to evaluate the coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 
      patients with end stage renal disease undergoing regular HD and to determine the 
      effect of renal transplantation (RT) in the progression of CAC, using the Agatston 
      technique for calcium scoring. The study included 20 patients with end-stage renal 
      disease undergoing a regular HD treatment (16 males, 4 females) 54.1 ± 9.5 years old 
      who had just received a renal transplant and 16 more HD patients (11 males, 5 
      females) 54.4 ± 13.8 years old as control group. The baseline evaluation showed a 
      very high prevalence of CAC in both groups, which was positively correlated with age 
      (p < 0.001) and CRP (p = 0.03). The second (follow-up) evaluation showed a 
      significant slower progression of calcification after RT. In both groups, high 
      calcium score values in the follow-up evaluation had a strong positive correlation 
      with baseline calcium score (p < 0.001).

TI  - Vascular calcifications, arterial aging and arterial remodeling in ESRD.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1159/000345172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated arterial aging and inadequate outward arterial remodeling 
      are observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Whether these changes could 
      be closely associated with arterial calcifications has never been investigated. 
      METHODS: 155 ESRD patients and 105 age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched control 
      subjects were included. Common carotid artery (CCA) pressure, diameter, intima-media 
      thickness, elastic modulus, and presence of calcified plaques were measured 
      ultrasonographically. Carotid artery stiffness was determined from simultaneously 
      recorded CCA diameter and stroke changes in diameter and CCA pressure waveforms, 
      obtained by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, ESRD 
      patients had increased CCA systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.001), larger CCA 
      diameter (p < 0.001) and CCA intima-media thickness (p < 0.01) and similar CCA 
      relative wall thickness. In ESRD patients the arterial remodeling was associated 
      with increased CCA elastic modulus/stiffness (p < 0.001). In ESRD patients the 
      association between CCA elastic modulus and age was characterized by a steeper slope 
      (p = 0.03), but after separation of uremic patients according to the presence of 
      calcifications, the accelerated aging was observed only in calcified subjects. 
      Despite higher CCA systolic and pulse pressures, the CCA relative wall thickness was 
      similar to controls indicating an inadequate pressure-associated remodeling. 
      Moreover, the positive systolic pressure/relative thickness correlation observed in 
      control subjects was lost with paradoxical negative correlation in calcified ESRD 
      patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in ESRD patients, 
      accelerated arterial aging and inadequate arterial hypertrophy are closely 
      associated with the calcifications of arterial walls. Inadequate hypertrophy is 
      responsible for high circumferential stress applied on the vessels.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease, plasma lipoproteins, and coronary artery calcium incidence: 
      the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 652-8
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300624 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of chronic kidney disease and coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC) incidence, and the distribution of lipoproteins across 
      categories of kidney function and their association with CAC risk. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We analyzed data from 2795 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis with no CAC (calcium score=0) at baseline enrolled at the first 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis visit between the years 2000 and 2002. During 
      a median follow-up of 2.4 years, incident calcium (calcium score>0 at follow-up) 
      developed in 12%, 19%, and 27% of participants with a cystatin-c estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (mL/min per 1.73 m)(2) of ≥90, 60 to 89, and 30 to 59 (P 
      for difference <0.001), respectively. Compared with those with normal kidney 
      function (estimated glomerular filtration rate≥90), adjusted CAC incidence risk 
      ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: 1.26 (95% CI, 
      1.04-1.52), and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.11-2.20; P(trend)=0.014) in those with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 60 to 89 and 30 to 59, respectively. These 
      associations were attenuated after adjusting for a characteristic and strongly 
      interrelated lipid phenotype (principal component 1), which was more common in those 
      with chronic kidney disease and characterized by a predominance of triglyceride-rich 
      lipoproteins: CAC incidence risk ratios=1.21 (95% CI, 1.00-1.46) and 1.44 (95% CI, 
      1.02-2.04; P(trend)=0.06) in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 to 
      89 and 30 to 59, respectively, after adjusting for principal component 1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with CAC incidence. Part 
      of this association is mediated through a characteristic lipid phenotype comprising 
      elevations in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

TI  - Arterial microcalcification in atherosclerotic patients with and without chronic 
      kidney disease: a comparative high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction analysis.
PG  - 465-72
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9594-5 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, albeit heterogeneous in terms of biological and 
      physicochemical properties, has been associated with ageing, lifestyle, diabetes, 
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unknown whether or not moderately impaired 
      renal function (CKD stages 2-4) affects the physiochemical composition and/or the 
      formation of magnesium-containing tricalcium phosphate ([Ca,Mg](3)[PO(4)](2), 
      whitlockite) in arterial microcalcification. Therefore, a high-resolution scanning 
      X-ray diffraction analysis (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, 
      France) utilizing histological sections of paraffin-embedded arterial specimens 
      derived from atherosclerotic patients with normal renal function (n = 15) and CKD 
      (stages 2-4, n = 13) was performed. This approach allowed us to spatially assess the 
      contribution of calcium phosphate (apatite) and whitlockite to arterial 
      microcalcification. Per group, the number of samples (13 vs. 12) with sufficient 
      signal intensity and total lengths of regions (201 vs. 232 μm) giving rise to 
      diffractograms ("informative regions") were comparable. Summarizing all informative 
      regions per group into one composite sample revealed calcium phosphate/apatite as 
      the leading mineral phase in CKD patients, whereas in patients with normal renal 
      function the relative contribution of whitlockite and calcium phosphate/apatite was 
      on the same order of magnitude (CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 157 μm, whitlockite 
      38.7 μm; non-CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 79.0 μm, whitlockite 94.1 μm; each p < 
      0.05). Our results, although based on a limited number of samples, indicate that 
      chronic impairment of renal function affects local magnesium homeostasis and thus 
      contributes to the physicochemical composition of microcalcification in 
      atherosclerotic patients.

TI  - Are we overconcerned about secondary hyperparathyroidism and underestimating the 
      more common secondary hypoparathyroidism in our dialysis patients?
PG  - 102-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of hyper and 
      hypo-parathyroid state in prevalent dialysis patients. The second part of the study 
      was to look for the prevalence of vascular calcification (abdominal aortic) and 
      factors predicting calcification in these patients. METHODS: All adult patients, who 
      were more than 1 month on dialysis, were included in the study. A total of 68 
      patients, of which 75% were on hemodialysis and 25% on peritoneal dialysis, were 
      finally studied. Patients' parathyroid status was defined as per target 
      recommendation of KDOQI--hypoparathyroid with iPTH < or = 150 pg/ml and 
      hyperparathyroid with iPTH > 300 pg/ml. Vascular calcification was determined by X 
      ray of lateral lumbar spine to look for abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). The 
      AAC was scored as validated. The prevalence of hyper- and hypoparathyroidism in 
      dialysis patients was determined as percentage of total dialysis patients. The 
      prevalence of AAC and factors predicting it was analyzed by 'univariate' and 
      'multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.04 
      +/- 14.15 years, 58.82% were males and 42.64% were diabetics. Mean duration of 
      dialysis was 22.36 +/- 19.17 months. Hyperparathyroidism was seen in only 27.94% of 
      all dialysis patients, while hypoparathyroidism was in 45.58%. Abdominal aortic 
      calcification was seen in 79.41% of overall patients and 13.23% had significant 
      calcification (score 7-24). On univariate analysis, age (0.000) and iPTH (0.03) were 
      the only variables predicting AAC and on logistic regression analysis, age was the 
      only independent predictor of abdominal aortic calcification (p = 0.002, OR 1.11, CI 
      1.038-1.186). CONCLUSION: Hypoparathyroidism is more common (46%) in our dialysis 
      patients as compared to hyperparathyroidism (28%). There is high prevalence of 
      vascular (abdominal aortic) calcification (80%) in our dialysis patients.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation increases 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and fetuin-A 
      levels in dialysis patients.
PG  - 495-502
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2012.06.005 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency, low levels of fetuin-A, and fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF-23) are related to vascular calcification, which is associated with 
      cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid (FA), which has 
      cardioprotective properties, modifies vitamin D status, fetuin-A, and FGF-23 levels 
      in dialysis patients. In a randomized, open-label, controlled study, a total of 47 
      patients treated with dialysis for at least 1 year were randomized to treatment for 
      6 months with omega-3 FAs (Omacor, 3 g/d; Pronova, Sandefjord, Norway) or a control 
      group. Levels of fetuin-A and FGF-23 were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay, 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured by radioimmunoassay. 
      The mean age of the enrolled patients was 57.4 ± 10.4 years, and mean dialysis 
      duration was 46.5 ± 28.1 months. Twenty-seven hemodialysis patients and 16 
      peritoneal dialysis patients finished this trial. After 6 months, the levels of 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and fetuin-A were significantly increased in the group 
      taking the omega-3 FA supplement compared with baseline. Levels of calcium, 
      phosphorous, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, FGF-23, and lipid profiles 
      were not significantly changed in the omega-3 FA-supplemented group after 6 months 
      compared with baseline. The erythrocyte membrane contents of eicosapentaenoic acid 
      and docosahexaenoic acid were significantly increased, and oleic acid content was 
      significantly decreased in the omega-3 FA-supplemented group after 6 months compared 
      with baseline. Regarding vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease, omega-3 
      FA supplementation may have a clinical benefit caused by activating vitamin D, 
      increasing fetuin-A levels, and modifying erythrocyte membrane FA contents in 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification scores improve contrast-induced nephropathy risk 
      assessment in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1298-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of CAC scores for the 
      incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac catheterization in 
      non-dialyzed CKD patients. METHODS: The present study evaluated a total of 140 CKD 
      patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients were stratified into two 
      groups based on the optimal cut-off value of the CAC score, which was graded by a 
      non-triggered, routine diagnostic chest computed tomography scan: CAC score ≥8 (high 
      CAC group); and CAC score <8 (low CAC group). CIN was defined as an increase 
      of >10 % in the baseline serum cystatin C level at 24 h after contrast 
      administration. RESULTS: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate levels were 
      41.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the mean contrast dose administered was 37.5 mL. Patients 
      with high CAC scores exhibited a higher incidence of CIN than patients with low CAC 
      scores (25.5 vs. 3.2 %, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment for confounders, 
      the CAC score predicted CIN (odds ratio 1.68, 95 % confidence interval 1.28-2.21, 
      p < 0.001). Moreover, the C-index for CIN prediction significantly increased when 
      the CAC scores were added to the Mehran risk score (0.855 vs. 0.760, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: CAC scores, as evaluated using semi-quantitative methods, are a simple 
      and powerful predictor of CIN. Incorporating the CAC score in the Mehran risk score 
      significantly improved the predictive ability to predict CIN incidence.

      patients with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 1273-80
AB  - Eleven patients with chronic renal failure and presumed secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism developed a syndrome of medial calcinosis of the arteries and 
      painful ischemic ulcers of the fingers, legs, or thighs, or any combination of the 
      three. Five patients required maintenance hemodialysis; six had functioning renal 
      homografts. Severe hyperphosphatemia had existed in each; seven showed 
      roentgenographic evidence of subperiosteal resorption. Similarities are evident 
      between the lesions and experimentally produced calciphylaxix. The lesions 
      demonstrated a relentless, progressive course, with serious morbidity and mortality. 
      Hyperplastic or adenomatours parathyroid tissue was removed from ten of 11 patients 
      unergoing surgical procedures; healing followed in seven patients. Treatment with 
      phosphate-binding antacids to lower serum phosphorus levels may prevent this 
      syndrome. Total or subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered when ischemic 
      skin lesions appear in uremic patients or in renal transplant recipients.

PG  - 146-52
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfs356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE study assessed the progression of vascular and cardiac valve 
      calcification in 360 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) 
      assigned randomly to treatment either with cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D (≤ 6 
      µg/week of intravenous paricalcitol equivalent) or with varying doses of vitamin D 
      alone for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis, we compared CAC progression 
      among 70 protocol-adherent subjects given cinacalcet and low doses of vitamin D 
      (CPA) as specified in the study protocol and 120 control subjects given vitamin D 
      sterols. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics did not differ between CPA and 
      control subjects. The mean (standard error of the mean, SEM) doses of vitamin D at 
      week 2 were 4.7 (0.3) and 12.8 (1.0) µg/week in CPA and control subjects, 
      respectively, and the corresponding mean cumulative doses of vitamin D over 52 weeks 
      in each group were 225 (22) and 671 (47) µg. The median change in Agatston CAC score 
      after 52 weeks was less in CPA subjects than in controls (17.8% versus 31.3%, P = 
      0.02). The median increase in calcification scores in the aortic valve also was less 
      in CPA subjects than in controls (6.0% versus 51.5% P = 0.02). Reductions in serum 
      parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus levels were significantly greater in CPA 
      subjects than in controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The progression of cardiovascular 
      calcification was attenuated among cinacalcet-treated subjects with sHPT given low 
      doses of vitamin D per protocol compared with control subjects in whom sHPT was 
      treated with higher doses of vitamin D sterols alone.

TI  - Association between vascular calcification scores on plain radiographs and fatty 
      acid contents of erythrocyte membrane in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.01.023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification (VC) scores determined by using simple plain 
      radiographic films are known to be associated with coronary artery disease and 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Omega-3 fatty acid (FA) has been 
      shown to reduce ectopic calcifications in an animal model, and it has also been 
      shown that erythrocyte membrane omega-3 FA content is an independent discriminator 
      of coronary artery disease. The present study was designed to demonstrate relations 
      between VC scores and erythrocyte membrane FA contents in patients undergoing HD. 
      DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out. SETTING: The study was carried out 
      at an outpatient hemodialysis unit at Dong-A University Hospital, Busan, Republic of 
      Korea. PATIENTS: A total of 31 patients undergoing HD were recruited. Patients with 
      significant malnutrition, a short duration of dialysis (<12 months), a history of 
      recent infection, malignancy, or liver disease were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Plain radiographic films of the feet, hands, pelvis, and lateral lumbar spine were 
      examined and VC scores were determined using previously reported methods. 
      Erythrocyte membrane FA contents were analyzed by gas chromatography. RESULTS: The 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were 
      not found to be related with VC on simple plain radiographic films. However, 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of oleic acid and total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) were 
      significantly higher in patients with significant VC scores. Furthermore, 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of MUFA and oleic acid were found to be negatively 
      associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and positively associated 
      with triglyceride level. CONCLUSION: Erythrocyte membrane contents of MUFA and oleic 
      acid were found to be associated with VC scores determined using plain radiographs 
      and with dyslipidemia in patients undergoing HD.

TI  - The sleeve method for creation of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas in patients 
      with calcified vessels.
PG  - 384-389
LID - 10.5301/jva.5000761 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in patients with advanced 
      atherosclerotic changes of the artery is often a challenge for the physician due to 
      difficulties in suturing the vein to the side of the frangible artery. The sleeve 
      technique relies on advancing the end of the artery into the lumen of the vein and 
      protecting the anastomosis by adventitial sutures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sleeve 
      technique was performed in 23 patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV and V 
      and included hemodialysis patients. Their mean age was 60.8 ± 14.8 years and 
      hemodialysis treatment time 49.8 ± 40.2 months. The most frequent causes of chronic 
      kidney disease are ischemic nephropathy (43%, n = 10) and type l diabetes (21%, n = 
      5). Only patients with extremely advanced atherosclerotic were recruited and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: The primary patency rate was 67%, 59%, 44% and 28% at 6, 12, 24, 
      and 36 months, respectively. The secondary patency rate was 67%, 61%, 50% and 37% at 
      6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. In three patients the AVF failed directly 
      after the operation. Delayed fistula failure occurred in seven patients. The overall 
      success in the creation of a functioning fistula was achieved in 15 of the 23 
      patients (65%). No serious complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with calcified atherosclerotic plaques, which constitute a barrier or make it 
      difficult to suture the vein to the side of the artery, the sleeve method may be 
      considered as an alternative before abandoning the creation of a fistula on the 
      forearm. The technique is much simpler than the standard end-to-side or side-to-side 
      anastomosis.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in 
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly 
      recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels 
      of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study 
      investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with 
      all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc 
      survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 
      2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters 
      of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum 
      sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: 
      Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] 
      pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older 
      age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a 
      median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels 
      were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum 
      sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When 
      bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the 
      causal pathway.

LID - 10.1038/ki.2012.118 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery disease is a serious complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD); 
      however, there is little information about coronary plaque morphology in these 
      patients. Here we identified the characteristics of coronary culprit plaques and 
      their clinical manifestations in 78 patients with CKD divided into four groups based 
      on their estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were examined by Virtual 
      Histology-Intravascular Ultrasound, a tomographic imaging method that can visualize 
      atherosclerotic plaques in vivo using radiofrequency analysis of ultrasound 
      backscatter signals. These ultrasound analyses showed an increase in the relative 
      volumes of both dense calcium and necrotic core with decreasing renal function. The 
      necrotic core/dense calcium ratio was significantly higher in patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction compared to those with stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, 
      the necrotic core/dense calcium ratio decreased in advanced CKD. Thus, the plaque 
      composition of coronary culprit lesions changed from necrotic core-rich to 
      extensively calcium-rich plaques as renal function decreased, suggesting that such 
      coronary culprit composition was associated with stability, particularly in advanced 
      CKD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) 
      is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by 
      cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality. METHODS: In 231 ESRD 
      patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, 
      prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were 
      quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of 
      total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were 
      also analysed. RESULTS: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more 
      often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 
      and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox 
      proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause 
      mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and 
      subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) 
      showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly 
      associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from 
      DXA. CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of 
      agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than 
      those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with 
      high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an 
      important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

TI  - High estimated glomerular filtration rate is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification in middle-aged Korean men without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 996-1001
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as well as low eGFR is 
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vascular calcification is a 
      suggested link between low eGFR and worse cardiovascular outcome. However, the 
      association between high eGFR and vascular calcification is not known. The aim of 
      this study is to investigate the relationship between high eGFR and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed middle-aged Korean 
      men in whom coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) and eGFR were measured as part of 
      a health examination program in Korea. Participants with underlying chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer were excluded. CAC was 
      defined as a CACS >100. RESULTS: Among 6986 subjects [age 48.1 (46.5-50.5) years], 
      321 (4.6%) participants had CAC. The percentages of participants with CAC were 5.7, 
      3.8, 4.9 and 6.6 in groups with eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) of 60 ∼ 74, 75 ∼ 89, 90 ∼ 
      104 and 105 ∼ max, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, the odds ratio 
      for CAC in the group with eGFR of 105 ∼ max compared with the group with eGFR of 75 
      ∼ 89 was 2.52 (1.67-3.79, P < 0.001) after adjustment for age, body mass index, 
      diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, glucose, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, hsCRP, calcium, 
      phosphorus, current smoking, alcohol intake and vigorous exercise frequency. 
      CONCLUSIONS: High eGFR is associated with CAC in middle-aged Korean men without CKD. 
      Further studies are needed to verify a causal relationship and clarify the role of 
      high eGFR in the development of CVD.

TI  - Clinical management of calcific uremic arteriolopathy before and after therapeutic 
      inclusion of bisphosphonates.
PG  - 231-4
LID - 10.5414/CN107923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a 
      life-threatening condition almost exclusively affecting patients with end-stage 
      renal failure. Several therapies have been employed to treat this disease with 
      irregular results. METHODS: Comparison of a prospective case series with a 
      historical cohort. Group I: 12 patients with CUA diagnosed before 2002 (5 men, 6 on 
      dialysis and 6 with functioning allografts) treated with standard treatment. Group 
      II: 11 patients with CUA diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 (4 men, 6 on dialysis and 5 
      with functioning allografts) treated with standard treatment and bisphosphonates for 
      6 months. The diagnosis was made by clinical suspicion and a confirmatory biopsy in 
      both groups. Ten patients had a previous history of high calcium-phosphorus product, 
      9 had a history of high parathyroid hormone (> 800 pg/ml) levels, 13 had a history 
      of high cumulative steroids and 9 patients were under dicoumarin treatment. Two 
      patients were obese and 5 had diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: In Group I, 58.7% required 
      amputation of the affected limb, 3 patients recovered and 2 died. In all patients of 
      Group II the progression of the skin lesions decreased between 2 and 4 weeks after 
      the start of bisphosphonate therapy with no changes in blood levels of calcium and 
      phosphate. The improvement in pain and lesions was faster in the patients receiving 
      endovenous bisphosphonates. Renal function remained stable in transplant recipients. 
      No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates could constitute an 
      alternative to treat CUA in addition to standard therapy.

TI  - Association of serum alkaline phosphatase with coronary artery calcification in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1106-14
LID - 10.2215/CJN.06091108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent in vitro studies have shown a link between 
      alkaline phosphatase and vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). High serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with 
      increased death risk in epidemiologic studies of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) 
      patients. We hypothesized that coronary artery calcification is independently 
      associated with increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels in MHD patients. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We examined the association of coronary 
      artery calcification score (CACS) and alkaline phosphatase in 137 randomly selected 
      MHD patients for whom markers of malnutrition, inflammation, and bone and mineral 
      disorders were also measured. RESULTS: Serum alkaline phosphatase was the only 
      measure with significant and robust association with CACS (P < 0.003), whereas 
      either other biochemical markers had no association with CACS or their association 
      was eliminated after controlling for case-mix variables. Serum alkaline phosphatase 
      >120 IU/L was a robust predictor of higher CACS and was particularly associated with 
      the likelihood of CACS >400 (multivariate odds ratio 5.0 95% confidence interval 1.6 
      to 16.3; P = 0.007). Serum alkaline phosphatase of approximately 85 IU/L seemed to 
      be associated with the lowest likelihood of severe coronary artery calcification, 
      but in the lowest tertile of alkaline phosphatase, the CACS predictability was not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: An association between serum alkaline 
      phosphatase level and CACS exists in MHD patients. Given the high burden of vascular 
      calcification in patients with CKD, examining potential therapeutic interventions to 
      modulate the alkaline phosphatase pathway may be warranted.

AB  - Long-term incremental prognostic value of renal function over coronary artery 
      calcium score (CACS) in symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine additive prognostic 
      value of renal function over CACS in patients with acute chest pain suspected of 
      CAD. Renal function and CACS were assessed in patients without known CAD who 
      presented to the emergency department with chest pain from 2005 to 2008. Renal 
      function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). A total of 949 
      patients (804 non-CKD and 145 CKD, age 54 ± 13 years) were included. During the 
      follow-up period of up to 5.3 years, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) occurred in 
      5.7% of patients (19 cardiac deaths, 6 myocardial infarction and 29 late coronary 
      revascularization). Annualized MACE rate was higher in patients in higher CACS 
      categories with and without CKD (p = 0.011 and p < 0.001 respectively). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis, CACS categories (CACS 1-100: HR 3.17, p = 
      0.005; CACS 101-400: HR 7.68, p < 0.001; CACS > 400: HR 8.88, p < 0.001) and CKD (HR 
      10.18, p < 0.001) were independent predictors for MACE. Both adding renal function 
      and CACS significantly improved the overall predictive performance (p < 0.001 for 
      global Chi square increase) from Framingham risk categories or thrombolysis in 
      myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score. Both CACS and renal function were 
      independent predictors for future cardiac events and provided additive prognostic 
      value to each other and over either Framingham risk categories or TIMI risk score.

TI  - Pre-existing Arterial Micro-Calcification Predicts Primary Unassisted Arteriovenous 
      Fistula Failure in Incident Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 665-9
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12365 [doi]
AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access 
      patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of arterial 
      micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD patients. 
      One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operation 
      were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial arterial 
      specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to identify AMiC. 
      We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between positive and 
      negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for evaluating risk 
      factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF failure occurred in 
      45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was greater in the positive 
      AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group had a lower AVF patency 
      rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The presence of AMiC was an 
      independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion, preexisting AMiC of the 
      vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF failure in incident HD 
      patients.

TI  - Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed 
      tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0620-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular 
      disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. 
      Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these 
      measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to 
      determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for 
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computed tomography with contrast medium was 
      performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average 
      age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the 
      volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients 
      were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or 
      hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic 
      abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, 
      and hospitalization or death due to heart failure. RESULTS: Patients were followed 
      for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and 
      male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In 
      contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, 
      maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, 
      or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional 
      computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - Soluble TWEAK level: is it a marker for cardiovascular disease in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients?
PG  - 136-43
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis 
      (sTWEAK) levels follow declining renal function, are strongly associated with 
      endothelial dysfunction and predict cardiovascular events in nondialyzed chronic 
      kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor 
      survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent evidence suggests a role for sTWEAK 
      in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. The aim of the study was to 
      investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and 
      vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial stiffness by pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by carotid 
      Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long-term prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK 
      levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Mean 
      serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 ± 147.5 pg/mL (range 78-937). sTWEAK level was 
      inversely correlated with CA-IMT at a borderline significance (r=-0.168, p=0.05). 
      Neither carotid-radial PWV nor carotid-femoral PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. 
      sTWEAK level was higher in patients with severe vascular calcification (CACs ≥400) 
      compared to patients with CACs <400 (264.5 ± 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 ± 122.4 pg/mL, 
      p=0.02).The association between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after 
      multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a weak inverse correlation 
      between sTWEAK and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary 
      artery calcification in long-term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for 
      sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.

TI  - Low serum fetuin-A concentration predicts poor outcome only in the presence of 
      inflammation in prevalent haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 804-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02032.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular 
      calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote 
      vascular calcification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of 
      inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 
      222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. RESULTS: Serum fetuin correlated 
      negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating 
      inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher 
      mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was 
      lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and 
      inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly 
      independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed 
      compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same 
      variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high 
      fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with 
      high fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are 
      associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of 
      inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and 
      low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Long-term proton pump inhibitor use is associated with vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study using propensity score analysis.
PG  - 635-42
LID - 10.1007/s40264-013-0062-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs that is extensively 
      used for common gastrointestinal disorders and often prescribed long-term for years. 
      Long-term PPI treatment is associated with an increased risk of fractures in the 
      general population. Several studies have suggested a relationship between vascular 
      calcification, which is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
      impaired bone metabolism and fractures. In dialysis patients, vascular 
      calcifications are widespread and are connected to bone health. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of this study was to assess the association between the use of PPIs and vascular 
      calcifications involving the aorta and iliac arteries in haemodialysis patients. 
      METHODS: Between November 2008 and November 2009, 387 patients receiving long-term 
      dialysis treatment (≥1 year) were enrolled in a multicentre (18 Dialysis Units), 
      cross-sectional study. Overall, 76.2 % of patients were receiving long-term PPI 
      treatment. The main outcome measure was calcification of the aorta and iliac 
      arteries in relation to PPI use. Standardized radiographs were sent to the 
      coordinating centre for centralized evaluation in duplicate by two physicians who 
      were blind to PPI status. RESULTS: Arterial calcifications were significantly more 
      common in the PPI group (p < 0.01). Also, the rates of aortic and iliac 
      calcifications considered separately were higher (+12.2 %, p = 0.0254; and +13.6 %, 
      p = 0.0211, respectively). After correction for the propensity score, the odds 
      ratios [ORs] (95 % CI) related to PPI use were aorta 1.89 (1.01-3.54), p = 0.048; 
      iliac arteries 2.27 (1.31-3.92), p = 0.003; aorta and iliac arteries 2.59 
      (1.48-4.53), p = 0.008. The ORs (95 % CI) related to the association of warfarin + 
      PPI were aorta 2.19 (0.95-5.00), p = 0.06; iliac arteries 2.90 (1.07-7.86), p = 
      0.036; aorta and iliac arteries 2.69 (1.03-6.96), p = 0.042. CONCLUSION: In 
      haemodialysis patients, long-term treatment with PPIs, especially in the presence of 
      warfarin treatment, is associated with vascular calcifications.

TI  - The relationship between coronary artery calcium scores and left atrium size in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1661-1666
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1620-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hemodialysis patients have extremely increased cardiovascular mortality. 
      The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in uremic patients receiving 
      hemodialysis reflects the severity of atherosclerotic vascular disease and predicts 
      the cardiovascular events. In cardiac conditions, left atrial (LA) size has a 
      prognostic importance. In this study, relationship between coronary artery 
      calcification and left atrial size was investigated. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study involving 32 hemodialysis patients (16 females, 16 males; mean 
      age, 52.4 ± 14.1 years) receiving HD for ≥6 months. Coronary artery calcium scoring 
      was performed by a 16-MDCT scanner, and CACS was calculated by Agatston score. A 
      calcification was defined as a minimum of two adjacent pixels (>0.52 mm(2)) with a 
      density over 130 Hounsfield units. Patients were divided into two subgroups (group 
      1: CACS ≤ 45.85, n = 16 and group 2: CACS > 45.85, n = 16) according to median CACS 
      value. RESULTS: Mean CACS value of 32 hemodialysis patients was 245.57 ± 373.91. LA 
      size was significantly higher in patients with CACS > 45.85 (group 2) than in 
      patients with CACS ≤ 45.85 (group 1). In the bivariate correlation analysis, total 
      CACS was positively correlated with left atrium size (r = 0.47, p = 0.006). Total 
      CACS was positively correlated with age (r = 0.43, p = 0.014). LA size was 
      positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.42, p = 0.016) and 
      negatively correlated with ejection fraction (r = -0.42, p = 0.016). The clinical 
      parameters such as BMI, duration of dialysis, blood pressure, ejection fraction, 
      serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin, CRP, triglyceride, 
      cholesterol, hemoglobin and ferritin were not independently associated with total 
      CACS. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive relationship between the CACS and LA size 
      measured by echocardiography in hemodialysis patients. Therefore; echocardiography, 
      which is cheaper and non-invasive than tomographic examinations, might be considered 
      for the risk stratification of coronary artery disease in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Association of coronary artery calcium score and vascular dysfunction in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 216-22

AB  - Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of 
      digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with the 
      severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We hypothesized that 
      in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score have a 
      gradient association that follows that of subjects without kidney disease. We 
      examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group of long-term 
      hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart. Area under the 
      curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index of vascular 
      function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia test. Coronary 
      calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography or multidetector 
      computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited hemodialysis patients 
      (age: 58 ± 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and gender-matched controls. In 
      hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was significantly worse (114 ± 72 vs. 
      143 ± 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was higher (525 ± 425 vs. 240 ± 332, P < 0.001). 
      Hemodialysis patients were 14 times more likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared 
      with controls. After adjustment for known confounders, the relative risk for case 
      vs. control for each standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence 
      interval: 1.12-1.93, P = 0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM 
      technology is incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in 
      whom both measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The 
      DTM technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular mortality is associated with vascular calcification (VC) in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. The present study was designed to find factors related 
      with medial artery calcification on the plain radiography of feet by comparing 
      C-reactive protein (CRP), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and lipid 
      profile including oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and to elucidate 
      associations among these factors in HD patients. Forty-eight HD patients were 
      recruited for this study. VC in the feet was detected in 18 patients (37.5%) among 
      total patients and 12 patients (85.7%) among diabetic patients. Diabetes, 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), pulse pressure, ox-LDL/LDL were higher and high 
      density lipoprotein (HDL) was lower in patients with VC than in patients without VC. 
      Negative associations were found between HDL and CRP, PAI-1. PAI-1 had positive 
      association with ox-LDL/LDL. History of CVD was the only determinant of vascular 
      calcification on the plain radiography of feet. Ox-LDL/LDL, HDL, CRP, and PAI-1 were 
      closely related with one another in HD patients. History of CVD is the most 
      important factor associated with the presence of VC and low HDL and relatively high 
      oxidized LDL/LDL ratio may affect VC formation on the plain radiography in the feet 
      of HD patients.

TI  - Extracellular Fluid Excess Is Significantly Associated With Coronary Artery 
      Calcification in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.008935 [doi]
LID - e008935
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular fluid (ECF) excess is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity in patients undergoing dialysis. This study aimed to 
      investigate the relationship between ECF status, which is affected by renal 
      function, and coronary artery calcification (CAC), which is a marker of 
      cardiovascular disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: A total of 1741 patients at all stages of pre-dialysis CKD from the 
      prospective observational cohort of CMERC-HI (Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease 
      Etiology Research Center-High Risk) were analyzed for the association between ECF 
      status and CAC. ECF status was defined as extracellular water-to-total body water 
      ratio (ECW/TBW) measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. ECF excess was 
      defined as ECW/TBW ≥0.390 or ≥0.400 depending on its severity. To define CAC, 
      Agatston coronary artery calcium scores were measured. A total coronary artery 
      calcium score of ≥400 was defined as CAC. The CKD stages were defined according to 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the CKD Epidemiology 
      Collaboration equation. ECW/TBW and the proportion of ECF excess increased with 
      progressing CKD stages. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that 
      ECW/TBW was independently associated with CAC (per 0.01 increase of ECW/TBW, odds 
      ratio 1.168, 95% confidence interval, 1.079-1.264, P<0.001). The adjusted R(2) for 
      predicting higher coronary artery calcium scores and CAC significantly improved 
      after ECW/TBW was added to conventional factors. This association was further 
      confirmed by net reclassification and integrated discriminant improvements, 
      sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: ECF status is 
      independently associated with a high risk of CAC in patients with CKD. STUDY

AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible association of 
      circulating concentrations of sclerostin with abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3-5. 
      METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with CKD3-5D were enrolled. The patients 
      were divided into two groups according to the presence of AAC: an AAC group (n = 99) 
      and a non-AAC group (n = 62). The concentration of serum sclerostin was measured 
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AAC was evaluated using 
      abdominal lateral X-ray examination. The follow-up intervals ranged from 7 to 
      29 months (median 16 months), and cardiovascular events (CVEs) were recorded. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) was 61.5% (99/161). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly higher in an AAC group than in a non-AAC group 
      (P < 0.001), but the concentration in the moderate-to-severe AAC group was lower 
      than in the mild AAC group (P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed 
      that high serum sclerostin, high serum calcium, diabetes, and old age were 
      independently correlated with AAC. Patients with higher sclerostin values had a 
      reduced risk of major cardiovascular events (log-rank test, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Serum sclerostin values are associated with the presence of AAC, but are lower when 
      AAC is moderate to severe. Higher values are predictive of reduced short-term 
      cardiovascular events. Taken together, these results suggest that sclerostin may 
      have a role in the development of or the response to vascular calcification.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify the factors associated with 
      repeated arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure within 1-year, especially the impact of 
      aortic arch calcification (AAC) on patency of AVF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      retrospectively assessed chest radiography in hemodialysis patients who had 
      undergone initial AVF. The extent of AAC was categorized into four grades (0-3). The 
      association between AAC grade, other clinical variables, and repeated failure of AVF 
      was then analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This study 
      included 284 patients (158 males, mean age 61.7 ± 13.1 years). Patients with higher 
      AAC grade were older, had more frequently diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular 
      disease, had lower diastolic blood pressure, and had higher corrected calcium and 
      lower intact parathyroid hormone levels. In multivariate analysis, the presence of 
      higher AAC grade (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.98 (1.43-6.23); p = 
      0.004), lower mean corrected calcium (p = 0.017), and mean serum albumin level (p = 
      0.008) were associated with repeated failure of AVF. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 
      higher AAC grade, lower mean corrected calcium and mean serum albumin level were 
      independently associated with repeated AVF failure within 1 year in hemodialysis 
      patients.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF-23) is the main regulator of phosphate metabolism. In this prospective study, 
      we aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-23 with progression of coronary 
      artery calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Seventy-four HD patients (36 male/38 
      female, mean age: 52 ± 14 years) were included. Serum FGF-23 levels were measured by 
      ELISA. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was measured twice with one year 
      interval. Patients were grouped as progressive (PG) (36 patients-48%) and 
      non-progressive (NPG). RESULTS: Age, serum phosphorus, baseline and first year CACS 
      were found to be significantly higher in the PG compared to NPG group. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were significantly higher in PG [155 (80-468) vs 147 (82-234), p = 0.04]. 
      Patients were divided into two groups according to baseline CACS (low group, CACS ≤ 
      30; high group, CACS > 30). Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly correlated with 
      the progression of CACS (ΔCACS) in the low baseline CACS group (r = 0.51, p = 
      0.006), but this association was not found in high baseline CACS group (r = 0.11, p 
      = 0.44). In logistic regression analysis for predicting the PG patients; serum 
      FGF-23, phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were retained as significant factors in 
      the model. CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF-23 was found to be related to progression of CACS 
      independent of serum phosphorus levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in the 
      progression of vascular calcification especially at the early stages of 
      calcification process in HD patients.

TI  - Increased aortic wall stiffness associated with low circulating fetuin A and high 
      C-reactive protein in predialysis patients.
PG  - c81-7
LID - 10.1159/000228539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification and arterial stiffening are cardiovascular 
      risk factors among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of the study was 
      to analyze relationships between inflammatory markers, fetuin A and arterial wall 
      stiffness in CKD patients in the predialysis period and on maintenance dialysis. 
      METHODS: Serum C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fetuin A, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and other 
      classical markers of atherosclerosis were measured in a group of 155 CKD patients 
      (77 on hemodialysis, HD, 29 on peritoneal dialysis, 49 in CKD stage 5 in the 
      predialysis period) and in 30 healthy volunteers. The aortic pulse wave velocity 
      (aoPWV) was recorded using a tonometric method. RESULTS: The aoPWV, serum hs-CRP and 
      IL-6 were higher and fetuin A levels were lower in all CKD groups than in controls. 
      In multiple regression analysis, the age appeared as the strongest, independent 
      factor increasing arterial wall stiffness in all investigated groups, including 
      controls, whereas the association of aoPWV with IL-6 and fetuin A remained 
      significant only in HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic wall stiffness is higher in CKD 
      patients than in controls, and it already develops in the predialysis period. Age is 
      the principal determinant of arterial wall stiffness also in CKD patients. The 
      acceleration of arterial wall stiffness in CKD is associated with additional 
      factors, i.e. fetuin A deficiency and higher CRP and IL-6.

TI  - High levels of serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 are associated with increased 
      mortality in long haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2792-6
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, a novel bone-derived phosphaturic 
      factor involved in mineral metabolism, is increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD); 
      in dialysis patients, it has been linked to increased mortality rates and vascular 
      calcification (VC). The present investigation aimed to study the factors associated 
      with elevated serum FGF-23 levels in patients treated with long haemodialysis (LHD) 
      sessions and to determine whether a relationship exists between serum FGF-23 levels 
      and patient survival. METHODS: All patients treated in one haemodialysis centre from 
      September 2006 were included in the study. Standard laboratory values, medical 
      history, cardiovascular events and risk factors, medication and FGF-23 levels [ELISA 
      (C-Term) Immutopics] were recorded. Patients received haemodialysis three times a 
      week, on a 5- to 8-h schedule. Patient data were analysed according to FGF-23 
      quartiles. The effect of FGF-23 on the 2-year survival rate was assessed using the 
      Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for confounding variables and according to 
      the serum phosphate tertiles. RESULTS: The study included 219 patients. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were high: 7060 +/- 13 500 RU/mL (median, 2740 RU/mL). In logistical 
      regressions, only calcaemia (P = 0.002), phosphataemia (P = 0.008) and warfarin use 
      (P = 0.04) were associated with the highest FGF-23 quartile. In the subgroup of 
      patients with an estimated VC score, the third and fourth quartiles of the FGF-23 
      levels were associated with more severe VC. In multivariate linear regressions, only 
      phosphataemia remained significantly correlated with FGF-23 (P = 0.04). The 2-year 
      mortality rate was significantly higher for haemodialysis patients with serum FGF-23 
      levels in the higher quartile [P = 0.007; hazard ratio, 2.5 (1.3-5)] than in the 
      first quartile, whereas within the phosphataemia tertiles, the lowest serum FGF-23 
      quartile was associated with lowered mortality. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated 
      a high level of circulating FGF-23 in LHD patients, despite infrequent 
      hyperphosphataemia. However, phosphataemia is still the main factor correlating with 
      serum FGF-23. The association of higher serum FGF-23 levels with mortality and VC, 
      regardless of the serum phosphate levels, has thus been confirmed.

TI  - Prevalence of peripheral vascular calcifications in patients on chronic hemodialysis 
      at a tertiary care center in Beirut: a pilot study.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in patients maintained on 
      chronic hemodialysis. They have been linked to numerous risk factors and have been 
      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The 
      purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of vascular calcifications 
      among dialysis patients in our tertiary care center and to identify the associated 
      risk factors. METHODS: In the current study, we reviewed the charts of 43 patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis at our center. We estimated the prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications among dialysis patients using plain X-ray of the hand as the 
      screening tool. We compared patient's characteristics and tried to identify possible 
      risk factors, with a special emphasis on the subgroup of patients with diabetes. 
      RESULTS: Vascular calcifications were prevalent among half of the patients on 
      hemodialysis. Duration of dialysis (p = 0.02), diabetes (p < 0.001), and 
      hypertension (p = 0.01) were highly associated with vascular calcifications. No 
      association was found between vascular calcifications and age, gender, calcium-based 
      phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, smoking, and lipid control. In 
      multivariate analyses, diabetes and duration of dialysis were the only independent 
      predictors of vascular calcifications and diabetics developed vascular 
      calcifications earlier than nondiabetics (31 months vs 69 months). CONCLUSION: 
      Vascular calcifications are moderately prevalent among patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis at our center, and were found to be strongly correlated with diabetes 
      and duration of dialysis. A larger, multicenter, prospective study should be 
      conducted at national level, in order to confirm the findings of this study and to 
      identify further modifiable risk factors, to decrease the incidence of vascular 
      calcifications and the incurring cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in our 
      population.

TI  - Study on the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients with consideration of seasonal variation in 
      vitamin D levels.
PG  - 563-8
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between seasonal 
      variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification. METHODS: As a prospective 
      observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We have assessed serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer (September) and winter 
      (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association of serum 25D level with 
      vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D levels 
      were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were 
      studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by Kauppila. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the summer and increased to 
      96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and diabetes were associated with 
      vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate analysis, 25D levels were inversely 
      related to vascular calcification. However, after correcting for confounding 
      factors, this relationship lost statistical significance. Multivariate analysis 
      showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels were directly 
      associated with a higher VCS. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent 
      in HD patients with marked seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be 
      identified as an independent predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.

TI  - Effect of cinacalcet treatment on vascular arterial stiffness among peritoneal 
      dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 339-44
LID - 10.1111/nep.12223 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although calcimimetics cinacalcet can reduce parathyroid hormone level and 
      control secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease patients, risk of 
      vascular calcification remains high. Whether cinacalcet can further reduce vascular 
      damage or arterial stiffness is unknown. METHODS: We studied the effect of 
      cinacalcet in 33 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome was the aortic 
      pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment. The pulse wave 
      velocity was compared with that of a matched control cohort of 37 peritoneal 
      dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients 
      completed the cinacalcet treatment, after median dialysis duration of 1.0 year. 
      Significant improvement of parathyroid hormone level was achieved after 52 weeks, 
      from 87.5 ± 28.7 pmol/L to 34.5 ± 45.5 pmol/L (P < 0.0001). Serial carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity did not differ between cinacalcet treatment group and control 
      group (general linear model with repeated measures, P = 0.19). Among patients 
      receiving cinacalcet, the average carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity increased from 
      10.46 ± 2.12 m/s at baseline to 11.41 ± 2.79 m/s at 52 weeks (P = 0.001). The change 
      in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity over 1 year had no significant correlation 
      with the final parathyroid hormone level or change in parathyroid hormone level. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among prevalent patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and with 
      hyperparathyroidism, a reduction of 60.6% parathyroid hormone level after cinacalcet 
      treatment for one year did not reduce the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity.

TI  - High Serum Sclerostin Levels Are Associated with a Better Outcome in Haemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1159/000443845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis. 
      Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification 
      (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin 
      levels are high. AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, 
      bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum 
      sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and 
      survival rate. RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin 
      level of 1.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum 
      sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were 
      significantly older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male 
      gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 
      ± 9 vs. 20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed 
      lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD 
      scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate 
      compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% 
      CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher 
      BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to perform a prospective head-to-head comparison of 
      the predictive value of clinical risk factors and a variety of cardiac imaging 
      modalities including coronary artery calcium score (CACS), coronary computed 
      tomography angiography (CTA), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), 
      and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and 
      all-cause mortality in kidney transplantation candidates. BACKGROUND: Current 
      guidelines recommend screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplantation 
      candidates. Furthermore, noninvasive stress imaging is recommended in current 
      guidelines, despite its low diagnostic accuracy and uncertain prognostic value. 
      METHODS: The study prospectively evaluated 154 patients referred for kidney 
      transplantation. All patients underwent CACS, coronary CTA, SPECT, and ICA testing. 
      The clinical endpoints were extracted from patients' interviews, patients' records, 
      and registries. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.7 years. In total, 27 (17.5%) 
      patients experienced MACE, and 31 (20.1%) patients died during follow-up. In a 
      time-to-event analysis, both risk factors and CACS significantly predicted death, 
      but only CACS predicted MACE. Combining risk factors with CACS identified a 
      very-low-risk cohort with a MACE event rate of 2.1%, and a 1.0% mortality rate per 
      year. Of the diagnostic modalities, coronary CTA and ICA significantly predicted 
      MACE, but only coronary CTA predicted death. In contrast, SPECT predicted neither 
      MACE nor death. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional risk factors and other 
      cardiac imaging modalities, CACS and coronary CTA seem superior for risk 
      stratification in kidney transplant candidates. Applying a combination of 
      risk factors and CACS and subsequently coronary CTA seems to be the most appropriate 
      strategy. (Angiographic CT of Renal Transplantation Candidate Study [ACToR]; 
      NCT01344434).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) associated to chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      is a complex phenomenon closely related to mineral bone metabolism disorders. Many 
      are the factors implicated, as the drugs used in the treatment of CKD. Some in vitro 
      studies suggest that electrolyte and acid-base disorders induced by hemodialysis 
      (HD) may play a key role in VC. METHODS: We analyzed electrolyte and acid-base 
      disorders that occur during an HD session in 26 patients randomly assigned to 1,25 
      mM or 1,5 mM calcium bath. RESULTS: There is a calcium load in all the patients, 
      independently of calcium bath concentration or basal serum calcium levels. At the 
      end of the session, 100% of the patients dialyzed with 1,5 mM calcium bath have 
      calcium serum levels > 1,3 mM. However, this only occurs in 15% of the patients 
      dialysed with 1,25 mM calcium bath. During this calcium load, phosphorus levels 
      persist uncontrolled. Besides, there is a progressive alkalinization in all the 
      patients. In the end of the session 50% have serum bicarbonate > 30 mM and 23% pH > 
      7,5. CONCLUSIONS: During HD sessions occur electrolyte and acid-base disorders that 
      induce VC: Calcium load and alkalization in presence of elevated phosphorus levels. 
      It is necessary to perform studies with kinetic models of calcium load and 
      alkalinization different from the actual ones.

AB  - Gross vascular calcification seen on imaging studies is common in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients, and is a significant predictor for cardiovascular mortality in HD 
      patients. We have reported that arterial microcalcification (AMiC) of the vascular 
      access is associated with increased aortic stiffness. This study investigated the 
      impact of vascular access AMiC on cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. The study 
      included 149 HD patients (mean age: 59.1 ± 13.9 years, 86 men and 63 women, 65.8% 
      diabetic) who underwent vascular access surgery. Radial or brachial artery specimens 
      were obtained intraoperatively, and pathologic examination was performed using von 
      Kossa stain to identify AMiC. We compared all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
      between patients with and without AMiC. The mean follow-up was 37.8 ± 34.5 months, 
      and AMiC was present in 38.8% (n = 57) of patients. The presence of diabetes (odds 
      ratio: 16.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.81-150.36, P = 0.013) was the only 
      independent risk factor for vascular access AMiC. During the observational period, 
      there were 27 cardiovascular deaths. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased 
      cardiovascular mortality risk (log rank = 4.83, P = 0.028) in AMiC patients, and Cox 
      regression analysis confirmed that AMiC was an independent predictor for 
      cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio: 2.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.09, 
      P = 0.030). In conclusion, vascular access AMiC is a strong risk factor for 
      cardiovascular mortality in HD patients.

AB  - The negative relation of serum adiponectin to atherosclerosis becomes a positive 
      association in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a 
      small-scale cross-sectional observational study, in 101 Japanese male hemodialysis 
      patients, to examine the relationship of serum adiponectin and leptin to abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC). The presence of AAC was evaluated from simple X-ray 
      radiographs of the left lateral abdomen. Serum adiponectin was significantly higher 
      in AAC-positive patients [18.8 (13.0-28.1) μg/mL] than in AAC-negative patients 
      [15.4 (8.9-22.8) μg/mL] (p = 0.03), whereas serum leptin did not differ 
      significantly between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed 
      that log adiponectin, but not log leptin, was independently and significantly 
      associated in a positive manner with AAC (odds ratio: 16.31, 95% confidence 
      interval: 1.70-156.41, p = 0.02), after adjustment for age, body weight, percentage 
      body fat, hemodialysis duration, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and other risk 
      factors. In conclusion, we found a positive and independent association of serum 
      adiponectin with AAC in male hemodialysis patients, indicating that the reversed 
      association between serum adiponectin and atherosclerosis in patients with CKD dose 
      not result from increased serum adiponectin due to the impaired urinary secretion.

      transplant recipients.
PG  - 811-7
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000000409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of preexisting microcalcification in the iliac 
      artery is undetermined in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We obtained iliac 
      artery segments from 90 transplant recipients at the time of renal transplantation 
      and performed von Kossa staining for microcalcification. The clinical significance 
      of intimal microcalcification was evaluated with allograft survival rate, rate of 
      graft function decline, and composite of any cardiovascular event or patient death. 
      Expression of fetuin-A and C-reactive protein, key regulators of calcification, was 
      also investigated in the iliac artery. RESULTS: Intimal microcalcification was 
      positive in 48 (53.3%) patients, and its intensity was correlated positively with 
      intimal C-reactive protein intensity (P = 0.019). Allograft survival in patients 
      positive for intimal microcalcification was lower than patients who were negative (P 
      = 0.017). The patients with positivity for both intimal microcalcification and 
      fetuin-A showed lower allograft survival rate than patients with intimal 
      microcalcification positivity alone (P = 0.012). The rate of renal graft function 
      decline was significantly steeper in patients positive for intimal 
      microcalcification than in patients who were negative (P = 0.036). In multivariate 
      analysis, positivity for both intimal microcalcification and fetuin-A was an 
      independent predictor for renal graft function decline (β = -10.21; P = 0.011). The 
      intimal microcalcification was not associated with composite-event free survival. 
      CONCLUSION: Preexisting intimal microcalcification in the iliac artery predicts a 
      lower allograft survival rate and rapid decline of allograft function. Positivity of 
      fetuin-A with intimal microcalcification further reduces allograft survival rate and 
      an independent predictor for renal graft function decline.

TI  - Serum Soluble Klotho Level Is Associated with Abdominal Aortic Calcification in 
      Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klotho is a single transmembrane protein originally identified as an 
      ‘aging suppressor'. Emerging evidence reveals that soluble Klotho (sKl) in the 
      circulation plays important roles in anti-aging, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and 
      Wnt signaling. However, the role of serum sKl in the vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients is not clear. The aim of this study was to determine the 
      associations of sKl with abdominal aortic calcification in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: 129 MHD patients were enrolled prospectively. Serum sKl 
      level was detected by ELISA. Abdominal aortic calcification was measured by abdomen 
      lateral plain radiograph, and the abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) score was 
      calculated. The sKl levels were observed in patients with different degrees of 
      calcification. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factor of 
      abdominal aortic calcification in MHD patients. The diagnostic value of sKl for 
      abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using receiver operator characteristic 
      (ROC). RESULTS: Abdominal aortic calcification was seen in 87 of 129 patients. The 
      median AAC score was 4.0 (0.00, 11.00) and the median sKl level was 616.29 (378.19, 
      821.61) pg/ml. Serum sKl levels were inversely associated with AAC. When evaluated 
      as AAC categories (<5, 5-15, >15) with ordinal logistic regression, each SD higher 
      sKl was associated with 37.1% lower odds of AAC severity (proportional odds ratio: 
      0.629; 95% confidence interval: 0.413-0.959, p = 0.031) in models adjusted for 
      demographic data, lifestyle factors, traditional CVD risk factors and uremic risk 
      factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum sKl levels and 
      smoking were independent risk factors for severe AAC. The area under the 
      receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of serum sKl for severe abdominal 
      aortic calcification was 0.746 (0.612-0.880, p = 0.001), sensitivity was 0.885, and 
      specificity was 0.562 for a cutoff value of 265.39 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 
      sKl levels are independently associated with severe AAC. Serum sKl might have a 
      diagnostic value for the severe AAC in MHD patients.

TI  - Monckeberg's calciphylaxis with necrosis of the glans penis: a case presentation.
PG  - 300-2
AB  - Monckeberg's calcific sclerosis of the media of the small-sized and medium-sized 
      arteries is a well described and potentially life-threatening condition seen almost 
      exclusively in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and with 
      hyperparathyroidism. Penile gangrene resulting from this entity is associated with a 
      mortality as high as 64%. A 65-year-old man with ESRD on dialysis for 6 years was 
      referred to Harborview Medical Center with severe penile pain and partial necrosis 
      of his glans penis, which progressed despite medical management. The patient had 
      previously undergone amputations on all four extremities. After intraoperative 
      biopsies of the proximal corpora cavernosa and spongiosum demonstrated viable 
      tissue, he underwent partial penectomy. Pathologic evaluation revealed calciphylaxis 
      within the media of the penile vessels. Two months later the patient had persistent 
      wound-healing issues with intractable pain and thus underwent a complete penectomy 
      with ultimate resolution of his severe pain.

TI  - Hypervolemia rather than arterial calcification and extracoronary atherosclerosis is 
      the main determinant of pulse pressure in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1203-10
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0024-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulse pressure (PP) has been reported as an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate association of PP with echocardiographic and vascular structural changes 
      such as atherosclerosis and arterial calcifications in HD patients. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 108 chronic hemodialysis patients (49 male, 
      59 female, mean age: 46 ± 13 years) were included. Biochemical analyses, 
      echocardiographic and high-resolution carotid Doppler examinations were done. Aortic 
      wall and coronary artery calcifications were measured with electron beam computed 
      tomography. The degree of carotid artery stenosis was measured at four different 
      sites (communis, bulbus, interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. RESULTS: PP 
      was strongly correlated with systolic (r: 0.82) and diastolic (r: 0.33) blood 
      pressure, left ventricular mass index (r: 0.58), left ventricle end diastolic 
      diameter (r: 0.38) and weakly correlated with aortic wall calcification score (r: 
      0.26) and carotid plaque score (r: 0.27), but not with coronary artery calcification 
      score. Patients with carotid plaque had higher PP than patients without plaque (50 ± 
      16 mmHg versus 44 ± 14 mmHg, P = 0.05). Patients were divided into three groups 
      according to aortic wall calcification score. PP was significantly higher in 
      patients with higher aortic wall calcification (54 ± 16 mmHg) than patients with 
      lower aortic wall calcification (44 ± 15 mmHg, P = 0.04). However, on multivariate 
      linear regression analysis for predicting PP, the only significant factor retained 
      was left ventricle end diastolic diameter. CONCLUSION: PP was weakly associated with 
      large vessel calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. The bulk of 
      the effect on PP seems to be due to hypervolemia.

TI  - Cardiac Assessment of Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Median 10 Years After Successful 
      Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney Transplantation Compared With Living Donor Kidney 
      Transplantation.
PG  - 1261-1267
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recipients with type 1 diabetes, we aimed to determine whether 
      long-term normoglycemia achieved by successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney 
      (SPK) transplantation could beneficially affect progression of coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) when compared with transplantation of a kidney-alone from a living 
      donor (LDK). METHODS: In 42 kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts who 
      had received either SPK (n = 25) or LDK (n = 17), we studied angiographic 
      progression of CAD between baseline (pretransplant) and follow-up at 7 years or 
      older. In addition, computed tomography scans for measures of coronary artery 
      calcification and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function 
      were addressed at follow-up. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 10.1 years 
      (interquartile range [IQR], 9.1-11.5) progression of CAD occurred at similar rates 
      (10 of 21 cases in the SPK and 5 of 14 cases in the LDK group; P = 0.49). Median 
      coronary artery calcification scores were high in both groups (1767 [IQR, 321-4035] 
      for SPK and 1045 [IQR, 807-2643] for LDK patients; P = 0.59). Left ventricular 
      systolic function did not differ between the 2 groups. The SPK and LDK recipients 
      were similar in age (41.2 ± 6.9 years vs 40.5 ± 10.3 years; P = 0.80) and diabetes 
      duration at engraftment but with significant different mean HbA1c levels of 5.5 ± 
      0.4% for SPK and 8.3 ± 1.5% for LDK patients (P < 0.001) during follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with both type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, SPK 
      recipients had similar progression of CAD long-term compared with LDK recipients. 
      Calcification of coronary arteries is a prominent feature in both groups long-term 
      posttransplant.

TI  - Circulating S100A12 Levels Are Associated with Progression of Abdominal Aortic 
      Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - e0150145
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0150145 [doi]
LID - e0150145
AB  - Vascular calcification is an important factor associated with mortality in dialysis 
      patients. Recently, soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product (sRAGE) and 
      extracellular RAGE binding protein S100A12 (EN-RAGE) have been reported to be 
      involved in the process of vascular calcification. Therefore, we investigated 
      whether sRAGE and S100A12 are useful indicators of progression of abdominal aortic 
      calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We analyzed annual changes in vascular 
      calcification score (VCS) for up to 4 years, compared to clinical and biological 
      parameters in 149 HD patients. VCS was assessed annually using plain X-ray images of 
      the lateral lumbar spine. The progression group was defined as patients with an 
      increase in VCS more than 1 point each year on average during the observation 
      period. Time-averaged concentrations were also evaluated to examine the association 
      between biological parameters and changes in VCS. The patients had a mean age of 
      58.59 ± 12.93 years; 53.7% were male, and 45% were diabetic. The VCS increased in 55 
      patients; the mean increase was 1.60 ± 2.91 points. In a stepwise multivariate 
      logistic analysis, we found that higher levels of S100A12 were significantly 
      associated with progression of VCS (odds ratio [OR], 2.622; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 1.371-5.016; P = 0.004). The relationship between sRAGE and VCS was not 
      statistically significant (OR, 0.644; 95% CI, 0.302-1.374; P = 0.255). Our findings 
      suggest that serum levels of S100A12 are associated with progression of abdominal 
      aortic calcification in HD patients, independent of sRAGE level.

      B2M has an impact in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on dialysis. 
      Here we studied the relationship of plasma B2M levels to clinical and cardiovascular 
      outcomes in 142 patients (mean age of 67 years) at different stages of CKD. B2M 
      levels increased with CKD stage and thus were highest in hemodialysis patients. 
      Baseline B2M levels were associated with vascular calcification but not with 
      arterial stiffness or bone density. During a mean follow-up of 969 days, 44 patients 
      died and 49 suffered a cardiovascular event. Higher B2M levels were independently 
      associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in 
      the whole cohort and with cardiovascular events in the predialysis cohort. Moreover, 
      B2M appeared to be a better predictor than well-established factors associated with 
      outcomes in this population, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate ((eGFR), 
      only for predialysis patients), inflammation biomarkers, and other factors included 
      in a propensity score. Thus, we confirm the strong relationship between B2M levels 
      and eGFR and confirm the power of B2M to predict overall and cardiovascular 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients at different stages of CKD.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
      with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-41
LID - 10.5414/CN108716 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role 
      of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess 
      the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular 
      calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients. METHODS: Left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D echocardiography. Intact FGF23 
      blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, 
      USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial 
      stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). 
      Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragão score. RESULTS: In 
      unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 
      0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), 
      dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was 
      negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = 
      -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted 
      analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (β = 
      0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, 
      gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic 
      blood pressure. There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in 
      multivariable- adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is 
      associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or 
      vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Bone mineral density, vascular calcifications, and arterial stiffness in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 668-72
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation of bone mineral density 
      (BMD), evaluated by DXA, with vascular calcifications, arterial stiffness, and 
      vascular disease in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Vascular calcifications were 
      evaluated by vascular calcification score on plain x ray, and arterial stiffness was 
      measured by pulse wave velocity using the Complior device (Artech Medical, Pantin, 
      France). Adjusting for multiple factors, lower BMD at the femoral neck, but not at 
      the lumbar spine, was associated with higher pulse wave velocity (p = 0.037), higher 
      vascular calcification score (p = 0.013), and peripheral artery disease (p = 0.006). 
      These data reinforce the hypothesis of the existence of a link between bone disease 
      and cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients.

AB  - Blood pressure (BP) response to volume depletion induced by hemodialysis (HD) 
      treatment may be important to understand the pathophysiology of the increased 
      mortality in HD patients with vascular calcification. In the present study a 
      comparison between end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients affected by peripheral 
      vascular disease (PVD) and ESRD patients without PVD was performed. Continuous blood 
      pressure was recorded at the beginning and at the end of HD. BP and heart rate 
      variability (HRV) were analyzed to quantify the autonomic nervous system regulation 
      of heart beat and peripheral resistance. PVD patients showed an increase of pulse 
      pressure (PP) during HD, an altered autonomic peripheral control, a lower 
      sympathetic activity, with respect to ESRD patients without PVD.

TI  - SIRTUIN 1 gene polymorphisms are associated with cholesterol metabolism and coronary

PG  - 114-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity gene, protects cells against oxidative 
      and genotoxic stress. This study aimed to investigate the association of SIRT 1 gene 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms, namely, rs7895833, rs7069102, and rs2273773 with 
      lipid profiles and coronary artery calcification score in 219 Japanese hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. METHODS: Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers assay. RESULTS: The A 
      allele frequency of rs7895833 and G allele frequency of rs7069102 were significantly 
      lower in HD patients (0.228 and 0.131, respectively) than those in 803 control 
      subjects (general population) (0.289 and 0.181, respectively) (P = .010 and P = 
      .012, respectively). However, the allele frequency of rs2273773 was not 
      significantly different from that in the control subjects. Multivariate analysis 
      adjusted for age and duration on HD demonstrated that the serum levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly high in G allele carriers of 
      rs7069102 compared with CC genotype in male HD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcification score was significantly high in C allele carriers of rs2273773 in all 
      and male HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT 1 polymorphisms, rs7069102 and rs2273773, 
      are associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism and coronary artery 
      calcification, respectively, in Japanese HD patients, especially in males.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher mortality 
      in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to correlate 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS: A survival 
      analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed by multidetector-row 
      computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0∼105 U), group 2 (110∼1067 
      U), and group 3 (1094∼15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months. 
      Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD 
      duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly 
      lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and 52.2%, 
      respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%, respectively). Cox 
      proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration revealed that 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than 
      those of groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: CACS is helpful to predict prognosis of HD 
      patients independently of age and HD duration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an independent predictor of 
      increased mortality in patients on dialysis and those undergoing renal 
      transplantation. We investigated PH and its association with vascular calcification 
      and endothelial dysfunction in renal transplant patients. METHODS: The records of 
      300 consecutive patients who underwent renal transplant in our center between 2005 
      to 2012 were evaluated. PH was defined as systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) 
      ≥ 35 mm Hg. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, pulse wave velocity 
      (PWv), and renal recessive indices (RRI) were collected and compared among patients 
      with and without PH. RESULTS: Eight patients in PH group (age 36 [19] years) and 87 
      subjects in nPH group (age 35 [9] years) were evaluated. Demographic and clinical 
      characteristics and laboratory data of the 2 groups were similar. Additionally, sPAP 
      was positively correlated with PWv (r = 0.263, P = .01). In multivariate analyses, 
      RRI (P = .004), serum CRP (P = .025), and PWv (P = .001) were associated with 
      pulmonary artery pressure. CONCLUSION: PH is significantly associated with arterial 
      stiffness in renal transplant recipients who have a high risk for cardiovascular 
      disease. Considering the common prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, including PH, 
      we suggested that all patients with renal transplantation should be evaluated for 
      regular echocardiographic examination in clinical practice.

TI  - Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria predict mortality independently from 
      coronary artery calcified plaque in the Diabetes Heart Study.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-12-68 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains an 
      important priority in the management of associated morbidity and mortality, 
      including from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The current investigation examined 
      whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin:creatinine 
      ratio (UACR) were independent predictors of CVD-mortality in European Americans 
      (EAs) with T2D after accounting for subclinical CVD. METHODS: The family-based 
      Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) cohort (n=1,220) had baseline measures of serum 
      creatinine, eGFR, UACR and coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC) assessed by 
      non-contrast computed tomography scan. Cox proportional hazards regression was 
      performed to determine risk for all-cause mortality and CVD-mortality associated 
      with indices of kidney disease after accounting for traditional CVD risk factors and 
      CAC as a measure of subclinical CVD. RESULTS: Participants were followed for 8.2±2.6 
      years (mean±SD) during which time 247 (20.9%) were deceased, 107 (9.1%) from CVD. 
      Univariate analyses revealed positive associations between serum creatinine 
      (HR:1.56; 95% CI:1.37-1.80; p<0.0001) and UACR (1.59; 1.43-1.77; p>0.0001) and 
      negative associations between serum albumin (0.74; 0.65-0.84; p<0.0001) and eGFR 
      (0.66; 0.58-0.76; p<0.0001) with all-cause mortality. Associations remained 
      significant after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, as well as for CAC. 
      Similar trends were noted when predicting risk for CVD-mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      DHS reveals that kidney function and albuminuria are independent risk factors for 
      all-cause mortality and CVD-mortality in EAs with T2D, even after accounting for 
      CAC.

AB  - We used high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine possible changes in 
      the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and to investigate 
      their influence on vascular calcification in uremic patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD). 36 uremic patients had cardiovascular diseases after MHD (MHD 
      group1) and 30 uremic patients did not (MHD group 2), and 20 healthy volunteers were 
      the control group. The extent of coronary artery calcification was assessed with 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS). AFM was used to analyze PBMCs nuances. 
      Concentrations of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in PBMC supernatants were 
      detected by ELISA. Protein expressions of BMP-2 were measured by Western blot. No 
      significant differences in PBMC morphology were observed among groups by light 
      microscopy. AFM images revealed that uremic patients exhibited significant 
      differences of PBMC morphology and vascular calcification when compared with healthy 
      volunteers. The PBMCs in uremic patients were larger in volume, mean height, 
      half-maximum amplitude, average roughness and higher concentrations and expression 
      of BMP-2 and CACS (P < 0.05), with granular processes or caveolae of uneven size 
      distributed over cell surfaces. These differences were also significant between MHD 
      group 1 and group 2 (P < 0.05). PBMC volume, mean height, half-maximum amplitude, 
      and average roughness were positively correlated with BMP-2 and CACS. Moreover, the 
      correlation PBMC with BMP-2 was higher than with CACS. PBMC morphology in MHD 
      patients was related to the degree of vascular calcification. The larger mean 
      height, half-maximum amplitude, average roughness and cell volume were, the higher 
      degree of vascular calcification was.

TI  - Severe asymptomatic coronary obstruction in chronic hemodialysed patient - a case 
      report.
PG  - 424-428
AB  - Introduction. Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent 
      predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on renal 
      replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class. Case report. We 
      report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known with CKD stage 5D 
      on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral disease, admitted for 
      progressive right leg pain. The physical examination detected right dorsalis pedis 
      artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry emphasized hypercalcemia, 
      hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, metabolic acidosis, 
      hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray of right shin highlighted 
      a vascular calcification with a "train track" aspect on the tibial-peroneal artery 
      trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low ray regime) showed calcium deposits 
      in coronary arteries walls. Legs arteriography and coronary angiography were 
      performed revealing multiple lesions on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing 
      of right coronary artery. The particularity of the case lies in the absence of 
      angina in a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant 
      angiographically stenosis of the coronary arteries were found and successful 
      endovascular therapy was performed. Conclusion. The broadening of the indication for 
      coronary angiography should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D 
      patients based on a risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base 
      imbalances, while considering their major influence on the structure and tone of 
      vascular walls thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Abbreviations.

TI  - Arteriovenous grafts: early ultrasonography tells their fortune.
PG  - 420-5
LID - 10.1159/000433607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patency of arteriovenous grafts (AVG) for hemodialysis is mostly 
      limited by growing stenoses that lead to decreasing of blood flow, thromboses and 
      finally to access failure. The aim of this study was to find out if detection of any 
      pathology by duplex Doppler ultrasonography (DDU) early after creation of AVG could 
      identify those with lower survival. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled AVG 
      examined by DDU in our center within 40 days after their creation during the last 10 
      years. The findings were divided into 4 subgroups: (1a) normal finding, (1b) DDU 
      risk factor (low flow volume, medial calcinosis of the feeding artery, presence of 
      intimal hyperplasia in the venous anastomosis), (2a) non-significant or (2b) 
      significant stenosis. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative survival of 
      people with AVGs, and the secondary was the primary (unassisted) survival. All 
      patients underwent DDU surveillance every 3 months with pre-emptive treatment of 
      significant stenoses. RESULTS: Overall, 340 cases were found; the median follow-up 
      was 565 days. Normal DDU finding had 60% cases, DDU risk factor 18% cases, 
      non-significant stenosis 13% cases and significant stenosis 9% cases. Occurrence of 
      early significant stenosis was associated with high risk of access loss (hazards 
      ratio (HR) 14.73; 95% CI 5.10-42.58; p < 0.0001). Similarly, the presence of a DDU 
      risk factor and of a non-significant stenosis were related to significantly shorter 
      access lifespan (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.10-7.40; p = 0.03 and HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.12-7.17; 
      p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: DDU examination of AVG early after their 
      creation can identify those at higher risk and may contribute to individualize the 
      surveillance strategy.

TI  - The association between coronary artery calcification progression and loss of bone 
      density in non-dialyzed CKD patients.
PG  - 425-31
LID - 10.5414/CN107515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and low bone density are coexisting 
      deleterious conditions commonly shared by chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In 
      the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the progression of CAC was 
      associated with overtime reduction in bone density in non-dialyzed CKD patients. 
      METHODS: This is a prospective study of 24 months including 72 non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients Stages 2 - 4 (age 57.6 ± 10.3 years, 62% male, 22% diabetics). CAC and 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) were measured by computed tomography. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 46% of the patients had CAC (calcified group) and calcification was not 
      identified in 54% of the patients (non-calcified group). The calcified group was 
      older, predominantly male, and had lower VBD in comparison to non-calcified group. 
      CAC progression was observed only in the calcified group (91% of the patients 
      increased calcium score). The multiple regression analysis revealed loss of VBD as 
      the independent determinant of CAC progression in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: CAC 
      progression was associated with loss of VBD in non-dialyzed CKD patients.

TI  - Normal body mass index with central obesity has increased risk of coronary artery 
      calcification in Korean patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1368-1376
LID - S0085-2538(16)30537-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.kint.2016.09.011 [doi]
AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), overweight and mild obesity have shown the lowest 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, central obesity has been directly associated with 
      CV risk in these patients. This bidirectional relationship of body mass index (BMI) 
      and central obesity prompted us to evaluate CV risk based on a combination of BMI 
      and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in nondialysis CKD patients. We included 1078 patients 
      with CKD stage 2 through 5 (nondialysis) enrolled in a nationwide prospective cohort 
      of Korea. Patients were divided into 3 groups by BMI (normal BMI, 18.5-22.9; 
      overweight, 23.0-27.4; and obese, 27.5 and over kg/m(2)) and were dichotomized by a 
      sex-specific median WHR (0.92 in males and 0.88 in females). Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) was determined by multislice computed tomography. CAC (score 
      above 10 Agatston units) was found in 477 patients. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that BMI was not independently associated with CAC. However, WHR 
      showed an independent linear and significant association with CAC (odds ratio, 
      1.036; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.065 per 0.01 increase). Furthermore, when 
      patients were categorized into 6 groups according to a combination of BMI and WHR, 
      normal BMI but higher WHR had the highest risk of CAC compared with the normal BMI 
      with lower WHR group (2.104; 1.074-4.121). Thus, a normal BMI with central obesity 
      was associated with the highest risk of CAC, suggesting that considering BMI and 
      WHR, 2 surrogates of obesity, can help to discriminate CV risk in Korean nondialysis 
      CKD patients.

TI  - Prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in hemodialysis patients--a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0026-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery calcification has been reported to be an independent 
      risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also, existence of a positive correlation has been 
      reported between the presence of arterial calcification and that of ischemic changes 
      in the area supplied by such arteries. While intracranial artery calcification has 
      frequently been observed on computed tomographic (CT) images of the brain in 
      hemodialysis patients, its prevalence has not been reported previously. We 
      investigated our hemodialysis outpatients to determine the prevalence of 
      intracranial artery calcification in these patients in comparison with that in 
      healthy controls. METHODS: Brain CT examinations were performed in 107 patients 
      under maintenance hemodialysis therapy. For comparison, 43 representatives of the 
      general population who underwent a brain CT examination as part of a health checkup 
      were also studied as control subjects. RESULTS: Intracranial calcifications were 
      more frequently found among hemodialysis patients (87.9%) than among control 
      subjects (53.5%, P = 0.0003), and the prevalences of calcification in each of the 
      intracranial arteries in the two groups were as follows: vertebral artery (65.5% vs. 
      25.6%, P = 0.0002), internal carotid artery (62.1% vs. 18.6%, P < 0.0001), basilar 
      artery (34.5% vs. 34.9%, ns), anterior cerebral artery (0 vs. 2.3%, ns), middle 
      cerebral artery (24.1% vs. 20.9%, ns), and posterior cerebral artery (5.2% vs. 4.7%, 
      ns). CONCLUSIONS: A much higher rate of intracranial artery calcification was 
      observed in hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and the most 
      frequently involved sites of calcification in these patients were the relatively 
      large intracranial arteries.

TI  - QT dispersion predicts mortality and correlates with both coronary artery 
      calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 599-605
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0549-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: QT dispersion (QTd) was shown to be an independent predictor of mortality 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients. It may be hypothesized that coronary artery 
      calcification is related to QTd in HD patients because widespread calcification may 
      also involve the cardiac conducting system in these patients. In this study, we 
      aimed to investigate the relationships of corrected QTd (QTcd) with coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS), carotid plaque score (CPS) and possible influence of 
      these parameters on survival of HD patients. METHODS: Seventy-two HD patients (33 
      male, 39 female) were enrolled into the study. Mean age of the patients was 44 ± 12 
      years. Mean follow-up duration was 77 ± 24 months. CACS was determined by computed 
      tomography. QTcd values were calculated as the difference of maximum and minimum QT 
      intervals. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and CPS were measured by 
      echocardiography. RESULTS: QTcd was significantly correlated with CACS (r = 0.233, p 
      = 0.049), CPS (r = 0.354, p = 0.003) and LVMI (p = 0.011, r = 0.299). CPS was found 
      to be significantly higher in the group with high QTcd (>60 ms) [2 (1-4) versus 0 
      (0-1), p = 0.02]. CACS was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.44, p < 0.001), 
      LVMI (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and CPS (r = 0.32, p = 0.003). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, 
      survival of patients with high QTcd was significantly lower than the patients with 
      low QTcd. In Cox regression analysis for predicting mortality, age, serum albumin 
      and QTcd were found to be the independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: QTcd 
      independently predicted mortality, and it was significantly associated with coronary 
      artery calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy and atherosclerosis in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Circulating levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product are 
      inversely associated with vascular calcification in patients on haemodialysis 
      independent of S100A12 (EN-RAGE) levels.
PG  - 777-82

AB  - AIM: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has emerged as a 
      central regulator of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) 
      has an anti-inflammatory effect by quenching ligands for RAGE. On the other hand, 
      extracellular RAGE-binding protein S100A12 (EN-RAGE) shows a pro-inflammatory effect 
      in a way, but may play pleiotropic roles related to inflammatory process. Therefore, 
      we determined the levels of sRAGE and S100A12 in haemodialysis (HD) patients and 
      evaluated their relationship with vascular calcification. METHODS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional study with 199 HD patients. Plain X-ray images of the lateral lumbar 
      spine from all subjects were studied to calculate semiquantitative vascular 
      calcification scores (VCS), as described by Kauppila. Commercially available enzyme 
      linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to quantify the serum 
      concentration of sRAGE and S100A12. RESULTS: The patients were 57.1 ± 13.7 years of 
      age; 54.3% were male, 49.2% were diabetic, and 36.2% had a history of cardiovascular 
      disease. In a univariate analysis, serum sRAGE was negatively associated with VCS 
      (log sRAGE, r=-0.208, P=0.003), whereas S100A12 showed a positive tendency (log 
      S100A12, r=0.235, P=0.085). Even after adjustments for confounding risk factors, 
      sRAGE was independently associated with VCS (β=-1.679, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrated that the circulating sRAGE level was inversely associated with 
      VCS in HD patients independent of the S100A12 level and the severity of systemic 
      inflammation.

TI  - Relationship between glucose exposure via peritoneal dialysis solutions and coronary

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is frequent in dialysis patients and is 
      associated with increased mortality. Impaired glucose metabolism is proposed as a 
      contributing factor for vascular calcification. We investigated whether glucose 
      exposure via dialysate may have a role in vascular calcification in non-diabetic 
      peritoneal dialysis patients. METHOD: We measured coronary artery calcification by 
      multi-slice computerized tomography in 50 prevalent non-diabetic peritoneal dialysis 
      patients and assessed its relations with fasting blood glucose, homeostasis model 
      assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and glucose exposure from peritoneal 
      dialysis fluid. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (48%) had no coronary calcification. 
      When patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of calcification, 
      patients with calcification were mostly men and had higher burden of cardiovascular 
      disease history, vitamin D dose intake, serum calcium, total glucose exposure from 
      dialysis solution, and lower total weekly Kt/Vurea. In multivariate analysis, 
      dialysate glucose exposure was an independent predictor of coronary artery 
      calcification score, besides serum calcium and Kt/Vurea. CONCLUSION: These data 
      suggest that high glucose exposure from dialysis solution, which is potentially 
      correctable, is a risk factor for vascular calcification in non-diabetic PD 
      patients.

TI  - Impact of Lanthanum Carbonate on Prognosis of Chronic Hemodialysis Patients: A 
      Retrospective Cohort Study (Kawashima Study).
PG  - 142-8
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12399 [doi]
AB  - In hemodialysis patients, mineral and bone disorder is an important risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease and subsequent death through the progression of vascular 
      calcification. Serum phosphorus plays a major role in this process. In the present 
      study, we retrospectively analyzed the effects of oral phosphate binder, lanthanum 
      carbonate (LC), on the mortality in hemodialysis patients. Among a total of 841 
      patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis on 1 July 2010, patients who were 
      treated with LC (LC group, N = 324) and those who were treated without LC (NLC 
      group, N = 517) were compared with respect to their all-cause mortality for a 
      long-term observation period of up to 36 months. The mortality rate was compared 
      using the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted by the propensity score. The 
      adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in the LC group versus NLC group was 0.515 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.328-0.807), suggesting that the use of LC is associated with 
      an almost 50% reduction in the mortality rate. The present retrospective study 
      including all hemodialysis patients demonstrated, for the first time, an association 
      between the use of LC and improved prognosis in hemodialysis patients. Randomized 
      controlled trials should be done in the future to validate our present findings.

TI  - Pulmonary vascular calcification in a nocturnal hemodialysis patient.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Although vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is common, 
      metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC) is an under-recognized complication of ESRD 
      with the majority of individuals being asymptomatic. Similar to calcification in 
      other arterial vascular beds, elevated serum calcium and phosphate appear to be 
      potent risk factors although the exact pathogenesis of MPC remains largely unclear. 
      Nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) is a form of renal replacement therapy that offers 
      superior control of serum phosphate and uremia compared to conventional (3 times 
      weekly) intermittent hemodialysis and shows promise in delaying the progression of 
      vascular calcification. Here, we report the first case of MPC involving the 
      pulmonary vasculature in a patient treated with nocturnal hemodialysis and discuss 
      the epidemiology, pathogenesis, histology and natural history of MPC.

TI  - [Calcific uremic arteriolopathy - treatment with sodium thiosulfate].
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy or calciphylaxis is a rare disorder characterized by 
      systemic medial calcification of arterioles that leads to ischemia and subcutaneous 
      necrosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease who are 
      on haemodialysis or who have received a renal transplant. Calciphylaxis is dangerous 
      by its fast progression into tissue necrosis, difficult healing process and a great 
      risk of secondary infection which is the most common cause of death in this 
      condition. The reported mortality rates are as high as 60-80 % in a couple of months 
      once it is diagnosed. The key to successful treatment of calciphylaxis is fast 
      diagnosing of the disease and appropriate treatment management. On the examples of 
      three patients from our haemodialysis centre we demonstrate typical clinical 
      manifestation of calciphylaxis and its treatment, which requires close 
      patient-medical staff cooperation. The basic principle of treatment of all our 
      patients was normalization of calcium-phosphate metabolism and secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism. Sodium thiosulfate had been administered to all patients at the 
      end of haemodialysis session. The wound care played another major role with gentle 
      debridement and intensive local care. After five to six months the skin defects 
      resolved in the first patient, partially resolved in the second patient and 
      deteriorated in the third patient. We have observed no side effects of sodium 
      thiosulfate application.

TI  - Mild and moderate pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease is associated with increased 
      coronary artery calcium.
PG  - 719-24
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S24536 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is increasingly evident that patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) are more likely to die from heart disease than kidney failure. This study 
      evaluated whether pre- dialysis CKD is an independent risk factor for coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC). METHODS: A total of 544 consecutive patients who underwent CAC 
      scoring were analyzed. Eleven patients requiring hemodialysis were excluded. 
      Patients were divided into three groups: normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
      (GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), mild CKD (90 ≥ GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and moderate CKD 
      (60 ≥ GFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Continuous and categorical variables were compared 
      using analysis of variance and the χ² statistic. A multiple logistic regression 
      model was used for detecting the association between total CAC score and GFR. An 
      unadjusted model was used, followed by a second model adjusted for covariates known 
      to be related to CAC. Another multivariable binary logistic model predicting the 
      presence of CAC (>10) was performed and odds of incidence of CAC (>10) were 
      calculated among the three GFR subgroups. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, 
      patients with mild CKD had mean CAC scores 175 points higher than those with the 
      referent normal GFR (P = 0.048), while those with moderate CKD had mean CAC scores 
      693 points higher than the referent (P < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, 
      patients with mild CKD were found to be 2.2 times more likely (95% confidence 
      interval 1.3-3.7, P = 0.004) and patients with moderate CKD were 6.4 times more 
      likely (95% confidence interval 2.9-14.3, P < 0.001) to have incident CAC compared 
      with the group with normal GFR. CONCLUSION: Mild and moderate pre-dialysis CKD are 
      independent risk factors for increased mean and incident CAC.

TI  - Serum Surfactant Protein D is Associated with Atherosclerosis of the Carotid Artery 
      in Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is an inflammatory modulator that has been 
      associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality, estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, and major adverse cardiac events in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between SP-D level and 
      atherosclerosis in patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: A total of 116 patients 
      undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were recruited to this cross-sectional study. As 
      a marker of atherosclerosis, the carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) was 
      measured by high-resolution ultrasonography, and the coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) score was determined by multislice computed tomography. Serum SP-D levels were 
      measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: In patients 
      on long-term hemodialysis, the mean serum SP-D level was 192.9 +/- 89.6 pg/mL 
      (range: 89-537 pg/mL). The serum SP-D level exhibited positive correlations with 
      CA-IMT (r = 0.497, p < 0.0001) and severe CAC (r = 0.352, p = 0.02), which persisted 
      after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The SP-D level showed positive 
      correlations with carotid CA-IMT and CAC in patients on long-term hemodialysis. 
      Therefore, SP-D may be a novel marker of atherosclerosis in patients with 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - Induction of intracellular heat-shock protein 72 prevents the development of 
      vascular smooth muscle cell calcification.
PG  - 524-32
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvs278 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant contributor to cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and coronary artery disease 
      (CAD). Osteo/chondrocytic transformation and simultaneous dedifferentiation of 
      smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in the pathogenesis of VC. Heat-shock 
      protein 72 (HSP72) is a cardioprotective inducible heat-shock protein that functions 
      as a molecular chaperone. However, its role in the development of accelerated 
      vascular dysfunction and calcification is largely unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      We describe for the first time marked reduction in HSP72 expression in arteries from 
      patients with CKD and CAD, compared with healthy controls, in vivo. Induction of 
      HSP72 by heat-shock treatment (HST) significantly prevented the development of 
      calcification of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HA-SMCs), in vitro. These 
      anti-calcific effects were abolished following treatment with both quercetin, an HST 
      inhibitor, and HSP72 siRNA knockdown. Induction of HSP72 suppressed Cbfa-1-dependent 
      osteo/chondrocytic transformation and stabilized SMC contractile phenotype through 
      the myocardin-serum response factor (SRF) pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation studies 
      demonstrated physical association between SRF and HSP72. Furthermore, organ culture 
      of arteries from CKD and CAD patients showed that these arteries retained their 
      ability to induce HSP72 following HST, despite initially reduced expression. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows for the first time that intracellular HSP72 may function 
      as a central regulator of molecular pathways involved in the development of VC. We 
      suggest treatment strategies that up-regulate HSP72 as a new approach to inhibit VC.

TI  - Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study 
      evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.
PG  - 263
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved 
      knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We 
      assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size 
      (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification 
      (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a 
      prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-four 
      dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included 
      in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC 
      score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels 
      (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the 
      multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. 
      RESULTS: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification 
      scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) 
      died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart 
      failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were 
      included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), 
      area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], 
      AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) 
      were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant 
      after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not 
      increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not 
      improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on 
      multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges 
      were based on 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on 
      chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis 
      patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac 
      size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve 
      prognostication in this population.

TI  - High prevalence of vertebral fractures assessed by quantitative morphometry in 
      hemodialysis patients, strongly associated with vascular calcifications.

AB  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) 
      and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional, 
      observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular 
      calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 ± 14.1 years, 63 % 
      males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests 
      included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and undercarboxylated), and total 
      matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for 
      the detection of VF, defined as reduction by ≥20 % of one of the vertebral body 
      dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. 
      Prevalence of VF was 55.3 % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control 
      group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; 
      OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and age (mean ± SD 66.7 ± 13.1 vs. 61.0 ± 14.7 years, 
      p < 0.001; OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The 
      prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in 
      controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association 
      with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 
      ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 
      1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion, 
      the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is high in 
      hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency is also 
      associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate 
      fractures in renal patients.

TI  - Loss of nighttime blood pressure dipping as a risk factor for coronary artery 
      calcification in nondialysis chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e7380
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000007380 [doi]
LID - e7380
AB  - Diurnal variations in blood pressure (BP) loss are closely associated with target 
      organ damage and cardiovascular events. The quantity of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) correlates with the atherosclerotic plaque burden, and an 
      increased quantity indicates a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular 
      events. This study investigated the nighttime diurnal variation in BP loss 
      associated with CAC in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Of the 1958 
      participants, we enrolled 722 participants with CKD without a history of acute 
      coronary syndrome or symptomatic coronary artery disease. CAC was measured with 
      computed tomography. BP was measured using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Central 
      BP was measured using a SphygmoCor waveform analysis system.Participants with CAC 
      had significantly higher 24-hour systolic, daytime systolic, and nighttime systolic 
      ambulatory BP and central systolic BP. The percentage of participants with dipping 
      loss was significantly higher among those with CAC. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that dipping loss and dipping ratio were independently associated 
      with CAC after adjusting for traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors and other BP parameters, including measurements of office-measured BP and 
      central BP. The dipping status improved risk prediction for CAC after considering 
      traditional risk factors and office-measured BP, using the net reclassification 
      improvement and integrated discrimination improvement.Nighttime loss of diurnal 
      variation in BP is an independent risk factor for CAC in CKD patients.

AB  - Parathyroidectomy (PTX) may cause low levels of PTH, leading to an excessive 
      reduction of bone turnover, which is associated with poor outcomes in dialysis 
      patients, including vascular calcification (VC). We aimed to prospectively 
      investigate the impact of PTX on bone remodeling and its potential consequence on 
      the progression of VC in hemodialysis patients. In this prospective study, 19 
      hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) were 
      evaluated. All patients underwent laboratorial tests and coronary tomography at 
      baseline and, 6 and 12 months after PTX; bone biopsy was performed at baseline and 
      12-month. At baseline, all patients had increased PTH levels up to 2500 pg/mL and 
      high turnover bone disease in their bone biopsies. Fourteen (74%) patients had VC. 
      During the follow-up, there was a significant decrease of PTH at 6 and 12-month. At 
      12-month, 90% of the patients evolved to low turnover bone disease. During the 
      period of the hungry bone syndrome (first 6 months), no change of coronary calcium 
      score was observed. However, calcium score increased significantly thereafter (12th 
      month). There was an association between VC progression and the severity of low 
      turnover bone disease. In conclusion, the shift from high to low turnover bone 
      disease after PTX occurs in parallel to VC progression, contributing to the 
      understanding of the complex pathophysiology involving mineral metabolism and 
      cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Nonthyroidal illness: a risk factor for coronary calcification and arterial 
      stiffness in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis?
PG  - 584-93
LID - 10.1111/joim.12107 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low triiodothyronine levels, as part of the nonthyroidal illness 
      syndrome, are common in dialysis patients and have repeatedly been shown to be 
      associated with increased (cardiovascular) mortality rates. We hypothesized that 
      increased vascular calcification may mediate this relationship. METHODS: A total of 
      84 patients from the Stockholm region receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis were 
      included in the study. Serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (fT3), 
      thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured. Coronary artery calcium 
      (CAC) scores were assessed by cardiac computed tomography scans. Surrogates of 
      arterial stiffness included aortic diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse 
      pressure, augmentation pressure and Buckberg's subendocardial viability ratio 
      measured by pulse waveform analyses. Patients were subsequently followed, and events 
      of death and censoring were recorded. Thyroid hormone concentrations were associated 
      with CAC scores, measures of arterial stiffness and all-cause mortality. The 
      associations between CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates and mortality were 
      also determined to evaluate a possible causal pathway. RESULTS: Both CAC scores and 
      arterial stiffness surrogates were substantially higher in individuals with low fT3 
      levels. These associations persisted in multivariate logistic and linear regression 
      analyses. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 32 (22-42) months, 24 
      patients died. Both fT3 levels below the median value [HR crude 4.1, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.4-12.6] and CAC scores above the median value (HR crude 5.8, 95% CI 
      1.7-20.1) were strongly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis, fT3 levels were strongly associated with arterial 
      stiffness, coronary artery calcification and mortality. We speculate that the 
      association between nonthyroidal illness and mortality may be partly mediated by 
      acceleration of vascular calcification.

TI  - Prognostic Utility of Calcium Scoring as an Adjunct to Stress Myocardial Perfusion

AB  - Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular 
      events in the general population. Recent data confirm the prognostic utility of 
      single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging in end-stage renal 
      disease, but whether performing CACS as part of hybrid imaging improves risk 
      prediction in this population is unclear. Consecutive patients (n = 284) were 
      identified after referral to a university hospital for cardiovascular risk 
      stratification in assessment for renal transplantation. Participants underwent 
      technetium-99m SPECT imaging after exercise or standard adenosine stress in those 
      unable to achieve 85% maximal heart rate; multislice CACS was also performed 
      (Siemens Symbia T16, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Subjects with known coronary 
      artery disease (n = 88) and those who underwent early revascularization (n = 2) were 
      excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of death or first myocardial 
      infarction. An abnormal SPECT perfusion result was seen in 22% (43 of 194) of 
      subjects, whereas 45% (87 of 194) had at least moderate CACS (>100 U). The frequency 
      of abnormal perfusion (summed stress score ≥4) increased with increasing CACS 
      severity (p = 0.049). There were a total of 15 events (8 deaths, and 7 myocardial 
      infarctions) after a median duration of 18 months (maximum follow-up 3.4 years). 
      Univariate analysis showed diabetes mellitus (Hazard ratio [HR] 3.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 
      9.54; p = 0.028), abnormal perfusion on SPECT (HR 5.32, 95% CI 1.84 to 15.35; p = 
      0.002), and moderate-to-severe CACS (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.11 to 11.35; p = 0.032) were 
      all associated with the primary outcome. In a multivariate model, abnormal perfusion 
      on SPECT (HR 4.18, 95% CI 1.43 to 12.27; p = 0.009), but not moderate-to-severe CACS 
      (HR 2.50, 95% CI 0.76 to 8.20; p = 0.130), independently predicted all-cause death 
      or myocardial infarction. The prognostic value of CACS was not incremental to 
      clinical and SPECT perfusion data (global chi-square change = 2.52, p = 0.112). In 
      conclusion, a perfusion defect on SPECT is an independent predictor of adverse 
      outcome in potential renal transplant candidates regardless of the CACS. The use of 
      CACS as an adjunct to SPECT perfusion data does not provide incremental prognostic 
      utility for the prediction of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in 
      end-stage renal disease.

TI  - C-reactive protein levels are associated with arterial media calcification in 
      nondiabetic patients with end-stage renal disease on long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 425-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VC) are associated with cardiovascular (CV) 
      morbidity and are independent predictors of CV mortality in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD). This study aimed to investigate the presence of arterial intima 
      calcification (AIC) and arterial media calcification (AMC) in nondiabetic patients 
      on long-term hemodialysis, and to assess the association with CV risk factors. 
      METHODS: 34 ESRD patients (17 males) on hemodialysis for at least 5 years were 
      evaluated for VC using B-mode ultrasonography. RESULTS: AMC and AIC patterns were 
      detected respectively in 62% and 59% of patients, and 21% had no VC. Patients with 
      AIC were significantly older than those without AIC (p < 0.001). CRP levels (p < 
      0.001) were higher in patients with AMC. Using multivariate logistic analysis of 
      regression, older age (> 50 years) and higher CRP levels (> 5 mg/l) were associated 
      with AIC and AMC, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003). Logistic regression 
      analysis showed that patients with CRP > 5 mg/l had a greater relative risk of 
      having AMC (odds ratio 30, 95% confidence interval 27.041 - 32.959; p = 0.003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can be used to detect AIC and AMC, and could be useful 
      for the early detection of VC. In nondiabetic patients who had been on hemodialysis 
      for at least 5 years, older age was associated with AIC, and elevated CRP levels 
      with AMC.

      peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 89-93
LID - 10.1159/000355859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and vascular calcifications (VC) in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 55 PD patients who 
      underwent pelvic X-ray to assess for VC. Patients with and without linear 
      calcifications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (27.3%) had linear 
      calcifications on pelvic X-ray. FGF-23 levels were higher in patients with VC (299.5 
      (30.4-2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8-1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic patients had lower 
      FGF-23 values (43.2 (14.9-134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8-2,410) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Patients 
      with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF-23 levels (70.6 (14.8-513) vs. 
      179.5 (30.4-2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not reach statistical 
      significance. FGF-23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis duration and HbA1c were 
      positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and ALP were negatively 
      associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF-23 levels, age, dialysis 
      duration and RRF to be associated with VC. CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 levels are associated 
      with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed to clarify whether it is simply a 
      marker or a potential factor. It may prove to be an important therapeutic target for 
      VC management.

TI  - High Parathyroid Hormone Level and Osteoporosis Predict Progression of Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Patients on Dialysis.
PG  - 2534-44
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2014070686 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery calcifications (CACs) are observed in most patients with CKD on 
      dialysis (CKD-5D). CACs frequently progress and are associated with increased risk 
      for cardiovascular events, the major cause of death in these patients. A link 
      between bone and vascular calcification has been shown. This prospective study was 
      designed to identify noninvasive tests for predicting CAC progression, including 
      measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and novel bone markers in adult patients 
      with CKD-5D. At baseline and after 1 year, patients underwent routine blood tests 
      and measurement of CAC, BMD, and novel serum bone markers. A total of 213 patients 
      received baseline measurements, of whom about 80% had measurable CAC and almost 50% 
      had CAC Agatston scores>400, conferring high risk for cardiovascular events. 
      Independent positive predictors of baseline CAC included coronary artery disease, 
      diabetes, dialysis vintage, fibroblast growth factor-23 concentration, and age, 
      whereas BMD of the spine measured by quantitative computed tomography was an inverse 
      predictor. Hypertension, HDL level, and smoking were not baseline predictors in 
      these patients. Three quarters of 122 patients completing the study had CAC 
      increases at 1 year. Independent risk factors for CAC progression were age, baseline 
      total or whole parathyroid hormone level greater than nine times the normal value, 
      and osteoporosis by t scores. Our results confirm a role for bone in CKD-associated 
      CAC prevalence and progression.

TI  - Association of Brachial-Ankle Pulse Wave Velocity and Cardiomegaly With Aortic Arch 
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - e3643
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003643 [doi]
LID - e3643
AB  - Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause 
      mortality in end-stage renal disease population. AoAC can be simply estimated with 
      an AoAC score using plain chest radiography. The objective of this study is to 
      evaluate the association of AoAC with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and 
      cardiomegaly in patients who have undergoing hemodialysis (HD).We retrospectively 
      determined AoAC and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) by chest x-ray in 220 HD patients who 
      underwent the measurement of baPWV. The values of baPWV were measured by an 
      ankle-brachial index-form device. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis was 
      used to identify the factors associated with AoAC score >4.Compared patients with 
      AoAC score ≦4, patients with AoAC score >4 had older age, higher prevalence of 
      diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, lower diastolic blood pressure, higher baPWV, 
      higher CTR, higher prevalence of CTR ≧50%, lower total cholesterol, and lower 
      creatinine level. After the multivariate stepwise logistic analysis, old age, 
      cerebrovascular disease, high baPWV (per 100 cm/s, odds ratio [OR] 1.065, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.003-1.129, P = 0.038), CTR (per 1%, OR 1.116, 95% CI 
      1.046-1.191, P = 0.001), and low total cholesterol level were independently 
      associated with AoAC score >4.Our study demonstrated AoAC severity was associated 
      with high baPWV and high CTR in patients with HD. Therefore, we suggest that 
      evaluating AoAC on plain chest radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method 
      for detecting arterial stiffness in HD patients.

TI  - Effects of low calcium dialysate on the progression of coronary artery calcification 
      in hemodialysis patients: An open-label 12-month randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between the dialysate calcium level and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) has not yet been evaluated in hemodialysis patients. The 
      objective of this study was to determine whether lowering the dialysate calcium 
      levels would decrease the progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      compared to using standard calcium dialysate. METHODS: We conducted an open-label 
      randomized trial with parallel groups. The patients were randomly assigned to either 
      12-month treatment with low calcium dialysate (LCD; 1.25mmol/L, n=36) or standard 
      calcium dialysate (SCD; 1.5mmol/L, n=40). The primary outcome was the change in the 
      CAC scores assessed by 64-slice multidetector computed tomography after 12months. 
      RESULTS: During the treatment period, CAC scores increased in both groups, 
      especially significant in LCD group (402.5±776.8, 580.5±1011.9, P=0.004). When we 
      defined progressors as patients at second and third tertiles of CAC changes, 
      progressor group had a higher proportion of LCD-treated patients than SCD-treated 
      patients (P=0.0229). In multivariate analysis, LCD treatment is a significant risk 
      factor for increase in CAC scores (odds ratio=5.720, 95% CI: 1.219-26.843, P=0.027). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of LCD may accelerate the progression of CAC in patients with 
      chronic hemodialysis over a 12-month period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Research

TI  - Sequence variation in vitamin K epoxide reductase gene is associated with survival 
      and progressive coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1591-6

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sequence variations in the gene(s) encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase 
      complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), the enzyme target of warfarin, have been associated with 
      increased cardiovascular disease in the general population. Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) is a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney 
      disease. We tested the hypothesis that the VKORC1 rs8050894 CC genotype would be 
      associated with mortality and progression of CAC ≤ 4 years. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 
      This study is an observational, prospective study of 167 individuals with stages 3 
      to 5 chronic kidney disease. Survival ≤ 4 years was assessed in all participants, 
      and CAC progression was measured in a subset of 86 patients. Participants with the 
      CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had higher baseline CAC scores (median score, 112 versus 
      299; P=0.036). Of those 86 patients who had a 4-year CAC score, those with the CG/GG 
      genotype had an increased risk of progressive CAC (adjusted for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension) compared with 
      those with the CC genotype. Four-year mortality risk was 4 times higher for 
      individuals with the CG/GG genotypes compared with individuals with the CC genotype 
      (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.5; P=0.02), adjusted for age, sex, 
      diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline CAC, and 
      hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had a higher 
      risk of CAC progression and a poorer survival. These data provide new perspectives 
      on the potential extrahepatic role of VKORC1 in individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease.

PG  - 610-4

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Recent epidemiological data have shown that abdominal fat 
      accumulation is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the association 
      between visceral adiposity and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. 
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 65 nondialyzed CKD male patients (59 ± 
      9 years, CKD stages 3 and 4). Abdominal fat compartments were assessed by computed 
      tomography (CT) at L4-L5 level. Visceral to subcutaneous (V/S) fat ratio was 
      calculated. Visceral obesity was defined as a V/S fat ratio greater than the median 
      value of the sample study (>0.55). CAC was detected by multi-slice CT. CAC scores 
      were calculated with the Agatston method. RESULTS: CAC was present (calcium score 
      >10 AU) in 66% of patients. In the group with visceral obesity, the CAC score was 
      significantly higher. This group had lower adiponectin and higher leptin levels 
      compared to patients without visceral obesity. In the whole sample, higher V/S fat 
      ratio was associated with CAC score, independently of age, body mass index, 
      diabetes, ionized calcium, smoking or renal function. CONCLUSION: Our results show 
      an association between visceral obesity and CAC in CKD patients, suggesting a 
      deleterious effect of visceral fat in these patients. Increased visceral adiposity 
      might enhance cardiovascular risk in this particular population.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and coronary artery calcification. We hypothesized that the osteogenic factor, 
      bone morphogenetic protein-4 (sBMP-4), is elevated in subjects with both CKD and 
      CAD. Serum was collected from 79 subjects undergoing diagnostic angiography and 
      stratified according to CAD and CKD status. Subjects with both CAD and CKD had 
      significantly elevated sBMP-4 compared to those with only one or no disease. sBMP-4 
      continued to be associated with the presence of both diseases after adjustment for 
      other risk factors. To determine if sBMP-4 is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification, we compared coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) to sBMP-4 in 22 
      subjects. A positive correlation between CAC and sBMP-4 was seen. In conclusion, 
      sBMP-4 is elevated in patients with both CAD and CKD and positively correlates with 
      CAC, suggesting a role for sBMP-4 in the increased CAD seen in CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is extremely high among kidney 
      transplant recipients (KTRs), particularly in the first months after 
      transplantation. Few data are available comparing the cardiovascular profile between 
      KTRs from living versus deceased donors. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the 
      present study was to evaluate the prevalence of CVD in the first 2 months following 
      transplantation, among 120 KTRs of living versus deceased donor organs. RESULTS: 
      Left ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 65% of patients, coronary artery 
      calcification in 30%, and cardiac arrhythmias in 46%. CVD was more prevalent among 
      KTRs from deceased versus living donors: ventricular hypertrophy 87% versus 59% (P = 
      .008); coronary artery calcification 42% versus 24% (P = .04); and cardiac 
      arrhythmias 59% versus 39% (P = .06). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted 
      for age and dialysis vintage, showed graft donor to not be associated with the 
      prevalence of any CVD (β coefficient 0.912, 95% confidence interval 0.276-3.012, P = 
      .88). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an elevated 
      prevalence of CVD among KTRs. Patient characteristics, mainly longer length on 
      dialysis seemed to contribute to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular 
      complications among KTRs from deceased compared with living donors on univariate but 
      not multivariate analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) can predict 
      cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in hemodialysis patients. However, little is known 
      about the predictive value of AAC for CV outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients without hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      prevalence and the predictive value of AAC in asymptomatic CKD patients. METHODS: We 
      prospectively evaluated 347 asymptomatic CKD patients without hemodialysis [median 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 43.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)]. A non-contrast 
      computed tomography scan was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) as a semi-quantitative measure of AAC. The patients were divided into 
      three groups according to the tertiles of ACI. RESULTS: Among the subjects, AAC was 
      found (ACI > 0) in 296 patients (86.3%), and the median ACI was 11.4%. During the 
      median follow-up of 41.5 months, a total of 33 CV events were observed. Patients 
      with the highest tertile of ACI had the highest risk of CV outcomes compared with 
      the other two groups (96.5%, 93.0%, and 74.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The Cox 
      proportional hazard models showed that ACI was an independent predictor of CV 
      outcomes (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.60, p < 0.001). The 
      C-index was also significantly increased by adding eGFR and ACI values to the model 
      along with the other conventional risk factors (0.79 versus 0.66, p = 0.043). 
      CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the AAC provides useful information for predicting adverse 
      clinical outcomes among asymptomatic CKD patients without hemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular disease and major extremity amputation are common in 
      patients with established renal failure and are associated with considerable 
      morbidity. Several studies have shown high rates of amputation following 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, but there is minimal literature on the 
      incidence of amputation following renal transplantation. Furthermore, there is 
      little evidence regarding the best method of predicting which patients might be at 
      risk of developing peripheral vascular complications after transplantation. METHODS: 
      We undertook a 5 year follow-up on the cohort of patients who were on our renal 
      transplant waiting list 5 years ago (January 2007). At this time, it was standard 
      practice within our unit for all patients to have routine pelvic x-rays to assess 
      for vascular calcification of the iliac vessels at the time of activation onto the 
      transplant waiting list. Any patients with moderate/severe calcification on x-ray, 
      which may complicate transplantation, were referred for computed tomography 
      angiogram (CTA) of their aorto-iliac vessels. Mortality, transplantation outcomes, 
      and amputation rates at 5 years were correlated with the severity of calcification 
      on preoperative imaging. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were on the 
      waiting list for renal transplantation in January 2007 (92 men; mean age, 58.3 +/- 
      6.2 years). Ninety-three patients received a transplant during the subsequent 5 
      years. By January 2012, 82 patients had a functioning transplant, 45 remained on the 
      waiting list (5 suspended), 40 patients had died, and 20 were alive but no longer on 
      the waiting list. Seventy-three (39.5%) had moderate or severe calcification on 
      plain x-ray and went on to have CTA. Of these patients, 16 (21.9%) had extensive 
      calcification affecting all the iliac vessels and were removed from the waiting list 
      as a result. Preoperative imaging was useful in determining the side for surgery in 
      a further 18 patients (24.3%). Twenty-two patients developed vascular complications. 
      Nineteen (86.4%) had moderate-severe vascular calcification on imaging. Four of the 
      patients with vascular complications (18.2%) underwent transplantation (2 had below 
      knee amputation (BKA) prior to transplantation; 1 developed distal ischemia on the 
      same side as the transplantation 2 years postoperatively; 1 had bilateral above knee 
      amputation (AKA) approximately 2 years after transplantation). Eleven (50%) of the 
      patients with vascular complications were dead at 5 years of follow-up. Mortality 
      and amputation rates were higher in patients with moderate-severe calcification than 
      minimal calcification (30.1% vs 16.6%; P = .02 and 10.9% vs 1.8%; P = .003, 
      respectively). There was no difference in rates of delayed graft function (DGF), 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), or creatinine at 1 year between patients who 
      underwent transplantation with moderate-severe calcification and those without, 
      however, intraoperative vascular complications (26.7% vs 3%; P < .001), graft loss 
      (28.1% vs 3.4%; P = .01), and death with a functioning transplant (9.7% vs 1.6%; P = 
      .04) rates were higher in patients with extensive calcification compared with those 
      without. CONCLUSIONS: Plain x-ray of the pelvis is a useful screening tool to 
      identify those patients who may require further detailed vascular imaging prior to 
      transplantation. Amputation rates following renal transplantation are low and 
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in isolation should not preclude transplantation. 
      Nevertheless, significant vascular calcification is predictive of mortality both 
      with and without transplantation and graft loss in patients with a renal transplant.

TI  - Endogenous soluble receptor of advanced glycation end-products (esRAGE) is 
      negatively associated with vascular calcification in non-diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1193-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0007-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulate in CKD and may 
      predispose to cardiovascular disease by inducing inflammatory and oxidant stress in 
      the vascular endothelium. Soluble forms of the receptor for AGE (RAGE) may be 
      protective against these effects by binding AGE in the soluble phase. Accumulating 
      evidence suggests a protective role of soluble RAGE against vascular calcification. 
      This study investigates the association between endogenous soluble RAGE (esRAGE) and 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We studied 65 non-diabetic 
      hemodialysis patients, on 3 × 4 h dialysis schedule, and 19 controls. Serum levels 
      of esRAGE, hsCRP, parathormone, lipids, calcium, and phosphorus were measured. 
      Aortic calcification index (ACI) was measured using non-contrast CT of the abdominal 
      aorta. RESULTS: Aortic calcification was detected in 64 out of 65 hemodialysis 
      patients. Levels of esRAGE were lower in hemodialysis patients (278 pg/ml, SD 101.1) 
      than in controls (443 ± 109 pg/ml; P = 0.001). ACI correlated negatively in stepwise 
      multivariate analysis with esRAGE (P = 0.002) and positively with hsCRP (<0.0001), 
      systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001) and dialysis vintage (P = 0.05); R (2) = 0.65. 
      CONCLUSION: Levels of esRAGE were low among hemodialysis patients and correlated 
      negatively with ACI.

AB  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is thought to be implicated in the development of 
      arterial stiffness and vascular calcification. As a Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor, 
      it is interesting to investigate whether sclerostin or dickkopf-1 (DKK1) level is 
      correlated with arterial stiffness in renal transplant (RT) recipients. Fasting 
      blood samples were obtained for biochemical data, sclerostin, DKK1, and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) determinations. In this study, we applied automatic pulse wave 
      analyzer (VaSera VS-1000) to measure brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and either 
      sides of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity value, which greater than 14.0 m/s was 
      determined as high arterial stiffness. Among 68 RT recipients, 30 patients (44.1%) 
      were in the high arterial stiffness group. Compared with patients in the low 
      arterial stiffness group, patients in the high arterial stiffness group had higher 
      prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.002), diabetes (P < 0.001), metabolic syndrome 
      (P = 0.025), longer posttransplant duration (P = 0.005), higher systolic blood 
      pressure (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.018), and higher fasting 
      glucose (P = 0.004), total cholesterol (P = 0.042), blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.020), 
      phosphorus (P = 0.042), and sclerostin levels (P = 0.001). According to our 
      multivariable forward stepwise linear regression analysis, age (β = 0.272, 
      P = 0.014), phosphorus (β = 0.308, P = 0.007), and logarithmically-transformed OPG 
      (log-OPG; β = 0.222, P = 0.046) were positively associated with sclerostin levels, 
      and multivariate logistic regression analysis, sclerostin (odds ratio 1.052, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.007-1.099, P = 0.024), and posttransplant duration (odds ratio 
      1.024, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.045, P = 0.019) were the independent 
      predictors of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients. In this study, serum 
      sclerostin level, but not DKK1, was proved to be involved in the pathogenetic 
      process of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients.

PG  - 531-5

AB  - Accelerated vascular calcification is a well-described complication of chronic 
      kidney disease often affecting large and small vessels alike through a variety of 
      mechanisms. Accordingly, dysregulation of calcium and phosphate balance, vitamin D 
      metabolism, hyperparathyroidism, and endothelial injury can lead to both 
      macrovascular and microvascular complications. We describe a 56-year-old Hispanic 
      male with a history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and 
      medical noncompliance who developed sequential digital ischemia and necrosis 
      involving both hands as well as right foot as a result of Mönckeberg sclerosis. An 
      extensive metabolic and serologic workup was unrevealing but radiographic studies 
      and histopathology revealed the diagnosis. A multifaceted approach was instituted 
      including wound debridement and amputations along with intensive medical support. In 
      addition to improving hypertensive control and striving for improved calcium and 
      phosphate balance, sodium thiosulfate solution was administered for more than 1 
      year. This aggressive approach allowed his wounds to heal and has arrested further 
      digital ischemia from occurring.

TI  - Increased levels of serum parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 are 
      the main factors associated with the progression of vascular calcification in 
      long-hour hemodialysis patients.
PG  - c132-8
LID - 10.1159/000334424 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the frequency and factors associated with 
      the progression of vascular calcifications (VCs) using a semiquantitative X-ray 
      score. We included all prevalent hemodialysis patients with initial radiological 
      scores ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity of the VCs. Patients were 
      classified as non-progressors or progressors after 3 years. Among the 85 patients, 
      44.7% were classified as progressors. Only exhibiting high levels of serum intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH, >190 pg/ml) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 levels 
      (>3,000 RU/ml) is associated with the risk of VC progression (OR 5.8, 95% CI 
      1.7-19.8, p = 0.004). Calcitriol analogs (38%), cinacalcet (15%), dialysate calcium 
      (mean 1.48 mmol/l), dialysis session time (4-8 h) and calcium- (10%) and 
      non-calcium-based phosphate binders (38%) were prescribed on an individual basis. 
      Hyperphosphatemia (<10%) and, especially, hypercalcemia (1%) and hyperparathyroidism 
      (>585 pg/ml = 0%) were infrequently observed. In conclusion, the main factor 
      associated with VC progression was the association of higher serum PTH and FGF-23 
      levels. It remains to be seen whether patients should be treated to lower their PTH 
      value, even within the target range, using calcitriol analogs, calcimimetics, 
      parathyroidectomy, or by modifying the Klotho-FGF-23 axis.

TI  - Polymorphism in the human matrix Gla protein gene is associated with the progression 
      of vascular calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 882-9
LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0785-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is one of the important proteins inhibiting 
      vascular calcification (VC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the 
      promoter and coding regions of the MGP gene affect the transcriptional activity. In 
      this study, we investigated the relationship between the SNPs and progression of VC 
      in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of 134 MHD patients whose VC could be 
      followed by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) examinations. MGP-SNPs 
      (T-138C, rs1800802 and G-7A, rs1800801) were determined. The progression speed of VC 
      was examined by plotting the abdominal aortic calcium volume scores. RESULTS: The 
      progression speed of VC of patients with the CC genotype of T-138C was significantly 
      slower than that of patients with the CT or TT genotype. Multiple regression 
      analysis showed that CT/TT genotype, greater age at the beginning of MHD, male sex, 
      high levels of calcium × phosphate, low levels of high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of 
      ferritin and non-use of angiotensin II receptor blockers were significantly 
      associated with progression of VC. CONCLUSIONS: The MGP-138CC genotype may be 
      associated with slower progression of VC in MHD patients. The genotype of the MGP 
      gene will be a genomic biomarker that is predictive of VC progression.

TI  - Associations of atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta on CTA with 
      arterial stiffness and chronic kidney disease in asymptomatic patients with diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 1151-9

AB  - The relation between atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aortic (DTA), 
      arterial stiffness and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) remains unclear. The current aim was to evaluate associations of DTA 
      atherosclerosis with arterial stiffness and parameters of CKD in asymptomatic 
      patients with DM. A total of 213 asymptomatic patients with diabetes (mean age 52 
      years, 56% men) underwent cardiovascular risk assessment including multi-slice 
      computed tomography (for non-invasive coronary angiography, from which DTA 
      atherosclerosis can be derived), non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness with 
      applanation tonometry and assessment of renal function. Measurements of DTA 
      atherosclerosis included assessment of DTA thickening and calcium score. Arterial 
      stiffness was determined by the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), 
      parameters of CKD included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary 
      albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR). DTA atherosclerosis was present in 180 (84%) 
      patients. Patients with DTA atherosclerosis had increased arterial stiffness, lower 
      eGFR and higher UACR values. After multivariate correction, DTA calcium score was 
      independently associated with PWV (β = 0.18, p = 0.04). Furthermore, both DTA 
      maximal wall thickness and DTA calcium score were independently associated with eGFR 
      (β = -7.37, p < 0.001 and β = -1.99, p < 0.003, respectively), but not with UACR. 
      The increase in arterial stiffness by atherosclerosis seemed to be mediated by 
      arterial calcification, while the DTA calcium score was independently associated 
      with arterial stiffness, but not DTA maximal wall thickness. Furthermore, parameters 
      of CKD in patients with DM had a distinct relationship with DTA atherosclerosis: DTA 
      atherosclerosis was associated with eGFR but not with UACR.

TI  - Sirolimus eluting coronary stent implantation in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis: the OUCH study (outcome of cypher stent inhemodialysis patients).
PG  - 1856-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pivotal studies on drug-eluting stents have excluded hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. No quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis has been reported. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: The OUtcome of Cypher stent in Hemodialysis patients (OUCH) 
      Study is a prospective non-randomized single-arm registry designed to assess the 
      results of sirolimus-eluting stents in HD patients, with follow-up QCA in an 
      independent core laboratory. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of 
      target-vessel failure (TVF) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), 
      and target-vessel revascularization (TVR) at 1 year. A total of 117 patients were 
      enrolled. The TVF rate was 24.9% (2.6% cardiac death, 1.4% MI, 23.9% TVR), and stent 
      thrombosis was documented in 1 patient (0.9%). Coronary calcification was a 
      predictor of TVF. Late lumen loss (LLL) averaged 0.69±0.93mm. The histogram of LLL 
      showed that a total of 76% of lesions were distributed the same normally as that in 
      normal renal function (average LLL 0.20±0.29mm), but 24% of lesions were outliers 
      (average LLL 2.07±0.62mm). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes different clinical and 
      QCA results in HD patients as higher TVF rate, different predictive factors, and 
      different histogram of LLL compared with normal renal function. The different 
      histogram of LLL was the existence of many outliers with the same average and the 
      same deviation, suggesting the loss of sirolimus had an effect on a significant 
      number of HD patients.

TI  - Histopathological changes of radial artery wall in patients of chronic kidney 
      disease stage 5 undergoing AV fistula formation and their correlation with serum 
      iPTH levels.
PG  - 884-9
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.164562 [doi]
AB  - Vascular complications arise in uremic patients in the absence of clinically 
      significant atherosclerotic disease. Elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
      abnormal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) balance have been implicated in vascular 
      damage in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, but there is lack of 
      histo-pathological studies. Patients with CKD stage 5 and 5D who underwent 
      arterio-venous fistula were included in this study. Baseline and laboratory 
      parameters including assessment of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, albumin, 
      calcium, phosphorus, intact PTH (iPTH) and vitamin D level were documented. The 
      specimens of the arterial wall were obtained during the procedure and were analyzed. 
      Patients were divided into two groups iPTH <400 (Group A) and iPTH >400 (Group B). 
      Mean intimal thickness (IT) was significantly high in patients of Group B (60.4 ± 
      24.1 μ m) as compared with patients of Group A (37.8 ± 14.9 μm) (P = 0.003). 
      Vascular calcification was comparable in both groups. The iPTH level was found to be 
      an independent risk factor for high intima thickness (correlation coefficient 0.653) 
      (P-value <0.01). Patients with high (≥ 400 pg/mL) iPTH have 8.93 times the risk of 
      developing intimal thickness of ≥ 60 μ m as compared with patients with low (<400 
      pg/mL) iPTH (P-value <0.05), with 95% confidence interval of 1.27, 62.61. The mean 
      IT of the radial artery significantly correlated with the iPTH level, while vascular 
      calcification was independent of the iPTH level. Hyperparathyroidism is an important 
      cause of ongoing vascular damage and may contribute to higher vascular events in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Does cinacalcet HCl, an oral calcimimetic agent for the treatment of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, improve arterial stiffness in patients on continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis?
PG  - 134-9
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to 
      cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, VC and AS are correlated. 
      Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to the progression of VC 
      and to increases in AS. The efficacy of cinacalcet (CIN) in reducing AS in patients 
      on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has not been determined. The 
      present study enrolled 19 CAPD patients (12 women, 7 men; mean age: 62.2 +/- 3.6 
      years) with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater than 500 ng/dL (mean 
      value: 675 +/- 106 ng/dL) in whom daily oral treatment with CIN 25 mg was started. 
      If administration of CIN for 3 months failed to reduce the level of iPTH to less 
      than 300 ng/dL, the dose of CIN was increased to 50 mg daily. Before the start of 
      CIN and at 3 years after the start of CIN, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined. 
      In 11 patients, levels of iPTH were reduced to less than 300 ng/dL; levels in the 
      rest of the patients remained high. We observed no significant differences in PWV 
      before CIN and at 3 years after CIN start (1856 +/- 198 cm/s vs. 1726 +/- 187 cm/s). 
      Multivariate regression analysis of PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood 
      pressure and changes in serum levels of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV In 
      patients receiving CAPD, VC and AS might be the result of higher systolic blood 
      pressure and increased serum levels of phosphate.

TI  - Effects of Lowering Dialysate Calcium Concentration on Mineral and Bone Disorders in 
      Chronic Hemodialysis Patients: Conversion from 3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12329 [doi]
AB  - Selection of a lower dialysate calcium concentration (DCa) can reduce calcium burden 
      and prevent vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. However, decreased DCa 
      can worsen mineral and bone disorders. This 1-year retrospective observational study 
      evaluated 121 hemodialysis patients at Fukuoka Renal Clinic who underwent conversion 
      of DCa from 3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L. The primary outcomes were changes in serum 
      levels of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The effects of baseline 
      serum calcium and PTH levels on changes in biochemical parameters were also 
      determined. One year after DCa conversion, mean serum calcium level decreased, while 
      serum phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH concentrations increased. The rate of 
      achievement of target PTH was higher in patients with lower serum PTH level at 
      baseline, while patients with higher baseline serum PTH level tended to exceed the 
      upper limit of the PTH target range. Patients with higher baseline serum calcium 
      concentration showed a greater decrease in serum calcium level and a greater 
      increase in serum PTH level at 1 year. Patients with a lower baseline serum PTH 
      level can benefit from optimal PTH control following conversion of DCa from 
      3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L. However, secondary hyperparathyroidism may be exacerbated 
      in some patients with higher baseline serum calcium (Ca) and PTH levels. These 
      results indicate that an individualized approach can maximize the benefits of Ca 
      unloading after conversion to lower DCa.

AB  - Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with advanced chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) is challenging due to frequent presence of complex calcified lesions 
      and the very high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We report a strategy 
      of "zero contrast" PCI, guided by intravascular imaging and physiology, performed in 
      three patients with advanced CKD in whom severe calcification necessitated 
      rotational atherectomy (RA) to facilitate and optimize PCI. This approach resulted 
      in safe and successful PCI while preserving renal function. © 2017 Wiley

TI  - Impact of non-invasive cardiovascular screening programs as a predictor of 
      cardiovascular events among asymptomatic chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 416-24
LID - 10.1007/s10157-015-1169-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical usefulness of physiological and radiological examinations 
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification has not been fully demonstrated 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In the present study, predictive values of 
      CVD were investigated among asymptomatic CKD patients by comprehensive and 
      non-invasive CVD screening programs. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 139 
      asymptomatic CKD patients. All patients were examined by comprehensive and 
      non-invasive CVD risk screening programs that included carotid ultrasonography, 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS), pulse wave velocity, and flow-mediated 
      vasodilation, and their associations with major adverse cardiovascular events 
      (MACEs) were analyzed. RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 32.3 months, 13 MACEs 
      were observed. Among all CVD screening examinations, severity of the carotid plaque 
      score (PS) and CACS was significantly higher in the MACE group than in the MACE-free 
      group (11.3 ± 5.8 versus 6.1 ± 5.3, P = 0.001 and 657 versus 74, P = 0.020, 
      respectively). Kaplan-Meier curves for the incidences of MACEs classified according 
      to the combination of carotid PS and CACS showed that severe carotid PS and severe 
      CACS groups had the highest event rate in comparison with the groups without any of 
      these (29.9, 11.9, and 3.6 %, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      long-term follow-up analysis, the combination of carotid atherosclerosis and CACS 
      was a useful and non-invasive screening tool for predicting cardiovascular events 
      among asymptomatic CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Diastolic dysfunction is frequently associated with left ventricular 
      hypertrophy, which is indicative of future cardiovascular events. Vascular 
      calcification (VC) is known to be associated with coronary artery disease in 
      dialysis patients. The present study was to determine the interrelationship between 
      LV diastolic dysfunction by tissue Doppler imaging and VC on plain radiographs in 
      dialysis patients. METHODS: Fifty-six dialysis patients were recruited and VC scores 
      were evaluated by plain radiographic film. The ratio of early diastolic transmitral 
      inflow velocity (E) to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E') was measured by 
      tissue Doppler imaging. We defined diastolic dysfunction as an E/E' ratio >15 on 
      tissue Doppler imaging. RESULTS: Patients with diastolic dysfunction showed a higher 
      percentage of coronary artery disease history, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      scores ≥5, high LV mass index, and high left atrium volume compared to patients 
      without diastolic dysfunction. The E/E' ratio was significantly higher in patients 
      with significant VC, VC scores of the pelvis and hands ≥3, and AAC scores ≥5 on 
      plain radiographs. AAC scores ≥5 were considered an independent predictor of 
      diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: VC on plain radiographs is associated with the 
      E/E' ratio and AAC scores ≥5 are important clues for LV diastolic dysfunction in 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - A decreased level of serum soluble Klotho is an independent biomarker associated 
      with arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e56695
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056695 [doi]
LID - e56695
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klotho was originally identified in a mutant mouse strain unable to 
      express the gene that consequently showed shortened life spans. In humans, low serum 
      Klotho levels are related to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in 
      community-dwelling adults. However, it is unclear whether the serum Klotho levels 
      are associated with signs of vascular dysfunction such as arterial stiffness, a 
      major determinant of prognosis, in human subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      METHODS: We determined the levels of serum soluble Klotho in 114 patients with CKD 
      using ELISA and investigated the relationship between the level of Klotho and 
      markers of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and various types of vascular 
      dysfunction, including flow-mediated dilatation, a marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction, ankle-brachial pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a marker of arterial 
      stiffness, intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of atherosclerosis, and the aortic 
      calcification index (ACI), a marker of vascular calcification. RESULTS: The serum 
      Klotho level significantly correlated with the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and 
      inversely correlated with the parathyroid hormone level and the fractional excretion 
      of phosphate. There were significant decreases in serum Klotho in patients with 
      arterial stiffness defined as baPWV≥1400 cm/sec, atherosclerosis defined as maximum 
      IMT≥1.1 mm and vascular calcification scores of ACI>0%. The serum Klotho level was a 
      significant determinant of arterial stiffness, but not endothelial dysfunction, 
      atherosclerosis or vascular calcification, in the multivariate analysis in either 
      metabolic model, the CKD model or the CKD-MBD model. The adjusted odds ratio of 
      serum Klotho for the baPWV was 0.60 (p = 0.0075). CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in the 
      serum soluble Klotho levels are independently associated with signs of vascular 
      dysfunction such as arterial stiffness in patients with CKD. Further research 
      exploring whether therapeutic approaches to maintain or elevate the Klotho level 
      could improve arterial stiffness in CKD patients is warranted.

      noncalcium n = 165]). Adjusted risk in the calcium group for death and target lesion 
      revascularization was significant in the non-HD stratum (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.52, p <0.0001, and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.36, p 
      = 0.003) and the HD stratum (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.86, p = 0.02, and HR 2.25, 95% 
      CI 1.51 to 3.36, p <0.0001). Risk for definite stent thrombosis tended to be higher 
      in the calcium group in the HD stratum (HR 5.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 38.9, p = 0.12) but 
      not in then non-HD stratum (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.67, p = 0.41). The use of 
      rotational atherectomy in patients with severe calcification did not have a 
      significant impact on the cumulative incidence of target lesion revascularization in 
      the non-HD stratum (17.7% [n = 268] with vs 18.2% [n = 588] without rotational 
      atherectomy, p = 0.68) and the HD stratum (54.7% [n = 115] with vs 51.9% [n = 118] 
      without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.19). In conclusion, regardless of HD status, 
      patients with calcified lesions have increased long-term risk for death and target 
      lesion revascularization after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of magnesium (Mg) on the 
      evolution of arterial calcifications in hemodialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Seventy-two stable hemodialysis patients were randomly allocated to two groups: 36 
      administered a regimen containing magnesium carbonate plus calcium acetate as a 
      phosphate binder (Mg group), while the rest 36 received calcium acetate alone (Ca 
      group). The presence and the progression of arterial calcifications were evaluated 
      in plain X-rays using a simple vascular calcification score. The duration of the 
      follow-up period was 12 months. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients of the Mg group and 27 
      of the Ca group completed the study. The mean time average values of the biochemical 
      laboratories did not differ between the two groups, except serum Mg: 2.83 + 0.38 in 
      the Mg group versus 2.52 + 0.27 mg/dl in the Ca group, p = 0.001. In 9/32 (28.12 %) 
      patients of the Mg group and in 12/27 (44.44 %) patients of the Ca group, the 
      arterial calcifications were worsened, p = 0.276. Moreover, in 4/32 (15.6 %) 
      patients of the Mg group and in 0/27 (0 %) patients of the Ca group, they were 
      improved, p = 0.040. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      serum magnesium was an independent predictor for no progression of the arterial 
      calcifications, p = 0.047. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium probably retards the arterial 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients. Further clinical studies are needed to 
      clarify whether magnesium provides cardiovascular protection to this group of 
      patients.

TI  - Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and 
      proinflammatory ligand for RAGE (EN-RAGE) are associated with carotid 
      atherosclerosis in patients with peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 208-14
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.07.115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) exerts 
      a protective effect on the development of atherosclerotic vascular complications by 
      inhibiting RAGE-mediated inflammatory response. In contrast, extracellular newly 
      identified RAGE-binding protein (EN-RAGE) contributes to increased atherosclerosis 
      as a pro-inflammatory ligand for RAGE. We determined the levels of sRAGE and EN-RAGE 
      in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and evaluated their relationship with carotid 
      atherosclerosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 91 PD patients 
      and 29 control subjects. Carotid IMT (cIMT) and abdominal aortic vascular 
      calcification score (VCS) were evaluated using high-resolution B-mode 
      ultrasonography and plain radiographic film of the lateral abdomen. RESULTS: Plasma 
      sRAGE and EN-RAGE levels were more than twice as higher in PD patients compared to 
      controls. EN-RAGE showed a strong positive correlation with serum high-sensitivity 
      CRP (p=0.007) and IL-6 (p=0.002), whereas sRAGE was negatively associated with those 
      inflammatory markers (p=0.001, p=0.031). Even after adjustments for traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, both sRAGE and EN-RAGE were independently associated 
      with cIMT (β=-0.230, p=0.037, β=0.155, p=0.045) and VCS (β=-0.205, p=0.049, β=0.197, 
      p=0.156). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that old age (OR 1.14, 95% CI 
      1.03-1.25, p=0.009), presence of diabetes (OR 13.4, 95% CI: 1.20-150.18, p=0.035) 
      and elevated plasma EN-RAGE (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.05-5.11, p=0.048) were significant 
      predictors for the occurrence of carotid atherosclerosis (cIMT>1.0mm and/or plaque 
      formation). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that elevated plasma EN-RAGE and 
      decreased sRAGE level could play a crucial role in systemic inflammation and carotid 
      atherosclerosis in PD patients.

TI  - Calciphylaxis responsive to lanthanum carbonate (FOSRENOL) therapy.
PG  - 335-8
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare and debilitating vasculopathy predominantly seen in patients 
      with renal failure. The proposed mechanism of injury is active vascular 
      calcification with associated elevated parathyroid hormone, hypercalcemia, or 
      hyperphosphatemia. With improved pharmacologic agents including non-calcium 
      containing phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics, and 
      bisphosphonates, targeted therapy on the mineralization process has been tried with 
      varied success. We report a case of biopsy-proven calciphylaxis in a patient with 
      acute kidney injury requiring dialysis that had persistently elevated 
      calcium-phosphorus product refractory to treatment. The patient, however, responded 
      rapidly to the initiation of lanthanum carbonate therapy and modified dialysis. This 
      is the first known case reported in the literature utilizing this new 
      non-calcium-based phosphate binder in the setting of calciphylaxis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between arterial 
      microcalcification (AMiC) and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) 
      hyporesponsiveness in hemodialysis patients. The presence of AMiC was confirmed by 
      pathologic examination of von Kossa-stained arterial specimens acquired during 
      vascular access surgery. We assessed the ESA hyporesponsiveness index (EHRI), 
      defined as the weekly ESA dose per kilogram body weight divided by the hemoglobin 
      level. AMiC was detected in 33 (40.2%) of 82 patients. Patients with diabetes had a 
      higher incidence of AMiC than patients without diabetes. The serum levels of albumin 
      and cholesterol were higher in patients without AMiC than in patients with AMiC. The 
      serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone were lower in patients with AMiC than in 
      patients without AMiC. The serum levels of phosphate and calcium-phosphorus product 
      did not differ between the two groups. The mean EHRI value was higher in patients 
      with AMiC than in patients without AMiC. In multivariate analyses, ESA 
      hyporesponsiveness and diabetes showed a significant association with AMiC. In 
      conclusion, ESA hyporesponsiveness may be a clinical relevant parameters related to 
      AMiC in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy ameliorated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in 
      high-altitude area.
PG  - 1139-41
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2014.917672 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), previously called calciphylaxis, 
      is a devastating complication of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with an annual 
      incidence of 1-4% in dialysis patients and the mortality is as high as 80%. The 
      rarity of the disease and the multifactorial nature of its causes have compromised 
      good evidences that could determine the best therapy for the condition. For 
      inhabitants in high-altitude area, the content of oxygen in the air is significantly 
      lower than that in sea level area, which leads to the differences in the clinical 
      manifestations and treatments to CUA. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a patient with 
      CUA on Tibetan Plateau successfully treated by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). This 
      46-year-old uremic Tibetan peasant received hemodialysis for 10 years, and over the 
      last six months, skin necrosis occurred progressively on the distal joint of the 
      middle finger of his right hand and the distal knuckles became paled, hardened, and 
      severely painful. Extensive calcification of the arteries of both hands was revealed 
      and his serum phosphorus elevated and serum calcium decreased. After diagnosis of 
      CUA, patient was treated with HBO therapy for successive three weeks with a session 
      per day, on the basis of secondary infection prevention. Pain of the affected finger 
      was quickly alleviated in one week and the lesions of the affected finger healed in 
      two months. CONCLUSION: As the dialysis population in high-altitude area increasing 
      rapidly in recent years, this management strategy of improving focal oxygen supply 
      by HBO might act as a reference for the treatment of CUA patients in similar 
      conditions.

TI  - Trends of elevated parathormone serum titers in hemodialysis patients on intensive 
      therapy for bone disease: a multicenter study.
PG  - 1166-77
AB  - To determine the prevalence of controlled parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum levels 
      with intensified therapy for chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD) in the dialysis population, we studied 563 chronic hemodialysis patients 
      recruited from three different dialysis centers from three different major cities in 
      the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The trend of the routine monthly chemistries related to 
      CKD-MBD was evaluated besides the whole-molecule PTH serum levels over 28 months 
      (January 2011 to April 2013). The cost ratios of the medications to the estimated 
      dialysis total cost were calculated. There were 323 (57.4%) males in the study, and 
      the mean age of the patients was 50.2±15.2 years; 371 (65.9%) patients were 
      initiated on dialysis before 2011. The causes of the original kidney disease 
      included diabetes mellitus in 163 (29%) patients. Parathyroidectomy was performed in 
      23 (4.1%) patients and only six (23%) patients underwent the operation during the 
      study period; most of the parathyroidectomies (69%) were performed before 2011. The 
      trend of the medians of monthly serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, albumin, 
      bicarbonate, alkaline phosphatase, serum levels of PTH and vitamin D25 assays showed 
      better control of the levels with time. The added cost of cinacalcet was more 
      significant than the other drugs, including vitamin D and phosphate binders, but the 
      cost was minimal in comparison with the whole dialysis bill. The ratios of the 
      discontinuation rates to the total patient-months of treatment for the different 
      drugs were in the range of 3-4% and mostly due to transient overdosing of 
      medications. We conclude that the trends of the median serum levels of PTH and 
      related minerals in the CKD patients in our dialysis patients suggested a good 
      inclination toward control and prevention of the vascular calcifications prevalent 
      in the CKD-MBD. The popularity of use of new drugs such as cinacalcet is promising 
      and does not seem to add much to the current out-patient cost of chronic dialysis.

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently 
      related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated 
      the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis 
      dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional 
      analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without 
      manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% 
      hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal 
      visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF 
      as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate 
      logistic regression. CAC (calcium score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those 
      presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male 
      gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference 
      (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 
      85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the 
      multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left 
      ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the 
      presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained 
      associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is 
      independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

AB  - In the chronic dialysis program, taking into consideration the duration of the 
      dialysis, we sought in 25 patients (average age 34 years) for the radiological signs 
      of the uraemic osteopathy, of the ectosteal calcification and the vascular 
      calcification of the type Mönkeberg. In our patients a radiologically visible 
      affection was to be proved at a duration of the dialysis of more than 3 months. Size 
      and kind of the alterations depended on the age of the patients. In patients younger 
      than 40 years we established an accumulation of isolated soft tissue or osseous 
      processes, in patients older than 40 years the combination of multilocular osseous 
      changes with calcification of the soft tissue or vascular calcium was of interest. 
      Calcifications of the vessels of type Mönkeberg we could not find in patients 
      younger than 40 years also at a duration of the dialysis of more than 1 year. This 
      work shall be starting point of further observations on patients with chronic renal 
      insufficiency during the course of dialysis, especially after changing of the 
      calcium content of the dialysis solution.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification evaluated on chest X-ray is a strong independent predictor 
      of cardiovascular events in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 135-42
LID - 10.1007/s00380-011-0129-1 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. Some reports have previously shown that simple assessment of aortic 
      calcification using plain radiography is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events; 
      however, these studies simply assessed whether aortic calcification was present or 
      absent only, without considering its extent. Here, we evaluated the validity of 
      grading aortic arch calcification (AoAC) to predict new CV events. We 
      retrospectively reviewed chest X-rays in 212 asymptomatic HD patients who underwent 
      measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 2006 without a past history of CV 
      events. The extent of AoAC was divided into four grades (0-3). Among these subjects, 
      the follow-up of CV events in 197 patients was completed. At baseline, AoAC grade 
      was positively associated with age, dialysis vintage, PWV and parathyroid hormone 
      levels, and negatively correlated with body weight and body mass index. Arterial 
      stiffness, as determined by PWV, was also correlated with increasing AoAC grade. 
      Eighty-nine CV events in total occurred during a mean follow-up period of 
      69 ± 45 months. With multivariate adjustment, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 
      incidence was significantly higher in patients with higher AoAC grade (grades 2 and 
      3) than in those with grade 0 or 1 (p = 0.013, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox 
      proportional hazards analyses showed the predictive values of AoAC grade were 
      significant (hazard ratio 1.512; p = 0.0351). AoAC detectable on chest X-ray is a 
      strong independent predictor of CV events in accordance with PWV. Risk 
      stratification by assessment of AoAC may provide important information for 
      management of atherosclerotic disease in HD patients.

TI  - Successful treatment of calcific uremic arteriolopathy with sodium thiosulfate in a 
      renal transplant recipient.

AB  - Abstract Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare but life-threatening 
      disorder of arteriolar calcification. It frequently leads to severe ischemia, 
      intense pain, and tissue necrosis with non-healing skin ulcerations. CUA usually 
      occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those on dialysis, 
      and its occurrence is rare in kidney transplant recipients. The treatment of this 
      disorder is not clearly defined, and no randomized prospective trials are available. 
      Treatment has focused on optimizing dialysis treatment, control of bone mineral 
      parameters, wound care, experimental anticalcification therapies-using 
      bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, and hyperbaric oxygen. Such 
      treatments are based on the pathophysiological considerations and evidences from 
      case reports or series. Recently, several cases have reported about the emerging 
      benefits of intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) in the treatment of CUA. STS has 
      resulted in rapid pain relief, wound healing, and prevention of death. We report a 
      case of CUA in a 63-year-old Caucasian man with a functioning renal allograft. In 
      this patient, intravenous STS was administered for 8 months, which was the principal 
      therapy, which resulted in complete resolution of the CUA and skin healing.

PG  - 51-56
LID - 10.17116/terarkh2016881251-56 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the nature of changes in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and 
      other bone mineral metabolism parameters detectable in the blood of patients with 
      end-stage chronic renal failure (CRF) and to analyze their links to the development 
      of cardiovascular events in uremic intoxication. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 
      patients (45 men and 30 women) aged 23 to 66 years (mean age, 53±2.1 years) with 
      Stage VD CKF were examined. The levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, 
      phosphorus, the morphogenetic protein FGF-23, and the cardiospecific protein 
      troponin I were investigated. Doppler echocardiography was performed on an Aloka 
      4000 machine. Left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMI), LV systolic and diastolic 
      function, and peak systolic blood flow velocity in the aortic arch (Vps) were 
      estimated. RESULTS: As LVMI became higher, there were increases in the level of PTH 
      and that of FGF-23 that plays a significant role in the processes of bone remodeling 
      and vascular calcification. Analysis of correlations between a change in FGF-23 
      concentrations depending on the morphological and functional parameters of the 
      cardiovascular system (CVS) revealed a strong direct correlation between FGF-23 
      levels and LVMI (r=0.746; p<0.01), a significant inverse correlation between FGF-23 
      and ejection fraction (r=-0.901; p<0.05), and a direct correlation of FGF-23 and 
      troponin I (r=0.544; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: FGF-2 increasing from moderate to very 
      high levels indicates that there is a high risk for remodeling processes in the CVS 
      even in the absence of baseline echocardiographic signs of myocardial hypertrophy, 
      normal aortic pulse wave velocity, and compensation of other risk factors, such as 
      hypertension, uremia, hyperparathyroidism, even without increasing the markers of 
      cardiovascular events, such as hyperphosphatemia. The elevated level of FGF-23 
      suggests that there is a need for cardioprotective therapy, the goal of which is to 
      correct of the level of this factor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to investigate the factors associated with elevated 
      plasma FGF23 (cFGF23) levels in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and to 
      determine whether plasma FGF23 level is related to aortic artery calcification 
      (AAC). METHODS: This study included 120 MHD patients and 20 controls. The FGF23 
      level was measured using a C-terminal assay and AAC was detected by a lateral lumbar 
      X-ray plain. RESULTS: Plasma FGF23 levels were significantly higher among dialysis 
      patients compared to controls: FGF23 level of 27691.42 ± 55646.41 RU/mL in MHD 
      patients versus 49.89 ± 23.94 RU/mL in health people. Significant correlations were 
      observed between FGF23 levels and vintage, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum 
      phosphate, total calcium, 25(OH)D, urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCR). 
      Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the independent parameters 
      associated with FGF23 level were serum phosphate, total calcium, parathyroid hormone 
      (PTH), SCR, and prealbumin. There were 73 patients (60.83%) with visible 
      calcification in the abdominal aorta. Bivariate analysis showed that AAC score 
      correlated with FGF23, phosphate, total calcium, vintage, age, and diastolic blood 
      pressure. Forward logistic analysis showed that the independent parameters 
      associated with AAC were age, total protein, and Lg FGF23. CONCLUSION: Plasma FGF23 
      level is significant increased in hemodialysis patients and is independently 
      associated with AAC.

      catheter for hemodialysis.

LID - 10.5301/jva.5000113 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcifications usually affect the arteries, while central vein 
      calcifications are rare. A 45-year-old hemodialysis patient underwent a chest CT 
      scan before central vein catheterization required for arteriovenous access 
      thrombosis, in July 2011. He was on hemodialysis since 1995 and from 2005 on 
      warfarin treatment because of repeated thrombosis and dysfunction of arteriovenous 
      fistula and central vein catheters (CVC). A previous tunneled CVC placed in the left 
      external jugular vein was removed in December 2010. Eight months later a chest CT 
      scan showed a 79-mm irregular, linear, tubular radiopaque density in the superior 
      vena cava and left brachiocephalic vein. The possibility of a retained catheter 
      fragment was considered, but the final diagnosis was: calcified "cast" adherent to 
      the vessel wall. This is the first report of an intravenous calcified "cast" 
      (originating from peri-catheter calcification) retained after removal of a tunneled 
      dialysis CVC. This finding is significant because it mimics a retained catheter 
      fragment possibly leading to misdiagnosis and exposing patients to additional risk 
      for unnecessary retrieving interventions. Catheter removal or over the wire 
      substitution in the presence of a calcified cast could also be considered a risky

TI  - Reduction of Dialysate Calcium Level Reduces Progression of Coronary Artery 
      Calcification and Improves Low Bone Turnover in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 2475-86
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2015030268 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to high Ca concentrations may influence the development of low-turnover 
      bone disease and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients on hemodialysis 
      (HD). In this randomized, controlled study, we investigated the effects of lowering 
      dialysate Ca level on progression of CAC and histologic bone abnormalities in 
      patients on HD. Patients on HD with intact parathyroid hormone levels ≤300 pg/ml 
      receiving dialysate containing 1.75 or 1.50 mmol/L Ca (n=425) were randomized to the 
      1.25-mmol/L Ca (1.25 Ca; n=212) or the 1.75-mmol/L Ca (1.75 Ca; n=213) dialysate 
      arm. Primary outcome was a change in CAC score measured by multislice computerized 
      tomography; main secondary outcome was a change in bone histomorphometric parameters 
      determined by analysis of bone biopsy specimens. CAC scores increased from 452±869 
      (mean±SD) in the 1.25 Ca group and 500±909 in the 1.75 Ca group (P=0.68) at baseline 
      to 616±1086 and 803±1412, respectively, at 24 months (P=0.25). Progression rate was 
      significantly lower in the 1.25 Ca group than in the 1.75 Ca group (P=0.03). The 
      prevalence of histologically diagnosed low bone turnover decreased from 85.0% to 
      41.8% in the 1.25 Ca group (P=0.001) and did not change in the 1.75 Ca group. At 24 
      months, bone formation rate, trabecular thickness, and bone volume were higher in 
      the 1.25 Ca group than in the 1.75 Ca group. Thus, lowering dialysate Ca levels 
      slowed the progression of CAC and improved bone turnover in patients on HD with 
      baseline intact parathyroid hormone levels ≤300 pg/ml.

AB  - We describe a case of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia in a 37-year-old man with 
      hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease due to diabetes who was admitted to 
      our hospital with abdominal pain. A plain radiograph of the abdomen showed distended 
      loops of small bowel and gas in the hepatic portal vein. Multidetector computed 
      tomography showed massive wall calcification of the superior mesenteric artery and 
      its collaterals, pneumatosis intestinalis of a segment of the jejunum, and 
      porto-mesenteric vein gas. Urgent laparotomy confirmed segmental necrosis of the 
      jejunum, which was resected. Pathologic examination showed whole-layer necrosis of 
      the resected bowel without arterial or venous thrombosis. Nonocclusive mesenteric 
      ischemia is an increasingly recognized and potentially lethal complication in 
      hemodialysis patients. In the present case, critical factors for the development of 
      nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia may have included prolonged hypotension during 
      hemodialysis treatments that reduced blood flow to the small bowel and massive 
      vascular calcification that negatively affected compliance of the superior 
      mesenteric artery and its branches.

TI  - Regression of vascular calcification in a parathyroidectomized patient on dialysis 
      with untreated hypocalcemia over 12-year follow-up .
PG  - 333-339
AB  - Although some experimental targets involved in calcium deposition are emerging, no 
      intervention has been described to reliably reverse vascular calcification (VC). We 
      report a case of severe VC regression in a parathyroidectomized patient on 
      hemodialysis over 12-year follow-up, highlighting the use of calcium-free phosphate 
      binders and a 2.5 mEq/L calcium dialysate for reducing calcium loading, despite 
      persistent asymptomatic hypocalcemia occurrences. This case suggests that 
      phosphate-binder choice and calcium dialysate concentration could be influenced by 
      other components of CKD-MBD besides biochemical parameters, such as the presence of 
      VC, so concluding that asymptomatic hypocalcemia may not be as harmful as once 
      supposed, and conferring greater prognostic weight to the presence of VC than to 
      calcium levels. .

AB  - We'll report 2 dialysis cases which came to our clinic for the symptoms caused by 
      hypercalcemia. Patients complained of sleeplessness, itching, headache, palpitation, 
      apathy, akinesis, leanness, foot gangrene and so on. Hypercalcemia is one of the 
      complication of vitamin D and calcium carbonate administration in chronic renal 
      failure, though the frequency and risk are not clearly documented. Hypercalcemia 
      aggravates the outcome of patients on dialysis and contributes to vascular 
      calcification in long term. Recently various factors involving cardiovascular 
      calcification are discussed, but first of all we must be very careful for the 
      symptoms of hypercalcemia, and careful monitoring of plasma calcium concentration 
      are recommended.

LID - 10.1007/s12928-013-0205-9 [doi]
AB  - A 75-year-old hemodialysis patient with right critical limb ischemia received 
      endovascular therapy for a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a diffusely calcified 
      superficial femoral artery (SFA). During a retrograde approach, a Brockenbrough 
      needle (BN) was able to penetrate the calcified hard plaque formed in the middle 
      segment of the CTO. Moreover, bougie dilatation with the BN allowed balloon crossing 
      and stent deployment, even after failure to pass a 2.0-mm monorail balloon across 
      the plaque. These results suggest that the BN offers a new therapeutic option in the 
      penetration and modification of severely calcified CTO in SFA.

AB  - We present a rare case of a distal anastomotic pseudoaneurysm after bypass grafting 
      to a porcelainized peroneal artery. Successful management was achieved by 
      percutaneous thrombin injection. This case illustrates the value of nonsurgical 
      intervention for this rare but difficult problem.

TI  - The role of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation in maintaining acid-base balance 
      and its influence on the cardiovascular system in chronic hemodialysis patients - 
      results of a prospective study.
PG  - 449-454
AB  - Background: Major acid-base variations during dialysis and the imbalances in serum 
      calcium levels intensified by them play a role in cardiovascular damage of 
      hemodialysis patients. Early vascular walls modifications can be objectified by 
      determining the pulse wave velocity (PWV) - a marker of vascular stiffness that is 
      associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Material and methods: This 
      was a prospective study conducted on 63 chronic hemodialysis patients with diuresis 
      above 500 mL/ 24 hours and predialysis blood pressure below 160 mmHg (treatment 
      controlled) randomized in two groups for 12 months - the study group receiving 
      interdialitic oral sodium bicarbonate doses and control group, without oral sodium 
      bicarbonate supplementation, but receiving higher bicarbonate prescriptions in 
      dialysis. All the patients were monthly evaluated by biochemical tests (serum 
      calcium, phosphate, iPTH, bicarbonate), the assessment of prescribed doses of 
      phosphate binders being undergone. Two PWV determinations and chest X-ray exams for 
      coronary calcifications were done - at the beginning and end of the study for every 
      patient. Results: In the study group (n = 29), the mean age was 56.48 ± 12.78 years 
      and the average duration of dialysis was 55.51 ± 34.53 months, the mean dialysis 
      bicarbonate was 29.81 ± 1.41 mEq/ L and 27 of them (subgroup 0) had alkaline reserve 
      (AR) 20-22 mEq/ L. The control group (n = 34) had a mean age of 57.35 ± 15.32 years 
      and the mean dialysis duration 59.67 ± 34.79 months, with an average level of 
      dialysis bicarbonate of 33 ± 2.2 mEq/ L necessary to maintain AR within guidelines. 
      Depending on the mean AR obtained, this group was divided into three subgroups 
      (subgroup 1, subgroup 2, and subgroup 3). There were statistically significant 
      differences regarding the necessary of dialysis bicarbonate (p < 0.001), average 
      serum calcium levels (p < 0.001) and serum phosphorus (p < 0.001), as well as PWV 
      mean values and the number of vascular calcifications (p = 0.036) between the study 
      and the control group. The average dose of phosphate binders was significantly 
      higher in the study group (p = 0.01). At the end of the study, the serum iPTH 
      average levels were decreased in the study group (p < 0.001) and significantly 
      increased in the control group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Avoiding large variations 
      in serum bicarbonate levels is an important step in hemodialysis patients' 
      management because wide acidosis-alkalosis variation can increase cardiovascular 
      risks in terms of altering the vessel walls elasticity and favoring their 
      calcifications. Abbreviations: GFR = glomerular filtration rate,PWV = pulse wave

TI  - Correlation of pre-existing radial artery macrocalcifications with late patency of 
      primary radiocephalic fistulas in diabetic hemodialysis patients.

LID - S0741-5214(14)00309-7 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing radial 
      artery macrocalcification (Mönckeberg type of arteriosclerosis) on patency rates of 
      radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs) in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this observational prospective study, the 
      long-term patency rates (primary outcome measures) of RCFs in ESRD diabetics who had 
      Mönckeberg radial (±brachial) artery disease (calcified [C] group) were compared 
      with those obtained in ESRD diabetics who had healthy, noncalcified vessels before 
      RCF construction (healthy [H] group). Vessel calcification was assessed by plain 
      two-dimensional radiography. For inclusion in the C-group, uniform linear railroad 
      track-type macrocalcifications of at least 6 cm in length, in the medial wall of the 
      radial artery ipsilateral to RCF creation, were required. Patients were included in 
      the H-group if the radial artery ipsilateral to the RCF creation was free of any 
      macrocalcification, of either intima or media type. Any intimal-like plaque with 
      irregular and patchy distribution was an exclusion criterion for both groups. 
      Patients in both groups also were required to have suitable upper limb vascular 
      anatomy on the basis of ultrasound imaging before RCF creation (cephalic vein of 
      minimum diameter of 1.6 mm, without stenosis or thrombosis in all outflow areas, and 
      radial artery of minimum diameter of 1.5 mm, without proximal hemodynamically 
      significant stenosis). Secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality. 
      Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparison between groups. RESULTS: The arm 
      radiograph at the site of possible fistula construction showed abnormality in 39 
      patients (C-group, 47 RCFs), whereas 33 patients had noncalcified ("healthy") 
      vascular anatomy (H-group, 40 RCFs). Mean duration of the diabetic disease at the 
      time of RCF creation was 8.9 ± 5.6 years (range, 2-25 years) for the H-group and 14 
      ± 9.9 years (range, 1-40 years) for the C-group (P = .018). The mean follow-up 
      period for H-group and C-group was 51.9 ± 35.9 months (range, 0.1-126 months) and 
      26.1 ± 31.6 months (range, 0.1-144 months), respectively (P = .0006). Forty-four 
      patients died during the follow-up period. Primary patency rates at 12, 24, 36, and 
      48 months for C-group vs H-group were 50.2% vs 80%, 36.5% vs 72.3%, 32.4% vs 67.9%, 
      and 29.1% vs 59.3% (P = .0019). Respective values for secondary patency rates were 
      52.4% vs 87.5%, 40.9% vs 82.4%, 36.6% vs 78.1%, and 33.2% vs 72.8% (P = .00064). 
      Patient survival rates at 24 and 48 months were 56.1% and 46.4% for C-group and 
      92.4% and 67.4% for H-group, respectively (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: ESRD diabetics 
      with radial artery Mönckeberg calcifications receiving RCFs had worse late clinical 
      outcomes compared with ESRD diabetics with healthy distal arm vessels receiving the 
      same access. The long-term benefit of RCFs may be lost in diabetics with extensively 
      calcified vessels, and preferably the brachial artery should be used instead.

TI  - Effect of the duration of dialysis on survival in a cohort of chronic haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 782-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in chronic 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients, and usually progress with time. Whether the length of 
      dialysis treatment in chronic HD patients is a significant independent risk factor 
      of death is not clear. METHODS: A cohort of chronic HD patients from the Okinawa 
      Dialysis Study, n=1243 (720 men, 523 women), was followed from January 1991 to 
      December 2000, and their survival rates were compared against the duration of HD, 
      which was calculated in months from the start of dialysis therapy to January 1991. A 
      Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to examine the influence of 
      the duration of dialysis on survival, after adjusting for other factors such as age, 
      sex, serum albumin concentration and diastolic blood pressure. The hazards ratio and 
      95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in both diabetic and non-diabetic 
      patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of dialysis was 61.9 months and ranged from 1 
      to 233 months. The numbers of patients who died, underwent renal transplantation or 
      were transferred outside Okinawa were 568 (45.7%), 61 (4.9%) and 14 (1.1%), 
      respectively, during the study. The hazards ratio (95% CI) was 1.002 (1.000-1.004, 
      P=0.0245) for non-diabetic patients and 1.006 (1.001-1.011, P=0.0214) for diabetic 
      patients, suggesting that the longer the duration of dialysis, the greater the risk 
      of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that prolonged dialysis is a significant 
      predictor of death in chronic HD patients, in particular diabetic patients. Whether 
      this is related to the progression of the atherosclerotic process or to uraemic 
      conditions remains to be shown.

TI  - Low serum intact parathyroid hormone level is an independent risk factor for overall 
      mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in incident dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 2717-2726
LID - 10.1007/s00198-016-3636-1 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal bone dynamics is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. The level of serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) is 
      widely used as a bone dynamic marker. We investigated the effect of the mean level 
      of serum iPTH on overall mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in incident dialysis 
      patients. PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD). CKD-MBD is classified as low- or high-turnover bone disease 
      according to the bone dynamics; both are related to vascular calcification in ESRD. 
      To evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 
      on ESRD patients, we investigated the effects of time-averaged serum intact PTH 
      (TA-iPTH) levels on overall mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular 
      events (MACCEs) in incident dialysis patients. METHODS: Four hundred thirteen 
      patients who started dialysis between January 2009 and September 2013 at Yonsei 
      University Health System were enrolled. The patients were divided into three groups 
      according to TA-iPTH levels during the 12 months after the initiation of dialysis: 
      group 1, <65 pg/ml; group 2, 65-300 pg/ml; and group 3, >300 pg/ml. Cox regression 
      analyses were performed to determine the prognostic value of TA-iPTH for overall 
      mortality and MACCEs. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57 ± 15 years, and 
      222 patients (54 %) were men. During the median follow-up of 40.8 ± 29.3 months, 49 
      patients (12 %) died, and MACCEs occurred in 55 patients (13 %). The multivariate 
      Cox regression analyses demonstrated that a low TA-iPTH level was an independent 
      risk factor for both overall mortality (group 2 as reference; group 1: hazard ratio 
      (HR) = 2.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-3.83, P = 0.023) and MACCEs 
      (HR = 1.82, 95 % CI = 1.04-3.20, P = 0.036) in incident dialysis patients after 
      adjustment for confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Low serum TA-iPTH is a useful 
      clinical marker of both overall mortality and MACCEs in patients undergoing incident 
      dialysis, mediated by vascular calcification.

TI  - Relationship between aortic pulse wave velocity, selected proinflammatory cytokines, 
      and vascular calcification parameters in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 142-8
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32836569c7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification and arterial stiffening are cardiovascular risk 
      factors among chronic kidney disease patients. Elevated aortic pulse wave velocity 
      (AoPWV) is an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between 
      inflammatory and vascular calcification parameters and arterial wall stiffness in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The study included 57 patients (27 women and 30 men) aged from 19 to 75 
      years (mean age 53 ± 13), treated by peritoneal dialysis during 4-100 months (mean 
      30.4 months). The concentrations of albumin, lipids, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, 
      high-sensitive C-reactive protein, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), 
      osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), fibroblast growth factor 23, fetuin A, 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total calcium (Ca), and phosphates (Pi) were measured. 
      AoPWV was performed using a tonometric method, common carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CCA-IMT) by ultrasonography evaluation, and calcium scoring (CaSc) with 
      multirow spiral computed tomography (MSCT). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, AoPWV 
      correlated negatively with osteocalcin (R = -0.37; P = 0.005) and positively with 
      OPG (R = 0.41; P = 0.002). Additionally, AoPWV was significantly positively 
      associated with inflammatory parameters: IL-6 (R = 0.35; P = 0.009), TGF-β1 
      (R = 0.27; P = 0.047), and white blood cell (WBC) count (R = 0.33; P = 0.01). There 
      were also positive correlations between AoPWV and imaging data: CCA-IMT (R = 0.32; 
      P = 0.02) and CaSc (R = 0.38; P = 0.004). AoPWV did not correlate with calcium, 
      phosphate, Ca × Pi index, or iPTH concentration. After multiple adjustments, 
      osteocalcin was the only significant predictor of AoPWV. In logistic regression 
      adjusted for age, hypertension, and mean arterial pressure at AoPWV evaluation, only 
      osteocalcin was significantly associated with high (above median) AoPWV values [odds 
      ratio 0.96 (0.92-0.99) per unit increase in osteocalcin]. CONCLUSION: OPG 
      concentration and some inflammatory markers (WBC count, IL-6, TGF-β1) influenced the 
      severity of arterial wall stiffness in CKD patients. Measurement of osteocalcin 
      seems to be the best predictor of AoPWV.

TI  - The impact of pre-existing radial artery pathology by histological assessment on the 
      maturation, function and patency of the radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis.
PG  - 239-249
LID - 10.23736/S0392-9590.19.04132-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We prospectively analyzed the effect of preexisting structural changes 
      of the radial artery (RA) wall by histological examination on the wrist 
      radiocephalic fistula (RCF) outcomes. METHODS: During RCF creation, one segment of 
      the RA wall was collected and its histomorphometric analysis was performed. The RCF 
      function was evaluated by measuring blood flow rate. RESULTS: At the end of 
      follow-up, 75.7% of the thirty-seven patients enrolled were performing hemodialysis 
      by using their successful RCF and 24.3% of them showed early RCF failure. Compared 
      to patients with a healthy RA, the RCF of those with medial RA microcalcification 
      reached up a lower flow and a shorter primary patency (P=0.005 and P=0.040, 
      respectively). The RA microcalcification was predictive of the RCF function 
      (coefficient -614.9, 95% CI: -994.7 to -235.1, P=0.003). Compared to patients with 
      successful RCF, those with failed RCF had a greater frequency of weak RCF thrill 
      after releasing the clamps (P=0.045). Dependence on hemodialysis during RCF 
      placement was predictive of its early failure (OR: 23.2, 95% CI: 1.76 to 306.9, 
      P=0.017). Both having at least one cardiovascular comorbidity (HR 4.30, 95% CI: 1.29 
      to 14.39, P=0.018) and a thicker media layer of the RA (HR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.87 to 
      2.15, P=0.002) were predictive of primary RCF patency. CONCLUSIONS: The function and 
      survival of the successful RCF were related to preoperative RA abnormalities such as 
      microcalcification and media layer thickness. Both dependence on hemodialysis during 
      RCF placement and an attenuated RCF thrill were associated with early RCF failure.

TI  - Does coronary artery calcification in patients with diabetic nephropathy depend on 
      the advancement of renal failure?
PG  - 39-42
AB  - Calcium-phosphate disorders and vascular calcification are highly prevalent in 
      patients with diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. The aim of the study was to compare 
      the prevalence and advancement of vascular calcification in patients with end-stage 
      diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and diabetic patients with chronic renal 
      disease stages 2-4. The study group included 31 patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      diabetic nephropathy divided into 2 groups: 12 patients (aged 50-74 years: mean 
      58.6+/-8.8) undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients (aged 46-82 years; mean 
      65.8+/-9.7) with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4 (GFR range 24-78 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
      Coronary artery calcification score, was assessed using multi-slice computed 
      tomography. Coronary artery calcification score did not differ significantly between 
      groups (CaSc values 1085.2 vs 452.4 AgU; NS). The patients undergoing peritoneal 
      dialysis showed significantly higher levels of parathyroid hormone (658.2 vs. 74.3 
      pg/ml; p=0.001), fibrinogen (5.82 vs. 3.89 g/l; p<0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase 
      (330.9 vs. 168.0 U/l; p=0.001). Despite more advanced abnormalities in 
      calcium-phosphate balance parameters and more active inflammation in peritoneal 
      dialysis subjects we failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference 
      in coronary artery calcification score between patients with diabetic nephropathy on 
      peritoneal dialysis and those with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4.

TI  - Calcium deposition in the skin of a hemodialysis patient with widespread skin 
      necrosis.
PG  - 605-10
AB  - Rapidly progressive skin necrosis involving large areas of the skin associated with 
      extensive vascular calcification was observed in a 39-year-old male patient on 
      chronic hemodialysis. Histological examination of the periphery of a skin ulcer 
      showed that subepidermal arterioles were occluded with fibrin deposits and that 
      calcification was demonstrated in subcutaneous small arteries and arterioles. 
      Electron microscopically, electron-dense materials, granular, crystal-like, 
      vacuolar, or laminated, were found not only in arterial walls of the periphery of an 
      ulcer but also, to a lesser extent, in those of normal-appearing skin. The skin 
      necrosis gradually healed with antiseptic topical treatments and the injection of 
      recombinant erythropoietin. The relationship between the vascular lesions in 
      hemodialysis patients and progressive skin necrosis is not well known, although a 
      combination of local and systemic factors may play an important role in the 
      development of vascular calcification and skin necrosis in uremic and hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - The role of fetuin-A in cardiac functions and metabolism in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 375-82
AB  - AIM: Fetuin-A is a member of protease inhibitors that act as an inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification. In our study, the relationship of fetuin-A with metabolic 
      and echocardiographic parameters in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been 
      investigated. METHODS: Besides demographic, clinical and laboratory data, fetuin-A 
      level was recorded. Echocardiographic examinations were performed by the same 
      operator. RESULTS: Fifty-two chronic PD patients (mean age: 52.7 ± 15.4 years) and 
      31 healthy volunteers (mean age: 41.3 ± 10.7 years) were included. Fetuin-A levels 
      were significantly lower in the patient group (57.5 ± 31.5 ng/mL vs. 72.5 ± 34.0 
      ng/mL, P = 0.002). There was a significant relation between age and fetuin-A levels 
      (P = 0.025). Four patients with chronic heart failure had significantly lower 
      fetuin-A levels compared with those without. There was no relation between fetuin-A 
      levels and the presence of diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy and 
      ischemic heart disease. No relationship was detected between fetuin-A level and any 
      echocardiographic parameter. Age and hematocrite were correlated negatively, and 
      serum albumin positively with fetuin-A levels. On linear regression analysis, 
      fetuin-A level was related with age, hematocrite and presence of heart failure. 
      CONCLUSION: PD patients with heart failure have significantly lower fetuin-A levels. 
      Age is a main determinant of fetuin-A level and fetuin-A may act as a negative acute 
      phase reactant in PD patients.

TI  - [Study on vascular calcification in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD): special reference to active vitamin D (VD) treatment].
PG  - 1171-80
AB  - Cardiovascular complications, such as vascular calcification (VC), have been a major 
      concern in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. The pathogenesis of this VC has 
      been attributed to the altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, but the 
      contributing factors have not been clarified. In order to investigate these factors, 
      38 CAPD patients were divided into two sub-groups according to the absence of aortic 
      calcification (Group-A; n = 18) or the presence of aortic calcification (Group-B; n 
      = 20). The number of elderly patients was larger and the duration of CAPD was longer 
      in Group-B than in Group-A. Calcium and phosphate metabolism and serum lipids levels 
      did not differ significantly between groups and the number of patients given VD was 
      8/18 in Group-A and 14/20 in Group-B. In order to explore the progression of VC in 
      CAPD patients given long-term treatment with VD, 22 patients who were matched for 
      the duration of CAPD were analyzed. These were divided into two sub-groups according 
      to whether they were treated with VD (Group-C; n = 11) or not treated with VD 
      (Group-D; n = 11). Radiological findings (such as the degree of aortic 
      calcification), bone mineral content, divalent ions, parathyroid hormone levels and 
      lipid profiles were examined. The prevalence of patients with aortic calcification 
      was significantly higher in Group-D than in Group-C (7/11 v. s. 2/11, P < 0.05). 
      However, lipids, mineral and endocrinological parameters did not differ between the 
      sub-groups. No significant difference in the calcium and phosphate balance was 
      observed. The bone mineral content revealed no difference between both of the 
      sub-groups. VD administration by conventional mode, even without significant 
      suppression of PTH or increase of bone mineral content, may enhance vessel 
      calcification in patients on long-term CAPD.

TI  - Matrix GLA protein gene polymorphisms: clinical correlates and cardiovascular 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased vascular calcification plays an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It 
      is the result of an active ossification process counteracted by 'protective' 
      proteins, such as matrix GLA protein (MGP). Polymorphisms of MGP have been 
      identified. METHODS: The aim of this study was to define the distribution of two MGP 
      polymorphisms (-7, -138) in 99 hemodialysis (HD) patients, in 26 patients with CKD 
      stage 3 and in 135 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were followed up 
      for 12 months to record any cardiovascular deaths. The cause of death was determined 
      by medical doctors, considering the medical history of each patient. The primers 
      were designed with Primer Express software. RESULTS: MGP -138TT homozygotes were 
      more frequent in the HD group versus controls (p = 0.0004). Additionally, the 
      frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in the HD group (p = 0.0006). The 
      frequency of the A allele of MGP-7 was significantly higher both in the HD group (p 
      = 0.033) and in the CKD group (p = 0.0017) versus controls. MGP-7 GG homozygotes 
      were significantly less common in the CKD group than in controls (p = 0.037). 
      Combination -138TT -7AA was significantly more frequent in both CKD patients (p = 
      0.001) and in HD patients (p = 0.029) than in controls. Seventeen out of 99 HD 
      patients experienced fatal cardiovascular events. Sixteen (94.1%) were -138TT 
      homozygotes and either -7AA homozygotes or -7GA heterozygotes. CONCLUSION: This 
      study suggests that CKD and HD patients have a different distribution of MGP gene 
      polymorphism as compared with the normal population. Altered MGP gene polymorphism 
      may be a negative prognostic factor for the progression to end-stage renal disease 
      and for cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

LID - e0203157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal 
      disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney 
      transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular calcification. 
      Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by vitamin-K-dependent matrix 
      γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney transplantation or phosphate 
      binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. Therefore, we studied the influence of 
      kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on vitamin K status. METHODS: We 
      measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low 
      vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82), 
      peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n = 
      36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear 
      regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder 
      use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential confounders. 
      RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP levels 
      were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 pmol/L) 
      compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients 
      on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate binder was not associated 
      with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) compared to no phosphate binders 
      (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used sevelamer monotherapy, which was 
      associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist use. CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney 
      transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin 
      K status after transplantation. Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher 
      dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more 
      attention to vitamin K status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for 
      protection against vascular calcification.

TI  - Vitamin K2 supplementation in haemodialysis patients: a randomized dose-finding 
      study.
PG  - 1385-90
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis patients suffer from accelerated vascular calcification. 
      The vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) is one of the most powerful 
      inhibitors of vascular calcification. Haemodialysis patients have high levels of the 
      inactive form of MGP (desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated-MGP, dp-uc-MGP) and may 
      benefit from pharmacological doses of vitamin K2 (menaquinone) to improve the 
      calcification inhibitory activity of MGP. METHODS: To determine the optimal dose of 
      menaquinone-7 (MK-7) for MGP activation, 200 chronic haemodialysis patients were 
      recruited to randomly receive 360, 720 or 1080 µg of MK-7 thrice weekly for 8 weeks. 
      Dp-uc-MGP was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Dietary intake of vitamin K1 
      (phylloquinone) and menaquinone was estimated based on a detailed questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, dp-uc-MGP was not associated with phylloquinone intake (P = 
      0.92), but correlated inversely with menaquinone intake (P = 0.023). MK-7 
      supplementation dose dependently reduced dp-uc-MGP. The levels decreased by 17, 33 
      and 46% in the respective groups. Drop-outs were mainly due to gastrointestinal 
      side-effects related to the unpleasant smell of the tablets. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic 
      haemodialysis patients have high levels of inactive MGP, possibly related to a low 
      dietary vitamin K intake. Pharmacological doses of MK-7 dose-dependently reduce 
      dp-uc-MGP. Menaquinone supplementation may be a novel approach to prevent vascular 
      calcifications in chronic haemodialysis patients.

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin, arterial stiffness, and mortality in normoalbuminemic 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1695-701
LID - 10.1007/s00198-010-1377-0 [doi]
AB  - A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor for vascular 
      calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. OPG and pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV) were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (>3 years) 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients who were prospectively followed for 6 years. In 
      long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, OPG levels were strongly 
      linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome. INTRODUCTION: A high 
      circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for vascular calcification and 
      mortality in Western chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients but it is not known if 
      this is true for Japanese CKD patients, where a different risk profile may operate. 
      METHODS: OPG and PWV were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term 
      (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients (median age 62 years) who were 
      prospectively followed for 6 years. RESULTS: OPG levels were associated in 
      multivariate analysis with age, dialysis vintage, history of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD) and parathyroid hormone levels. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate 
      with OPG. Patients with clinical history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels 
      and OPG levels were positively correlated to PWV, an index of arterial stiffness. 
      These associations were independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes. 
      During the follow-up period, 40 deaths, including 25 cardiovascular deaths, were 
      recorded. In crude analysis, each unit of increase in OPG was associated with 
      increased all-cause (hazard ratios 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD 
      mortality (1.14 [1.07-1.21]), which persisted after adjustment for age, sex, 
      dialysis vintage, diabetes, and baseline CVD (1.12 [1.05-1.19] and 1.11 [1.02-1.19], 
      all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In long-term 
      normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, with low prevalence of 
      inflammation, OPG levels were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse 
      outcome.

TI  - Wet gangrene in hemodialysis patients with calciphylaxisis is associated with a poor 
      prognosis.
PG  - 565-70
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare syndrome characterized by progressive vascular calcification 
      and ischemic tissue loss in patients with chronic renal failure. We report our 
      five-year experience with five patients who developed foot gangrene due to 
      calciphylaxis. All five patients had characteristic clinical, laboratory, and 
      radiologic findings of the disorder, but no diagnostic variable was uniformly 
      present. All five had progressed to advanced gangrene at the time of surgical 
      consultation. Despite aggressive local attempts to control infection, all five 
      patients died of septic complications. Parathyroidectomy was performed in three 
      patients but did not alter the course in any case. This small experience suggests 
      that the outcome of foot gangrene associated with calciphylaxis is predicated on the 
      degree of tissue loss. Aggressive local wound care does not appear to be adequate to 
      control infection in patients who have already developed gangrene. Although 
      parathyroidectomy may have important long-term advantages in patients with 
      calciphylaxis, it does not appear to affect outcome in these advanced cases.

      Mongolia.
PG  - 35-40
LID - 10.1159/000479616 [doi]
AB  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) occurs in patients with chronic renal failure 
      complicated with renal bone disease and soft tissue/vascular calcification. In 
      dialysis patients with severe SHPT, medical treatment may fail and parathyroidectomy 
      (PTX) is indicated for definitive treatment. Severe hypocalcemia from hungry bone 
      disease or postoperative hypoparathyroidism may occur during the postoperative 
      period. We report here a case of severe SHPT in a hemodialysis patient treated with 
      phosphate binders, calcitriol, and calcimimetics but who still required PTX. Severe 
      hypocalcemia with muscle cramps occurred postoperatively. Around 1 year after PTX, 
      anemia and features of SHPT have improved but the patient still has intermittent 
      hypocalcemia with suspected postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Regular comprehensive 
      assessment of calcium and phosphorus levels throughout all stages of chronic kidney 
      disease is vital. The postoperative period of PTX in SHPT patients is critical, 
      requiring monitoring to improve management.

PG  - 229-38
AB  - During the period 1970 to 1980 48 parathyroidectomies were performed in 46 patients 
      with chronic renal insufficiency. Thirty patients underwent 31 subtotal 
      parathyroidectomies and 17 patients underwent total parathyroidectomy with 
      parathyroid autotransplantation to the forearm. Ten patients were on conservative 
      renal treatment, 26 were on chronic haemodialysis and 12 had functioning kidney 
      transplants at the time of parathyroid surgery. The indication for parathyroidectomy 
      were clinical symptoms such as pruritus, bone and joint pain, neuromuscular 
      disorders and radiological skeletal abnormalities pointing to hyperparathyroidism 
      (HPT). Hypercalcaemia was present in 38 patients. The clinical symptoms and 
      radiological findings were favourably affected by parathyroid surgery but vascular 
      calcification was not affected by the operation in any of the patients. 
      Normocalcaemia was achieved after surgery in all patients except one, who had 
      residual parathyroid tissue in the neck. Vitamin D substitution was required in 
      about 30% of the patients regardless of the type of operation that was performed. 
      Recurrent HPT occurred in 9% with similar rates after both types of surgery. 
      However, recurrence was more easily managed after a total parathyroidectomy with 
      autotransplantation to the forearm than after a subtotal parathyroidectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disorders of mineral metabolism can facilitate the progression of 
      vascular calcification and are closely associated with adverse outcomes in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). miR-15b has been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of 
      key metabolism, stress response, and osteoblast differentiation. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: In this study, we detected miR-15b in the plasma of 30 patients with ESRD 
      and 20 healthy controls using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Compared with 
      healthy controls, the circulating levels of miR-15b were significantly reduced in 
      patients with ESRD. However, there is no significant difference in circulating 
      miR-15b levels when comparing prehemodialysis and posthemodialysis in patients with 
      ESRD. In addition, to further estimate the potential roles of aberrantly expressed 
      candidate miR-15b in the pathogenesis of ESRD, we utilized a bioinformatics 
      exploratory analysis and identified gene ontology "biological process" 
      classifications which revealed that dysregulated circulating miR-15b might be 
      involved in phosphate metabolism. Furthermore, circulating miR-15b positively 
      correlated with both estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.502, p = 0.003) and 
      hemoglobin levels (r = 0.432, p = 0.017) and inversely correlated with phosphate 
      level (r = -0.516, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that the 
      dysregulated miR-15b might contribute to the progression of ESRD by modulating genes 
      that might be involved in the phosphate metabolism, which might have the potential 
      of being used as a biomarker for monitoring disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic 
      kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests 
      correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D) levels<30ng/mL in patients treated with 
      maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a specific treatment protocol. STUDY 
      DESIGN: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial followed by a 
      26-week open-label study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 55 adult maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients with 25(OH)D levels<30ng/mL were recruited from June 2008 through 
      October 2009. INTERVENTION: Cholecalciferol, 25,000IU, per week orally versus 
      placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of individualized cholecalciferol prescription 
      based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality 
      Initiative) guidelines. OUTCOMES: Primary end point was the percentage of patients 
      with 25(OH)D levels≥30ng/mL at 13 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the percentage 
      of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 
      blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and 
      hypervitaminosis D. MEASUREMENTS: Blood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; 
      iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, 
      trimonthly; fetuin A and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and 
      aortic calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39. RESULTS: The primary 
      end point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo 
      group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P<0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 
      11 [IQR, 10-15]pg/mL; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target 
      calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P=0.03). Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphate and 
      iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26-week study phase did not 
      significantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level≥30ng/mL in patients issued from 
      the placebo group. LIMITATIONS: Small size of the study population. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Oral weekly administration of 25,000IU of cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an 
      effective, safe, inexpensive, and manageable way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D 
      levels in hemodialysis patients. Further evaluation of clinical end points is 
      suggested.

TI  - Serum sclerostin: relation with mortality and impact of hemodiafiltration.
PG  - 1217-1223
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein sclerostin (Scl; 22 kDa), which is involved in bone 
      metabolism, may play a role in vascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. In the present study, we investigated the relation between serum Scl 
      (sScl) and mortality. The effects of dialysis modality and the magnitude of the 
      convection volume in haemodiafiltration (HDF) on sScl were also investigated. 
      METHODS: In a subset of patients from the CONTRAST study, a randomized controlled 
      trial comparing HDF with HD, sScl was measured at baseline and at intervals of 6, 
      12, 24 and 36 months. Patients were divided into quartiles, according to their 
      baseline sScl. The relation between time-varying sScl and mortality with a 4-year 
      follow-up period was investigated using crude and adjusted Cox regression models. 
      Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal measurements of sScl. RESULTS: The 
      mean (±standard deviation) age of 396 test subjects was 63.6 (±13.9 years), 61.6% 
      were male and the median follow-up was 2.9 years. Subjects with the highest sScl had 
      a lower mortality risk than those with the lowest concentrations [adjusted hazard 
      ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.31-0.86, P = 0.01)]. Stratified models 
      showed a stable sScl in patients treated with HD (Δ +2.9 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -0.5 to 
      +6.3, P = 0.09) and a decreasing concentration in those treated with HDF (Δ -4.5 
      pmol/L/year, 95% CI -8.0 to -0.9, P = 0.02). The relative change in the latter group 
      was related to the magnitude of the convection volume. CONCLUSIONS: (i) A high sScl 
      is associated with a lower mortality risk in patients with end-stage kidney disease; 
      (ii) treatment with HDF causes sScl to fall; and (iii) the relative decline in 
      patients treated with HDF is dependent on the magnitude of the convection volume.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy reduces intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients with 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 323-31
LID - 10.1159/000350160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with vascular calcification 
      and arterial stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this 
      study was to analyze the frequency of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and 
      cardiovascular function before and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We compared predialytic and intradialytic blood 
      pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), and 
      cardiothoracic ratio 1 month before PTX, and 6 and 12 months after PTX. IDH was 
      defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in mean 
      arterial pressure ≥ 10 mmHg. RESULTS: At the time of PTX, the mean age of the 
      patients was 57.4 ± 12.0 years, and the mean dialysis vintage was 12.2 ± 5.8 years. 
      At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after PTX, the average numbers of sessions 
      disturbed by IDH during 13 dialysis sessions (1 month) were 6.4, 3.9 (p < 0.016 vs. 
      baseline), and 4.0 sessions (p < 0.037 vs. baseline, p = 0.801 vs. 6 months), 
      respectively. LVEF and RVEF were improved significantly after PTX. Furthermore, 
      volume status was also improved, as evidenced by the significantly greater 
      ultrafiltration volume and reduced cardiothoracic ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis 
      patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism are more likely to achieve 
      normotensive and euvolemic status after PTX, probably through improved heart 
      function and reduced IDH episodes.

TI  - The natural history of coronary calcification progression in a cohort of nocturnal 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with a markedly increased 
      cardiac calcification burden, as reflected by computed tomography scans of the 
      heart. Nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) is a novel form of renal replacement therapy 
      which has multiple physiologic effects that may affect vascular calcification, 
      including improvements in phosphate and uraemia control. The objective of the 
      present study is the determination of the natural history of coronary calcification 
      progression in patients converted to NHD, and the examination of the relationships 
      between calcification risk factors and calcification progression in these patients. 
      METHODS: Thirty-eight ESRD patients were converted to NHD, and included in our 
      observational cohort study. Coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) were 
      documented at baseline and post-conversion (mean interscan duration 16+/-1 months). 
      Other variables of interest included age, dialysis vintage, Framingham risk profile, 
      phosphate binder and vitamin D usage, and plasma levels of calcium, phosphate and 
      parathyroid hormone. RESULTS: Our cohort was stratified according to baseline 
      calcification burden (minimal calcification: CACS < or = 10 vs significant 
      calcification: CACS > 10). Twenty-four patients had baseline CACS < or = 10. These 
      patients demonstrated no change in coronary calcification after 1 year of NHD (from 
      0.7+/-0.5 to 6+/-3, P = 0.1). Fourteen patients had higher initial CACS at baseline 
      (1874+/-696), and demonstrated a non-significant 9% increase over 1 year to 
      2038+/-740 (P = 0.1). Plasma phosphate and calcium x phosphate product were 
      significantly reduced, as were calcium-based phosphate binder and antihypertensive 
      usage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to document CACS progression in a cohort 
      of NHD patients. Further analysis of the effect of NHD on the physiology of 
      cardiovascular calcification is required.

TI  - Cardiac calcification in adult hemodialysis patients. A link between end-stage renal 
      disease and cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 695-701
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of 
      calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves in 
      adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. 
      BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic heart 
      disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience accelerated 
      vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of mineral metabolism. 
      Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. 
      Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as measured by electron-beam 
      tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population. METHODS: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis patients who 
      received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. We 
      compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular 
      disease and determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular 
      calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional odds logistic 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 
      (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of 
      obstructive coronary artery disease in the general population. The CA calcium scores 
      were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and 
      angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the 
      prevalence of claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of 
      coronary calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, 
      diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and 
      phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density 
      lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not 
      significantly related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage was 
      significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly associated with 
      ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral 
      metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium (Ca)-based phosphate (P) binders, compared to non-Ca-based P 
      binders, contribute to vascular calcification, which is associated with 
      cardiovascular events. METHODS: The LANDMARK study is a multicenter, randomized, 
      open-label, parallel comparative study of lanthanum carbonate (LC) and calcium 
      carbonate (CC) in hemodialysis patients. Stable hemodialysis patients with intact 
      parathyroid hormone ≤240 pg/mL meeting ≥1 of the following criteria (age >65 years, 
      postmenopause, diabetes mellitus) were randomized into the LC and CC groups. LC 
      group patients initially received LC 750 mg/day or the previously used dose and were 
      titrated up to a maximum 2250 mg/day to achieve serum P levels of 3.5-6.0 mg/dL. CC 
      group patients received CC 3 g/day or the previously used dose and were titrated to 
      achieve the same P range. If the target serum P level was not achieved, non-Ca-based 
      P binders (other than LC) could also be added. The primary endpoint is survival time 
      free of cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction or stroke, and unstable angina. RESULTS: Overall, 2309 patients were 
      allocated to the LC (N = 1154) or CC group (N = 1155). At baseline, the mean age was 
      68.4 years, 40.4 % were women, 55.9 % had diabetes, 18.3 % had a history of ischemic 
      heart disease, and 13.9 % had cerebrovascular disease. A total of 184 patients 
      (8.4 %) had undergone coronary intervention procedures. Baseline characteristics 
      were well balanced between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The LANDMARK study will determine 
      whether LC, a non-Ca-based P binder, reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Modeling the implications of changes in vascular calcification in patients on 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 1532-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of 
      coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based 
      phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular 
      events, risk equations are needed. METHODS: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis 
      treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to 
      study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 
      years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified 
      using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography 
      (EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all 
      patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional 
      hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of 
      calcification, controlling for other characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion 
      was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered 
      an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic 
      blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of 
      cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a 
      calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a 
      score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000. CONCLUSION: In the absence 
      of long-term follow-up studies, these equations permit quantification of the 
      expected long-term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders 
      on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these 
      equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.

TI  - Vascular calcification and cardiovascular function in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 707-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and arterial stiffening are independent 
      predictors of all causes and cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Few data are currently available comparing vascular calcification and its 
      attendant functional cardiovascular consequences between CKD stage 4 patients and 
      both peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) (CKD stage 5) patients. METHOD: 
      We studied 134 subjects (60 HD, 28 PD and 46 CKD 4). Vascular calcification was 
      quantified using multi-slice spiral CT scanning of a 5 cm standardized segment of 
      superficial femoral artery. Pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity were 
      assessed using applanation tonometry, to determine arterial compliance. Further 
      digital arterial pulse wave analysis was used to measure systemic haemodynamic 
      variables. All medications were recorded and biochemical variables were time 
      averaged for the 6 months prior to entering the study. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent 
      of CKD 4 patients demonstrated vascular calcification as compared with CKD 5 (71% PD 
      and 73% HD, P = 0.02). HD patients had higher calcification scores (median 121) than 
      either PD (median 21) or CKD 4 (median 0) (P = 0.008). There were no significant 
      differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. Comparing tertiles of 
      patients (based on calcification score), increased calcification score was 
      associated with a reduction in arterial compliance (mean PWV 8.9 +/- 1.1, 11 +/- 
      3.6, 11.3 +/- 3.7 m/s, P = 0.005). The degree of calcification did not influence 
      systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP or heart rate. However, more heavily 
      calcified patients demonstrated significantly higher mean pulse pressures (58 +/- 
      19, 74 +/- 22 and 72 +/- 25 mmHg, P = 0.001), lower total peripheral resistance (1.5 
      +/- 1, 1.3 +/- 0.8, 0.9 +/- 0.4, P = 0.01) and higher stroke volume (84 +/- 25, 95 
      +/- 29, 106 +/- 39 ml, P = 0.01). More heavily calcified patients were significantly 
      older and predominantly male. CONCLUSION: This study has successfully utilized a 
      novel technique for the quantification of calcification. We have demonstrated 
      vascular calcification and associated cardiovascular dysfunction in CKD 4, PD and HD 
      with significant differences between the groups. Thirty percent of individuals show 
      no calcification, even those established on renal replacement therapy for a 
      prolonged period of time. Further work is required to identify factors which promote 
      progression of arterial calcification in those who are susceptible.

TI  - Association of dialysate calcium concentration with fetuin A level and carotid 
      intima-media thickness in peritoneal dialysis patients.

AB  - Serum fetuin A has been shown to be associated with the risk of vascular 
      calcification and atherosclerosis, and it can predict the onset of cardiovascular 
      mortality in dialysis patients. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an 
      accessible and reliable method to identify the subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the relationships between dialysate calcium 
      concentrations and fetuin A or cIMT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
      Forty patients, newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing 
      peritoneal dialysis, were enrolled in the study, with a calcium content of the 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution of 1.25 mmol/L in 20 patients (low-Ca group) and 
      1.75 mmol/L in 20 patients (standard-Ca group). The patients were followed up for 12 
      months after the PD conducted. Serum fetuin A was determined using a human fetuin A 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and cIMT was detected using ultrasonic wave. 
      We observed no difference between two groups with regard to the baseline data of 
      fetuin A, cIMT, calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, high sensitivity 
      CRP (hsCRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), or lipid parameters. After 12 months 
      follow-up, fetuin A (263.92 ± 16.1 vs. 282.76 ± 21.0, p = 0.017) and 
      calcium-phosphorus product (39.85 ± 7.76 vs. 47.50 ± 6.65, p = 0.009) were obviously 
      lower in the low-Ca group than standard-Ca group, the other serum parameters were 
      not different between these two groups. Compared with baseline data, serum fetuin A 
      concentration significantly reduced in low-Ca group ( p < 0.05). The number of 
      patients with increased cIMT and newly occurring cardiovascular events in the low-Ca 
      group were significantly reduced than standard-Ca group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, 
      our data suggest that low calcium dialysate treatment is associated with the 
      decreased serum fetuin A concentration and serum calcium-phosphorus product, and it 
      is associated with the reduced number of PD patients with increased cIMT or with 
      newly occurring cardiovascular events. However, more studies with lager sample size 
      should be performed in the future.

AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with a poor prognosis in dialysis patients. It 
      can be assessed with computed tomography but simple inoffice techniques may provide 
      useful information. We compared the results obtained with a simple noninvasive 
      technique with those obtained using multidetector computed tomography for aortic 
      arch calcification volume (AoACV) in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. The 
      enrolled study subjects were 63 (32 men and 31 women) maintenance HD patients. 
      Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a AoAC score 
      (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. The AoACV was increased, with a mean value of 6.6 
      ranging from 0% to 36.5%. The coefficient of intraobserver variation was less than 
      2.5%. Aortic arch calcification score was highly correlated with AoACV (r=0.635, 
      P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed age (F value=12.62, P<0.001) and pulse 
      pressure (F value=4.54, P=0.037) to be significant independent determinants of 
      AoACS. In conclusion, a simple measurement of AoACS may be useful for inoffice 
      imaging to choose a therapeutic regimen in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
      remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also 
      a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to 
      test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. METHODS: we measured 
      serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year 
      period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, 
      patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were 
      included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 
      patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower 
      creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl 
      (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk 
      analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and 
      gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve 
      these patients survival needs to be determined.

AB  - Sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-aluminum- and non-calcium-containing hydrogel, is an 
      effective phosphate binder in dialysis patients. The suppressive effect of the 
      switching from calcium carbonate to sevelamer hydrochloride on the progression of 
      vascular calcification was examined by measuring areas of calcification on routine 
      chest X-rays using image-analyzing software. The data of 69 maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients were analyzed retrospectively. Over a period of 18 months, 19 patients took 
      only sevelamer hydrochloride as a phosphate binder, while the other 50 patients took 
      only calcium carbonate. The area of calcification increased in the calcium carbonate 
      group, but did not change significantly in the sevelamer group. While the usefulness 
      of computed tomography in detecting vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients 
      has been reported previously, the suppressive effects of switching from calcium 
      carbonate to sevelamer hydrochloride on the progression of aortic calcification can 
      be observed without computed tomography by using the plain chest X-ray films that 
      are routinely performed in hemodialysis clinics.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia-induced vascular calcification and higher alkaline phosphatase 
      (ALP) levels-related high-turnover bone diseases are linked to mortality among 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nonetheless, no large epidemiological 
      study in patients with CKD has been conducted to investigate the interaction and 
      joint effect of hyperphosphatemia and higher ALP levels on mortality.We analyzed 
      11,912 maintenance hemodialysis patients from January 2005 to December 2010. 
      Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of death were calculated for different 
      categories of serum phosphorus and ALP using the Cox regression model. The 
      modification effect between serum phosphorus and ALP on mortality was determined 
      using an interaction product term.Both hypophosphatemia (<3.0 mg/dL) and 
      hyperphosphatemia (>7.0 mg/dL) were associated with incremental risks of death (aHR: 
      1.25 [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.09-1.44], and 1.15 [95% CI: 1.01-1.31], 
      respectively) compared to the lowest hazard ratio (HR) group (5 mg/dL ≤ phosphorus<6 
      mg/dL). ALP levels were linearly associated with incremental risks for death (aHR: 
      1.58 [95% CI: 1.41-1.76] for the category of ALP>150 U/L). In the stratified 
      analysis, patients with combined higher ALP (>150 U/L) and hyperphosphatemia (>7.0 
      mg/dL) had the greatest mortality risk (aHR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.69-2.98] compared to 
      the lowest HR group (ALP ≤ 60 U/L and 4 mg/dL ≤ phosphorus<5 mg/dL). Although the 
      effect of hyperphosphatemia on mortality seemed stronger in higher ALP levels, the 
      interaction was not statistically significant (P=0.22).The association between serum 
      phosphorus levels and mortality was not limited to higher ALP levels. Regardless of 
      serum ALP levels, we may control serum phosphorus levels merely toward the normal 
      range. While considering the joint effect of ALP and hyperphosphatemia on mortality, 
      the optimal phosphorus range should be stricter.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sevelamer, a noncalcium phosphate binder, has been shown to attenuate the 
      progression of vascular calcification and improve survival in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease undergoing dialysis compared with calcium-based binders. Using 
      real-world data from a cohort study and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment 
      Service database, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing sevelamer 
      with calcium acetate in dialysis patients from the perspective of the National 
      Health Insurance Service in South Korea. METHODS: Data (demographic, diagnostic, 
      laboratory, and survival) from 4674 patients undergoing dialysis enrolled in a 
      multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in South Korea between September 2008 
      and December 2012 were linked to phosphate binder use, hospitalization, and cost 
      data available from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. 
      After propensity score matching, a dataset comprising comparable patients treated 
      with either sevelamer (n = 501) or calcium acetate (n = 501) was used in the 
      cost-effectiveness analysis. A Markov model was used to estimate costs, life years, 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness over each patient's 
      lifetime. Forty-month treatment-specific overall survival (OS) data available from 
      the dataset were extrapolated to lifetime survival with the use of regression 
      analysis. FINDINGS: Patients had a mean age of 56.3 years and were treated with 
      dialysis for a mean duration of 67.6 months. Compared with calcium acetate, 
      sevelamer was associated with an incremental cost of South Korean Won (₩) 12,246,911 
      ($10,819) and a gain of 1.758 life years and 1.108 QALYs per patient. This outcome 
      yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ₩6,966,350 ($6154) and ₩11,057,699 
      ($9768) per life year and QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions regarding 
      sevelamer's cost-effectiveness were insensitive to alternative assumptions in time 
      horizon, discount rate, hospitalization rate, costs, and health utility estimates, 
      and they remained consistent in 100% of the model iterations, considering a 
      willingness-to-pay threshold of ₩31,894,720 ($28,176) per QALY gained. IMPLICATIONS: 
      This analysis of real-world data found that sevelamer's higher cost relative to 
      calcium acetate was adequately offset by improved survival among patients undergoing 
      dialysis in South Korea. As such, sevelamer offers good value for money, 
      representing a cost-effective alternative to calcium-based binders.

TI  - Vascular calcification in the uremic patient: a cardiovascular risk?
PG  - S119-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors suggest that the presence of vascular calcification (VC) 
      is associated with a high risk of cardiac events in uremic patients. The aim of this 
      study was to analyze the influence of VC on cardiac morbidity and mortality in our 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We studied 79 patients on HD: 43 males, mean 
      age 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. The presence of VC was 
      evaluated by radiologic series. Other cardiovascular risk factors analyzed were 
      arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cigarette smoking, anemia, and 
      dyslipidemia. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler 
      echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. During this time, clinical 
      information collected included predialysis blood pressure, incidence of ischemic 
      heart disease, episodes of congestive heart failure, and mortality due to 
      cardiovascular event. RESULTS: VC was observed in 55.7% of patients. Left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac valve calcification were 
      significantly associated with VC. Ischemic heart disease (71.4% vs. 28.6%) and 
      episodes of cardiac failure (0.41 vs. 0.18 per year; P < 0.05) appeared more 
      frequently in the patient group with VC. VC was present in 80.6% of patients who 
      developed episodes of heart failure. Eight patients died from cardiac disease; each 
      of them had VC. CONCLUSION: The presence of VC can help to identify those HD 
      patients with a higher cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Association of severity of conjunctival and corneal calcification with all-cause 
      1-year mortality in maintenance haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1016-23
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq485 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is the most common form of 
      metastatic calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The aim of this 
      study is to investigate if severity of CCC correlates with vascular calcification 
      and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. METHODS: One hundred and 
      nine MHD patients were recruited. CCC was evaluated by external eye photographs, and 
      was graded and scored according to modified Porter and Crombie classification system 
      described by Tokuyama et al. Chest X-ray examination was used to evaluate aortic 
      arch calcification. Geographic, haematological, biochemical and dialysis-related 
      data were obtained. The patients were analysed for traditional and non-traditional 
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease stratified by severity of CCC. All patients 
      were followed up for 1 year to investigate the risks for mortality. RESULTS: 
      Forty-three, 35 and 31 patients had mild (scores ≤ 4), moderate and severe (scores ≥ 
      9) CCC at baseline, respectively. With trend estimation, patients with severe CCC 
      had a significantly higher percentage of severe aortic arch calcification. Multiple 
      linear regression analysis showed that hypertension, haemodialysis duration and 
      corrected calcium level were associated with scores of CCC in MHD patients. 
      Moreover, age, corrected calcium-phosphate level, and moderate and severe CCC were 
      associated with grades of aortic arch calcification. At 1-year follow-up, 11 of 109 
      (10.1%) patients had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that 
      age, corrected calcium and severe CCC were significant risk factors for all-cause 
      1-year mortality in MHD patients. Each increment of one score of CCC is associated 
      with a 26.4% increased risk for all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of CCC, 
      which is easily obtained at bedside, acts as an independent predictor for all-cause 
      1-year mortality in MHD patients.

TI  - Association between free light chain levels, and disease progression and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2058-73
LID - 10.3390/toxins5112058 [doi]
AB  - Immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) form part of the middle molecule group of 
      uremic toxins. Accumulation of FLCs has been observed in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). The aim of the present study was to measure FLC levels in 
      patients at different CKD stages and to assess putative associations between FLC 
      levels on one hand and biochemical/clinical parameters and mortality on the other. 
      One hundred and forty patients at CKD stages 2-5D were included in the present 
      study. Routine clinical biochemistry assays and assays for FLC kappa (κ) and lambda 
      (λ) and other uremic toxins were performed. Vascular calcification was evaluated 
      using radiological techniques. The enrolled patients were prospectively monitored 
      for mortality. Free light chain κ and λ levels were found to be elevated in CKD 
      patients (especially in those on hemodialysis). Furthermore, FLC κ and λ levels were 
      positively correlated with inflammation, aortic calcification and the levels of 
      various uremic toxins levels. A multivariate linear regression analysis indicated 
      that FLC κ and λ levels were independently associated with CKD stages and β2 
      microglobulin levels. Elevated FLC κ and λ levels appeared to be associated with 
      mortality. However, this association disappeared after adjustment for a propensity 
      score including age, CKD stage and aortic calcification. In conclusion, our results 
      indicate that FLC κ and λ levels are elevated in CKD patients and are associated 
      with inflammation, vascular calcification and levels of other uremic toxins. The 
      observed link between elevated FLC levels and mortality appears to depend on other 
      well-known factors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian 
      patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF). METHODS: 
      Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. Predictors of 
      patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency rates. RESULTS: 
      Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 
      months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Univariate analysis 
      showed that factors which predict for patency include male gender (p = 0.003), good 
      diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031), pre-dialysis status (p = 
      0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and non-calcified radial arteries (p = 
      0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 
      0.472) did not predict for primary AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the 
      male gender to be an independent predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). 
      Subset analysis showed a significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 
      mm amongst males, as compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no 
      statistical difference in the average cephalic vein diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Within 
      our Asian study population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 
      58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Male 
      gender is an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. In females or patients with 
      calcified radial arteries, a more proximal AVF should be considered.

TI  - Phosphate overload accelerates vascular calcium deposition in end-stage renal 
      disease patients.
PG  - iii86-9
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a major problem in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients, with calcification being one of the conspicuous features of 
      arteriosclerotic vessels. In the present study, clinical analysis and in vitro cell 
      culture were used to investigate factors promoting vascular calcification in ESRD 
      patients. The aortic arch calcification score (AACS) was the method used to estimate 
      vascular calcification by evaluation of the simple posterior-anterior view chest 
      X-rays. Factors that relate significantly to vascular calcification and the AACS are 
      the Ca x Pi, age, dialysis period, blood pressure, smoking and diabetes mellitus, 
      but not total cholesterol or triglyceride. The Ca x Pi, which depends on the serum 
      phosphate concentration, is the only specific factor with the possibility for 
      correction in ESRD patients, and so control of serum phosphate concentration is an 
      important factor for reducing vascular calcification. The effects of phosphate 
      overload on calcium deposition in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) using 
      a primary cell culture system were also investigated. hVSMCs were harvested from the 
      radial artery in ESRD patients and it was found that they could secrete 
      extracellular matrix with a high affinity for calcium in a high phosphate medium 
      (Pi=5.4 mg/dl). Therefore, phosphate overload might stimulate the hVSMCs to 
      accelerate the calcium deposition in ESRD patients. These results suggest that the 
      control of phosphate excess is important for prevention of calcium deposition on 
      arteriole walls in ESRD patients.

TI  - Evaluation of aortic calcification with lanthanum carbonate vs. calcium-based 
      phosphate binders in maintenance hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus: an open-label randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 353-60
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12153 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients, especially with diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. No randomized 
      studies have been published regarding the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on VC 
      progression in DM patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 
      lanthanum carbonate on the progression of VC in HD patients with type 2 DM. We 
      conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing LC with calcium carbonate (CC) in 
      43 HD patients at a single dialysis center. Estimations of aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography were performed twice for each patient 
      (at baseline and 12 months). Forty-one patients completed the study (19 LC, 22 CC). 
      When ACI at baseline was ≦0.48 (median of baseline ACI), median change in ACI 
      (Δ%ACI) was 20.44 (11.50-36.80%) in the LC group, and 40.00 (33.30-92.60%) in the CC 
      group (P = 0.026). On the other hand, when ACI at baseline was >0.48, the median 
      change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 6.42 (3.13-24.40%) in the LC group, and 8.08 (5.68-12.20%) 
      in the CC group (P = 1.000). Serum markers of chronic kidney disease-mineral and 
      bone disorder (CKD-MBD), HbA1c, dose of vitamin D analogues, and side-effects of 
      medications did not change in either group throughout the study except int-PTH 
      increased in the LC group. This study indicated that administration of LC inhibited 
      the progression of VC in patients receiving HD for type 2 DM, only in cases of 
      slight VC compared with CC.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification and atherosclerosis at the initiation of hemodialysis 
      in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 360-9
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery 
      calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship 
      between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with 
      ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC 
      and CAP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
      multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
      respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence 
      of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were 
      also evaluated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found 
      in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria 
      and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with 
      age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant 
      for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
      (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high 
      OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP 
      were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk 
      factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be 
      an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong 
      relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.

TI  - The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium concentration 
      among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0139-9 [doi]
LID - 136
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is 
      inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case 
      reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the 
      hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We 
      hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently 
      reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum 
      Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study 
      the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels. METHODS: Using a single-center 
      cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum 
      Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive 
      serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests 
      was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined 
      in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of 
      ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration. RESULTS: 55 % of patients 
      were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a 
      dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 
      0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 
      vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate 
      Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more 
      PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 
      0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time 
      on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067). CONCLUSION: Among HD 
      patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further 
      research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among 
      PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

TI  - Study design and subject baseline characteristics in the ADVANCE Study: effects of 
      cinacalcet on vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1916-23
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet 
      plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the effect of 
      cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of active vitamin D 
      on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis patients. We 
      report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject characteristics. METHODS: 
      ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized, open-label study. Adult 
      haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (intact 
      parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC 
      score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score (>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and 
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin 
      D (cinacalcet group) or flexible dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The 
      study had three phases: screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC 
      scores obtained by cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and 
      weeks 28 and 52. The primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from 
      baseline to Week 52. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or 
      control. Mean age was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 
      36.7 months (range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the 
      Agatston method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score 
      was independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH. 
      Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The 
      ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
      vascular calcification.

AB  - Increased vascular calcification and oxidative stress are considered as extra renal 
      risk factors at the pathogenesis cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). We investigated matrix Gla protein (MGP) (T-138C, Glu60X, Thr83Ala) and 
      Klotho (Cys370Ser) gene polymorphisms, serum MGP levels, and oxidative stress status 
      of 84 CKD patients and 37 healthy controls. The MGP gene Glu60X and Thr83Ala 
      polymorphisms were significantly associated with CKD. The correlation between T-138C 
      genotype of MGP gene, Cys370Ser genotype of Klotho gene, and CKD was not significant 
      (p > 0.05). At the haplotype analysis, the combination of the X allele of Glu60X and 
      the Thr allele of Thr83Ala showed a significantly increased risk of CKD (p < 0.05). 
      X allele, Thr allele, and C allele of T-138C were associated with diabetes mellitus 
      and CKD phenotypes occurring concurrently (p < 0.01). Serum zinc levels were 
      significantly low in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (p = 0.0001). The total 
      comet score frequency of ESRD patients was higher than that of control group (p < 
      0.05). The urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were significantly high in CKD 
      patients (p < 0.05). According to this study, analyzing the distribution of MGP gene 
      and oxidative stress status would be very informative in order to detect their role 
      at CKD.

TI  - Soluble osteopontin and vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification often occurs in patients with uremia. As 
      osteopontin (OPN) is not only involved in the physiological but also the 
      pathological calcification of tissues, OPN may be associated with the pathogenesis 
      of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We examined the 
      expression of OPN in atherosclerotic aortas of HD patients. In addition, we 
      performed a prospective longitudinal study by using CT scans to detect aortic 
      calcifications and by measuring the plasma OPN concentration by ELISA in HD patients 
      (20 men, 16 women; mean age 55.2 +/- 21.3 years) and in healthy volunteers (18 men, 
      17 women; mean age 54.0 +/- 13.2 years). RESULTS: By immunohistochemical staining, 
      OPN was abundantly localized in atherosclerotic plaques of HD patients. The 
      macrophages surrounding the atheromatous plaques were identified as the 
      OPN-expressing cells. We furthermore found that the concentration of soluble plasma 
      OPN was significantly higher in HD patients as compared with the concentrations in 
      age-matched healthy volunteers (837.3 +/- 443.2 vs. 315.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml, p < 
      0.01). The OPN concentration was positively correlated with the aortic calcification 
      index in HD patients (r = 0.749, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that OPN, 
      secreted by macrophages, plays a role in the calcification of atheromatous plaques 
      in HD patients.

TI  - Effects of age, sex, and polycystic disease on progressive bone disease of renal 
      failure.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - A study of 150 patients undergoing haemodialysis has shown that age had a striking 
      effect on the radiological presentation of renal bone disease, erosions being common 
      in the young and uncommon in older patients and vascular calcification showing 
      opposite trends to this. Men aged 20 to 59 years had a greater tendency to develop 
      erosions than did women in this age range. Examination of a group of 53 patients 
      over a period of five years showed that the half time for the development of 
      vascular calcification was 4.6 years, erosions 26.7 years, and fractures 6.9 years. 
      Nine out of 16 polycystic patients matched for age and sex with 50 controls did not 
      develop erosions and had consistently less vascular calcification than the controls 
      when examined over a six-year period.

AB  - Most dialysis patients have coronary artery disease at the initiation of dialysis 
      therapy and these patients also have marked vascular calcification. Virtual 
      histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) provides coronary tissue maps that are 
      color coded by four major plaque components and facilitate the characterization of 
      coronary plaque composition in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify coronary 
      plaque characteristics in dialysis patients using VH-IVUS. Twenty-three patients 
      with coronary artery disease were included in this study. Of these, 12 patients had 
      normal renal function or mild renal insufficiency (control group) and 11 patients 
      were receiving maintenance dialysis therapy (hemodialysis group). We performed 
      coronary angiography and VH-IVUS analysis on culprit lesions of all patients in the 
      study. The result of VH-IVUS analysis showed that the hemodialysis group had a 
      greater plaque volume, lower percentage of fibrous plaque, and higher percentage of 
      dense calcium plaque compared with the control group. In addition, the serum 
      phosphate levels were significantly associated with the percentage of necrotic core 
      and dense calcium plaque in all study patients. Our findings suggest that the amount 
      of necrotic core and dense calcium plaques increase significantly in hemodialysis 
      patients, and that disordered mineral metabolism may be associated with coronary 
      plaque morphology.

      CaHPO4, MgHPO4) and the enzyme activities (Amylase, Lipase, AP, ACE, GOT, GPT, 
      psi-ChE, CK, gamma-GT, LDH) were investigated in 13 haemodialysed children, 7 
      kidney-transplanted children and in 15 healthy controls. This study confirmed that 
      the kidney plays an important role in the metabolism of hormones. Prior to kidney 
      transplantation 8 of the 11 tested hormone levels of haemodialysed children 
      significantly differed from those of healthy controls, however, after kidney 
      transplantation only two parameters did. The effect of dialysis is the least on the 
      CaHPO4 complex among the different inorganic phosphate complexes. This may play a 
      role in vascular calcification in chronic renal failure patients. The amylase and 
      lipase activity were elevated in haemodialysed group, while in kidney-transplanted 
      children the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) 
      differed from those of the control group.

TI  - Improvement in lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease by nocturnal 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 225-9
AB  - A 42-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was referred for conversion to 
      nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) therapy from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) therapy 
      because of refractory intermittent claudication secondary to peripheral arterial 
      disease (PAD). The patient was initiated on CHD therapy in 1976 and subsequently had 
      undergone two unsuccessful renal transplantations. While on CHD therapy, his 
      clinical course was complicated by worsening vascular and soft-tissue calcification. 
      Extensive dystrophic soft-tissue calcification was noted bilaterally in his hands, 
      lower extremities, and sacral region, requiring surgical excision. Lower-extremity 
      arterial Doppler scans documented vascular calcification and a pronounced decrease 
      in peripheral arterial flow bilaterally. After conversion to NHD therapy (7.5 
      h/session five times weekly), the patient became symptom free and had significant 
      clinical improvements in (1) hemodynamics, measured by clinic blood pressure and 
      two-dimensional echocardiography, (2) biochemical profile, and (3) a sustained 
      improvement in arterial Doppler flow measured by duplex Doppler ultrasound. We 
      conclude that NHD was able to improve lower-extremity PAD in our patient. Further 
      observational and interventional studies are required to investigate the therapeutic 
      potential of NHD for the treatment of PAD in patients with ESRD.

TI  - Peripheral microcirculatory blood flow in haemodialysis patients treated with 
      erythropoietin.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis patients have abnormal blood vessels, and increased 
      morbidity from vascular causes, effects which may potentially be enhanced by 
      erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. METHODS: Microcirculatory blood flow was assessed 
      using a laser-Doppler flowmeter in a group of 19 haemodialysis patients before and 
      during treatment with recombinant human (EPO). RESULTS: Haemodialysis patients had 
      significantly impaired microcirculatory blood flow under both basal (25 degrees C) 
      and hyperaemic (44 degrees C) conditions by comparison with 19 normal controls 
      (baseline flow, median and range: patients 1.54 (0.28-2.54) volts, controls 3.39 
      (0.94-5.23) volts, p < 0.001 Mann Whitney U Test; hyperaemic flow, patients 2.69 
      (1.08-3.82) volts, controls 3.81 (1.32-8.00) volts, p < 0.001). There was no 
      significant influence on microcirculatory blood flow of patient age, duration of 
      haemodialysis, short-term EPO therapy (subcutaneous or intravenous), therapy with a 
      calcium-channel blocker/vasodilator (nifedipine), or radiological evidence of 
      vascular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Haemodialysis patients have an abnormal 
      peripheral microvasculature, which may be relevant to their increased risk of 
      ischaemic tissue damage and poor wound healing.

TI  - Is low magnesium a clue to arteriovenous fistula complications in hemodialysis?
PG  - 773-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1207-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnesium insufficiency is a pro-atherogenic factor involved in endothelial 
      dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and vascular calcification. Our aim was to examine the 
      role of magnesium in the development of arteriovenous fistula complications in 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical investigation of data from 
      88 patients who were divided into two groups: those with and without arteriovenous 
      fistula complications. We examined the influence of sex, demographics, and clinical 
      and laboratory parameters. The existence of fistula stenosis was determined by 
      measuring Doppler flow, while B-mode ultrasound was used to detect plaques and 
      evaluate the carotid artery intima-media thickness. RESULTS: Patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications had significantly higher leukocyte counts (p = 
      0.03), platelet counts (p = 0.03), phosphate concentrations (p = 0.044), and 
      alkaline phosphatase concentrations (p = 0.04). Patients without complications had 
      significantly greater blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula (p < 0.0005), 
      higher magnesium concentrations (p = 0.004), and a lower carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (p = 0.037). The magnesium level was inversely correlated with leukocyte 
      (p = 0.028) and platelet (p = 0.016) counts. The magnesium concentration was 
      significantly lower in patients with carotid artery plaques (p = 0.03). Multiple 
      linear regression, using magnesium as the dependent variable in patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications, indicated statistically significant 
      correlations with platelet (p = 0.005) and leukocyte (p = 0.027) counts and carotid 
      plaques (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Hypomagnesemia is a significant pro-atherogenic 
      factor and an important predictor of arteriovenous fistula complications.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of vascular calcification in pre-dialysis patients with 
      Balkan endemic nephropathy.
PG  - 608-14
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcifications (VC) are common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease and present one of manifestations of mineral and bone disorders in 
      these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the prevalence 
      and risk factors of VC in pre-dialysis patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy 
      (BEN) and other kidney diseases. METHODS: The study involved 32 pre-dialysis 
      patients, 15 with BEN and 17 with other kidney diseases. All the patients underwent 
      an interview, objective examination, routine laboratory analyses and measurement of 
      serum concentration of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 
      [25(OH)D3] and osteopontin. VCs in iliac, femoral, radial, and digital arteries were 
      evaluated and Adragao VC score was calculated. The samples of radial artery were 
      collected during the first creation of an arteriovenous fistula, and expression of 
      osteocalcin, bone morphogenic protein-2 osteopontin, and matrix Gla-protein in 
      arterial wall were examined. RESULTS: Patients with BEN were significantly older 
      (71.1 ± 6.1 vs. 54.7 ± 11.1 years), but they had significantly lower systolic and 
      mean blood pressure (95.7 ± 13.2 mmHg vs. 104.3 ± 7.4 mmHg) and lower serum 
      concentration of phosphorus (1.32 ± 0.36 mmol/l vs. 1.65 ± 0.35 mmol/l) and 
      cholesterol (4.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l vs. 5.2 ± 0.8 mmol/l) than patients with other kidney 
      diseases. Mean VC score was significantly lower in patients with BEN than in those 
      with other kidney diseases (2.8 ± 1.7 vs. 4.6 ± 1.8; p = 0.009), but expression of 
      four examined proteins in arterial wall differed insignificantly between the two 
      groups. VC score correlated significantly with serum concentrations of cholesterol, 
      triglycerides (positively), and iPTH (negatively). CONCLUSION: Pre-dialysis BEN 
      patients had a significantly lower mean score of VC than patients with other kidney 
      diseases.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of sevelamer hydrochloride in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease: a retrospective study.
PG  - 263-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) is frequently used as a second-line 
      phosphate binder in patients on renal replacement therapy. Many studies have shown 
      that sevelamer can improve vascular calcification, serum uric acid and low-density 
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The main objectives of this study were to 
      assess the efficacy of sevelamer against calcium-based phosphate binders, as well as 
      its tolerability and side-effect profile. METHODS: This was a retrospective study 
      that included all patients on renal replacement therapy (between 2008 and 2011) who 
      had previously received calcium-based binders for ≥ 6 months and were subsequently 
      switched to sevelamer. Data collected from the patients' medical records included 
      demographics, as well as renal parameters three months prior to sevelamer treatment, 
      and at three and six months post treatment. The study excluded patients on multiple, 
      concomitant phosphate binders or with functioning renal transplants, and those who 
      were noncompliant or had inadequate follow-up blood investigations. RESULTS: A total 
      of 39 patients were included in the study. No major side effects were reported by 
      any of the patients. There were improvements in calcium, phosphate, uric acid and 
      LDL cholesterol levels at three and six months post-sevelamer treatment. CONCLUSION: 
      We found sevelamer to be superior to calcium-based phosphate binders in reducing 
      serum calcium, phosphate, uric acid and LDL cholesterol levels in our patient 
      population with advanced renal bone disease. Sevelamer also appears to be well 
      tolerated with no significant side effects.

TI  - Assessment of vascular calcification in ESRD patients using spiral CT.
PG  - 1152-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients have increased vascular calcification of the coronary 
      arteries and aorta by electron beam CT scan. The purpose of the present study was to 
      utilize an alternative machine, spiral CT, to assess calcification in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: Two groups of patients with ESRD were 
      evaluated: group 1, those receiving a renal transplant (n=38); and group 2, those 
      remaining on dialysis (n=33). All patients underwent quad-slice spiral CT with 
      retrospective gating to evaluate coronary artery and aorta calcification scores. 
      Both area (Agatston method) and volume calculations were utilized, with 
      retrospective gating in all but 16 subjects. Laboratory tests, medications and 
      clinical characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Using spiral CT, the intra-reader 
      variability for coronary artery calcification (after correction for very low scores) 
      was 0.9% mean / 0% median using the area (Agatston method) and 2.9% mean / 0% median 
      using volume calculations. Group 1 patients were younger, more likely to be 
      Caucasian and on peritoneal dialysis, had lower serum calcium and higher C-reactive 
      protein levels than group 2. In patients without vs those with coronary artery 
      calcification, only longer duration of dialysis (34+/-64 vs 55+/-50 months, P=0.004; 
      r=0.39, P=0.005) and increasing age (39+/-13 vs 54+/-10 years, P<0.001; r=0.29, 
      P=0.039) were associated, whereas only increasing age was associated with aorta 
      calcification. CONCLUSION: In ESRD patients, the factors correlating with coronary 
      calcification were duration of dialysis and advancing age, whereas only age 
      correlated with aorta calcification. Spiral CT offers an alternative technique for 
      the assessment of these changes.

TI  - Aortic and mitral valve calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 875-7
AB  - The frequency and aetiology of aortic valve and mitral annular calcification was 
      studied by echocardiography in 87 patients aged 35-70 on maintenance haemodialysis 
      for a mean of 7.5 years (range 0.5-19). Aortic valve calcification (AVC) was found 
      in 24 patients (28%) and mitral annular calcification (MAC) was found in 31 (36%). 
      AVC was severe and produced aortic stenosis in 5 patients with a tricuspid aortic 
      valve (mean age 51.6 years), which confirms that calcific aortic stenosis is a 
      complication of chronic uraemia. MAC was associated with functional mitral stenosis 
      in 1 patient. Premature AVC and MAC were associated with an increased calcium X 
      phosphate product and long-term haemodialysis. There were no significant differences 
      between those patients with aortic stenosis and those with AVC but no stenosis. 
      Patients with AVC had an increased incidence of MAC and vascular calcification. 
      Premature AVC and MAC is frequent in dialysis patients and appears to be related to 
      abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism and to increased mechanical stress on the 
      valve cusps. In a small but important group of patients on long-term dialysis, 
      premature valve calcification is severe and produces aortic stenosis, or less 
      frequently, mitral stenosis.

TI  - Effect of intradialytic versus home-based aerobic exercise training on physical 
      function and vascular parameters in hemodialysis patients: a randomized pilot study.
PG  - 88-99
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.09.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients show reduced physical function and greater risk of 
      increased arterial stiffness because of hypertension, metabolic disturbances, and 
      vascular calcification. Exercise interventions potentially could improve their 
      vascular risk profile. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled pilot clinical study 
      comparing the effects of 6 months of supervised intradialytic exercise training 
      versus home-based exercise training or usual care on physical function and arterial 
      stiffness in hemodialysis patients. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 70 hemodialysis patients 
      from 3 renal units. INTERVENTION: Intradialytic-exercise patients trained 3 times/wk 
      for 6 months on a cycle ergometer and home-based-exercise patients followed a 
      walking program to achieve the same weekly physical activity. Usual-care patients 
      received no specific intervention. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measures 
      were distance traveled during a 6-minute walk test and aortic pulse wave velocity. 
      Secondary outcome measures included augmentation index (augmentation pressure as a 
      percentage of central pulse pressure), peripheral (brachial) and central blood 
      pressures (measured noninvasively using radial tonometry), physical activity, and 
      self-reported physical functioning. Measurements were made at baseline and 6 months. 
      RESULTS: At 6 months, there were no significant differences between changes in 
      6-minute walk test distance (intradialytic exercise, +14%; home-based exercise, 
      +11%; usual care, +5%), pulse wave velocity (intradialytic exercise, -4%; home-based 
      exercise, -2%; usual care, +5%), or any secondary outcome measure. LIMITATIONS: Lack 
      of medication data limited the analysis of vascular parameters in this study. 
      CONCLUSION: There were no differences between intradialytic or home-based exercise 
      training and usual care for either physical function or vascular parameters.

TI  - Total hip bone mass predicts survival in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1116-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone mass measurements are widely used to diagnose osteoporosis and 
      identify patients at risk for fractures. Recent studies have shown that reduced bone 
      mass is also predictive of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in healthy 
      postmenopausal women. Among chronic hemodialysis patients reduced bone mass 
      resulting from the combined effects of age-related factors and renal osteodystrophy 
      has been associated with vascular calcification. In this prospective study, we 
      investigated the ability of bone mass measurements to predict mortality in chronic 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eighty eight patients underwent hip bone mass 
      measurements by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and were followed up for a 
      mean of 3.5 years. Eleven patients received renal transplants and were therefore 
      excluded. Forty of the remaining patients died, predominantly due to cardiovascular 
      causes (43%). RESULT: Cox regression analysis showed patient age, osteoporosis or 
      osteopenia, and baseline average calcium x phosphate product (Ca x P) to be 
      independently predictive of increased mortality. Patients with osteopenia or 
      osteoporosis had a 3.3- and 4.3-fold increased risk of death, respectively. A Ca x P 
      of >or=5.0 mmol2/L2 predicted a threefold increased risk of death. Previous renal 
      transplantation predicted a lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown for 
      the first time that reduced total hip bone mass is an independent predictor of 
      all-cause mortality among chronic hemodialysis patients. Our findings suggest that 
      reduced bone mass and elevated Ca x P may be involved in the pathogenesis of 
      cardiovascular disease in these patients but further research is required to 
      investigate the possible mechanisms for these associations.

TI  - Length of interdialytic interval influences serum calcium and phosphorus 
      concentrations.
PG  - 1643-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher levels of serum phosphorus and calcium are associated with 
      increased haemodialysis (HD) patient mortality. Both of these factors act 
      synergistically to promote vascular smooth muscle differentiation to an 
      osteoblast-like phenotype and subsequent vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the influence of interdialytic interval on serum levels, as 
      well as the influence of oral calcium-based phosphate binder load on the magnitude 
      of the observed differences. METHODS: We studied 100 patients undergoing HD three 
      times per week, over a 2 week period. Haemoglobin, albumin, calcium and phosphate 
      were measured pre-dialysis before each HD session. Oral phosphate binder usage was 
      recorded. All patients were treated with dialysate containing 1.25 mEq/l calcium. 
      RESULTS: Both mean serum phosphate and calcium were higher after the long 
      interdialytic interval (1.59+/-0.05 vs 1.45+/-0.04 mmol/l, P = 0.0005, and 
      2.46+/-0.03 vs 2.4+/-0.02 mmol/l, P = 0.001, for serum phosphate and uncorrected 
      calcium, respectively). There were no significant differences in haemoglobin or 
      serum albumin, indicating that variable dilution from an increased hydration status 
      in the long interdialytic interval was unlikely to contribute to these observed 
      differences. A total of 74 patients were treated with calcium-containing binders and 
      26 patients with sevelamer. Patients on sevelamer did not exhibit the observed 
      cyclical increase in serum calcium seen in patients on calcium-containing binders 
      (mean difference in serum calcium 0.09+/-0.01 mmol/l in the calcium-treated group vs 
      0.01+/-0.01 mmol/l in the sevelamer-treated patients, P = 0.0004). The increase in 
      serum calcium after the long interval as compared with the short interval was 
      proportional to the daily amount of the oral calcium-containing binder load ingested 
      (r = 0.63, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Cyclical differences in interdialytic interval and 
      overall exposure to both dietary phosphate and oral calcium load influence serum 
      levels. This may have consequences for registry reporting, therapy modulation and 
      potentially the pathogenesis of accelerated vascular calcification seen in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin and mortality in hemodialysis patients with cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 161-7
LID - 10.5414/CN107803 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) have an increased mortality, 
      mainly caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a 
      glycoprotein involved in the regulation of the vascular calcification process. 
      Previous studies have demonstrated that OPG is a prognostic marker of mortality. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate if OPG was a prognostic marker of all-cause 
      mortality in high-risk patients with end-stage renal disease and CVD. METHODS: We 
      prospectively followed 206 HD patients with CVD. OPG was measured at baseline and 
      the patients were followed for 2 years or until reaching the primary endpoint, i.e., 
      all-cause mortality. RESULTS: All-cause mortality during follow-up was 44% (90/206). 
      High OPG was associated with increased mortality, using the first tertile as 
      reference, with an unadjusted HR of 1.70 (CI 1.00 - 2.88) for the second tertile and 
      HR of 1.63 (CI 0.96 - 2.78) for the third tertile. In a multivariate Cox-regression 
      analysis age, CRP and OPG in both the second and third tertile were significantly 
      associated with increased mortality In the unadjusted survival analysis, a test for 
      trend of OPG yielded a p-value of 0.08; in the adjusted analyses, the p-value for 
      trend was 0.03. CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk population of hemodialysis patients with 
      previously documented cardiovascular disease, a high level of OPG was an independent 
      risk marker of all-cause mortality.

TI  - Aortic pulse wave velocity in haemodialysis patients is associated with the 
      prescription of active vitamin D analogues.
PG  - 431-7
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0040-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death for 
      haemodialysis patients. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
      haemodialysis patients have additional risk factors, including vascular 
      calcification. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measurement of arterial stiffness, and 
      we wished to determine whether PWV is affected by different factors in haemodialysis 
      patients compared to the general population. METHODS: Aortic PWV was measured in 303 
      adult patients attending for routine outpatient dialysis. RESULTS: 303 patients, 
      63.4% male, mean age 68.5 ± 15.8 years, 47.5% diabetic with a body mass index of 
      25.8 ± 5.3 kg/m(2), were studied. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 148.7 ± 28.6 
      mmHg and diastolic 80.4 ± 15.3 mmHg. Aortic PWV was 9.73 ± 2.08 m/s, and was 
      correlated with SBP (β 0.015, F 5.29, p = 0.023), log serum parathyroid hormone 
      (PTH) (β 1.58, F 13.85, p < 0.001) and prescription of alfacalcidol (β -1.11, F 
      6.81, p = 0.010). 197 patients had corresponding ECHO cardiograms, and in this 
      cohort PWV was associated with SBP (β 0.017, F 7.49, p = 0.006), log serum 
      parathyroid hormone (β 0.85, F 5.99, p < 0.015) and prescription of alfacalcidol (β 
      -0.8, F 4.18, p = 0.042), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (β 0.01, F 11.4, p = 
      0.001), and log serum triglycerides (β 1.43, F 4.79, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found that PWV, a measurement of arterial stiffness, was associated with both 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including SBP and LVMI, but also 
      non-traditional risk factors such as prescription of active vitamin D analogues,

TI  - Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with arterial stiffness and vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the most frequent cardiac abnormality in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Recent studies have shown that 
      arterial stiffness is associated with mediacalcinosis in these patients. However, 
      whether arterial stiffness and vascular calcification are associated with the LVH in 
      patients with ESRD has not been well established. Forty-nine patients on chronic 
      hemodialysis participated in this study. 1) To better understand the mechanism 
      underlying the increased incidence of LVH, we studied the relation between LVH and 
      each of arterial wall stiffness, aortic calcification, and numerous clinical 
      parameters in 49 patients on chronic hemodialysis. 2) To evaluate the contribution 
      of arterial stiffness and arterial calcification to LVH in hemodialysis patients, we 
      performed the present clinical analysis on 49 patients on chronic hemodialysis. We 
      used an automatic device to measure arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) as an index 
      of arterial wall stiffness. The aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantified 
      morphometrically by CT scan. The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was estimated by 
      M-mode echocardiography. To understand the mechanism underlying the increased 
      incidence of LVH, we examined the factors contributing to LVMI in these patients. 
      The correlation between each of the study parameters and LVMI as an indicator of LVH 
      was then examined. The LVMI value was correlated positively with PWV (r=0.439, 
      p=0.0014), systolic blood pressure (r=0.421, p=0.0023), and ACI (r=0.467, p=0.0006). 
      A stepwise linear regression analysis showed that PWV, systolic blood pressure, and 
      ACI were independently associated with LVH in our subjects. These results suggest 
      that LVH is associated with hypertension, increased arterial stiffness, and the 
      extent of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, with vascular 
      calcification being the most important contributor to the development of LVH. 
      Alteration of pulsatile dynamics contributes to an increase in left ventricular load 
      and thus is also related to the LVH in these patients. These results suggest that 
      LVH is associated with hypertension, increased arterial stiffness, and the extent of 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. Vascular calcification, which 
      alters the pulsatile dynamics and thereby contributes to an increase in left 
      ventricular load, is the most important contributor to the development of LVH in 
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.

TI  - Assessment of survival in a 2-year comparative study of lanthanum carbonate versus 
      standard therapy.
PG  - 3021-8
LID - 10.1185/03007990903399398 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological data link elevated levels of serum phosphorus with 
      increased mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent data also 
      suggest improved survival with the use of dietary phosphate binders in patients on 
      dialysis. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the survival benefit 
      associated with different phosphate binders. A post-hoc survival analysis was 
      undertaken of lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol *) versus standard therapy. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients on dialysis enrolled in a phase 3, 2-year, comparative 
      safety study were randomized 1:1 to lanthanum carbonate or standard therapy to treat 
      serum phosphorus to a target of < or =5.9 mg/dL (1.90 mmol/L). Patients (N = 1354) 
      were followed up for survival status during, or after completion of or 
      discontinuation from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival was measured by time 
      from first dose of study medication to all-cause mortality or last contact. RESULTS: 
      The distribution of follow-up time was similar in the lanthanum carbonate and 
      standard therapy groups (mean 23.7 versus 23.9 months [median 27.0 versus 26.0 
      months], respectively). Serum phosphorus levels were similar across treatment 
      groups, as patients were treated to target. At follow-up, 19.9% (135/680) of 
      patients treated with lanthanum carbonate had died versus 23.3% (157/674) on 
      standard therapy (log-rank p = 0.18). In the subgroup of patients aged >65 years (n 
      = 336), 27.0% (44/163) of lanthanum-carbonate-treated patients had died compared 
      with 39.3% (68/173) on standard therapy (log-rank p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In these 
      survival analyses, overall mortality was similar in the lanthanum carbonate and 
      standard therapy groups, but results suggest that there was a survival benefit 
      associated with lanthanum carbonate treatment for patients aged >65 years, who are 
      likely to carry the greatest burden of vascular calcification. These results were 
      similar to those observed in the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study, a 
      prospective trial of sevelamer hydrochloride designed to assess survival.

      mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 419-25
LID - 10.1159/000294405 [doi]
AB  - Many traditional and nontraditional risk factors contribute to vascular 
      calcification among maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. It is not clear whether 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) delineates a higher mortality risk independent 
      of known risk factors. We examined 6-year (10/2001-9/2007) survival of 166 MHD 
      patients, aged 53 +/- 13 years, with baseline CAC scores. Patients were grouped into 
      four CAC groups: 0, 1-100, 101-400, and 400+. The 101-400 and 400+ groups were 
      associated with a significantly higher adjusted risk of death than CAC 0 with hazard 
      ratios (HR) 8.5 (95% CI: 1.1-48.1, p = 0.02) and 13.3 (95% CI: 1.3-65.1, p = 0.01), 
      respectively, independent of demographics, comorbidity, lipids and other 
      cardiovascular risks, surrogates of bone disease, nutritional and inflammatory 
      markers and dialysis dose. Total CAC [HR 6.7 (1.1-21.5, p = 0.03)] followed by the 
      presence of CAC in the left main [4.6 (2.2-9.8, p = 0.001)] and left anterior 
      descending artery [4.3 (2.1-14.2, p = 0.001)] were strong independent predictors of 
      mortality even after adjusting for above covariates. Total and vessel-specific CAC 
      predict mortality in MHD patients independent of traditional and nontraditional risk 
      factors.

TI  - Effects of calcium-containing phosphate binders on cardiovascular events and 
      mortality in predialysis CKD stage 5 patients.
PG  - e0241435
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0241435 [doi]
LID - e0241435
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphatemia and calcium load were associated with vascular 
      calcification. The role of calcium-containing phosphate binders (CCPBs) use as 
      important determinants of death and cardiovascular events in predialysis 
      hyperphosphatemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients remain unclear due to the 
      absence of evidence for reduced mortality with CCPB use compared with placebo. We 
      aimed to investigate the effect of using CCPBs or nonuse in all-cause mortality 
      rates and cardiovascular events in CKD stage 5 patients between 2000 and 2005 in the 
      Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. METHODS: Patients with known 
      coronary heart disease and those who had undergone dialysis or renal transplantation 
      were excluded. The CCPB users were matched with nonusers by the propensity score 
      model. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard 
      ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: During a 
      mean follow-up of 4.58 years, 879 CCPB users were matched with 3516 nonusers. CCPB 
      use was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [adjusted hazard ratio 
      (HR) 1.583, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.393-1.799]. The increased cardiovascular 
      risk was dose-dependent and consistent across all subgroup analyses. Compared with 
      no use, CCPB use was associated with no significant all-cause mortality risk (1.74 
      vs. 1.75 events per 100 person-years, adjusted HR 0.964, 95% CI 0.692-1.310). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CCPB use in CKD stage 5 patients was associated with a significantly 
      increased cardiovascular event risk compared with the nonusers, whereas the 
      all-cause mortality risk was similar between the two groups. Whether these 
      relationships are causal require further randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and associated factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 395-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and 
      is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular 
      calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, 
      and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in 
      a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the 
      recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative 
      guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a 
      sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level 
      (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' 
      characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 
      and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; 
      and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% 
      and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, 
      and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 
      6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant 
      treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as 
      a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 
      66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 
      21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a 
      higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < 
      .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage 
      levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, 
      normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip 
      bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were 
      significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol 
      deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated 
      factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher 
      intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy 
      of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D 
      supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need 
      for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and 
      the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification in dialysis patients: results of the CORD study.
PG  - 4009-15
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn403 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 have a high prevalence of 
      vascular calcification, but the specific anatomical distribution and severity of 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), in contrast to coronary calcification, is less 
      well documented. AAC may be recorded using plain radiographs. The present report is 
      an analysis of baseline data on AAC in patients enrolled in the CORD (Calcification 
      Outcome in Renal Disease) study. METHODS: A total of 47 centres in six European 
      countries participated in this cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria were age 
      >or=18 years and duration of dialysis >or=3 months. Lateral lumbar radiography of 
      the abdominal aorta was used to determine the overall AAC score, which is related to 
      the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1-L4. The 
      reliability of the method was tested by double reading of 64 radiographs 
      (coefficient of correlation 0.9). RESULTS: A lateral lumbar radiograph was obtained 
      in 933 patients. Calcification (AAC score >or= 1) was present in 81% of the 
      patients; its severity increased significantly from L1 to L4 (P < 0.0001) and 
      affected all of these segments in 51% of patients. Independent predictors for the 
      presence and severity of calcification were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.103/year; P < 
      0.0001), duration of dialysis (OR 1.110/year; P = 0.002) and history of 
      cardiovascular disease (OR 3.247; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: AAC detected by lateral 
      lumbar radiograph is associated with several risk factors of uraemic calcification. 
      This semi-quantitative method is more widely available and less expensive than the 
      current procedures for studying calcification and could form part of a 
      pre-transplant workup and cardiovascular risk stratification.

TI  - Gene polymorphisms and serum alpha-2-Heremans-Schmid levels in Italian haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 639-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) and accelerated atherosclerosis are major 
      causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Inhibitory proteins are associated with reduced VC and may play a key role 
      in preventing CV in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Fetuin-A, also known as 
      alpha(2)-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), is a circulating plasma protein with 
      inhibitory effects on VC that has been associated with inflammation and CV mortality 
      in HD patients. In the present study, we investigated the associations between serum 
      fetuin-A levels and its gene (AHSG) polymorphisms in an Italian HD population. 
      METHODS: Ninety-six patients on stable chronic HD treatment and 57 healthy controls 
      were genotyped for the common polymorphisms on the AHSG (T256S). In addition, serum 
      fetuin-A levels were tested. RESULTS: In this study, serum fetuin-A levels were 
      lower in HD patients (0.35 +/- 0.11 g/l) compared with healthy controls (0.62 +/- 
      0.31 g/l, p < 0.05). In both HD patients and the control group, the distribution of 
      the AHSG gene did not show significant association between low serum fetuin-A levels 
      and the Ser/Ser genotype, known to be associated with a higher CV mortality risk in 
      the HD population. Moreover, the distribution of AHSG gene polymorphisms in HD 
      patients and in healthy controls was similar. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous 
      reports, this study suggests that CKD patients on HD treatment have a similar 
      polymorphism distribution of the AHSG gene compared with the normal population and 
      that the reduction in serum fetuin-A levels in Italian HD patients is not associated 
      with an alteration in the distribution of AHSG T256S polymorphisms.

TI  - Inverse association of diabetes and dialysis with the severity of femoropopliteal 
      lesions and chronic total occlusion: a cross-sectional study of 2056 cases.
PG  - 514
LID - 10.1186/s12872-020-01805-6 [doi]
LID - 514
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to reveal the association of diabetes mellitus and 
      dialysis-dependent renal failure with the lesion severity and chronic total 
      occlusion (CTO) in patients undergoing femoropopliteal endovascular therapy for 
      intermittent claudication. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study analyzed 
      the data of 2056 consecutive patients with moderate to severe intermittent 
      claudication, who underwent endovascular therapy for de novo lesions in the 
      superficial femoral artery to the proximal popliteal artery between 2010 and 2018 at 
      five cardiovascular centers in Japan. The association of the clinical 
      characteristics with severity of the lesions, as assessed by the Trans-Atlantic 
      Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification, was investigated using the ordinal 
      logistic regression model. Their association with CTO, lesion length, and severity 
      of calcifications was additionally analyzed using the binomial logistic regression 
      model. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and dialysis-dependent renal 
      failure was 54.7% and 21.4%, respectively; 12.5% of the patients had lesions 
      corresponding to TASC II class D, and 39.3% of the patients had CTO. Current smoking 
      and severe claudication were associated with more severe lesions assessed according 
      to the TASC II classification; diabetes mellitus and dialysis dependence were 
      inversely associated with disease severity. The adjusted odds ratios of diabetes 
      mellitus and dialysis dependence were 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.70-0.97; 
      p = 0.018) and 0.76 (0.62-0.94; p = 0.009), respectively. Diabetes mellitus and 
      dialysis dependence were also inversely associated with CTO (both p < 0.05). 
      Furthermore, diabetes mellitus was inversely associated with a long lesion 
      (p < 0.05). Diabetes mellitus and dialysis dependence were positively associated 
      with severe calcification (both p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus and 
      dialysis-dependent renal failure were inversely associated with the lesion severity, 
      as assessed by the TASC II classification, and CTO in patients undergoing 
      femoropopliteal endovascular therapy for intermittent claudication.

TI  - Soft tissue calcification in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - Soft tissue calcification is a recognized complication of uremia in adult patients 
      and has been implicated as a cause of ischemic necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and 
      respiratory failure. However, soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in 
      pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an 
      adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, 
      biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following 
      renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 
      1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). 
      Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most 
      frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, 
      coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification 
      was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had 
      small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue 
      calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of 
      vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak 
      calcium x phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were 
      jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest 
      independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was 
      greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and 
      vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium 
      at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not 
      statistically associated with calcinosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Measurement of vascular calcification using CT fistulograms.
PG  - 484-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC), precipitated by calcium and phosphate 
      imbalance, is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) quantitatively assesses 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC), with VC scores predictive of atherosclerosis 
      and cardiac events in the general and CKD population. EBCT is not readily available 
      but spiral CT can also provide quantitative assessment of the extent of VC. CT 
      fistulograms can be used as initial investigation for arterio-venous fistula (AVF) 
      problems in haemodialysis (HD). The images obtained include thoracic aorta, 
      brachio-cephalic, subclavian and common carotid arteries which allow assessment of 
      the extent of VC in these vessels. No study to date has combined the CT fistulogram 
      with concurrent determination of VC. METHODS: We hypothesize that a single 
      investigation for AVF management may also provide information on VC. We 
      retrospectively analysed CT fistulograms on 28 HD patients determining VC scores (in 
      Hounsfield units) in AVF, subclavian and carotid arteries and aorta. We correlated 
      these scores with patient demographics, serum markers of mineral metabolism (time 
      averaged for the period 6 months prior to CT) and calcium-based phosphate binders. 
      RESULTS: Patients (60.7% male) had a median age of 59 years and 46.4% were diabetic. 
      The mean duration of dialysis was 17.5 months. CT fistulograms showed predominantly 
      aortic (75% of patients) and subclavian (75%) calcifications, with only 21.4% having 
      carotid VC and minimal VC at the level of AVF. Median VC scores were 619.8 
      (0-1481.4) for aorta and 521.7 (0-1139.6) for subclavian (scores of >400 indicate 
      severe atherosclerotic disease), but there was no significant correlation with serum 
      markers or duration of HD. Increasing age correlated significantly with greater VC 
      in aortic (R = 0.53, P = 0.003) and subclavian (R = 0.40, P = 0.03) vessels, as well 
      as with the number of VC sites involved. CAC was present in most patients (89.3%) 
      but CAC scores were not able to be determined because of cardiac movement. 
      CONCLUSION: Concurrent determination of the degree of calcification in certain 
      vessels may be possible from CT studies assessing AVF structure. VC scores provided 
      by CT fistulograms could contribute to HD patient CVD risk assessment but studies 
      with larger patient numbers are required to determine their relevance.

TI  - Peritoneal dialysis per se is a risk factor for sclerostin-associated adynamic bone 
      disease.
PG  - 1039-45
LID - 10.1038/ki.2014.372 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome 
      influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and 
      dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only 
      a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older 
      studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy 
      in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease 
      (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a 
      Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) 
      and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and 
      specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between 
      nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, 
      and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone 
      mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic 
      bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. 
      Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and 
      bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these 
      patients.

AB  - We examined the influence of cinacalcet on vascular calcification by measuring the 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in hemodialysis patients who received 
      cinacalcet. The cinacalcet treatment group consisted of eight hemodialysis patients 
      with secondary hyperparathyroidism who received cinacalcet for 7-14 months. The mean 
      CACS change in the treatment group was -0.094/year, showing a decreasing tendency, 
      while that in the control group showed an increasing tendency of 0.034/year. The 
      mean CACS change showed a tendency for improvement in the treatment group, but no 
      significant difference from that in the control group was observed as the number of 
      cases was small (P = 0.102). The results of this study suggest that cinacalcet is 
      effective in preventing the progress of extraosseous calcification.

      patients: a five-year follow-up study.
PG  - 33-8
LID - 10.1159/000357639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone loss is common among hemodialysis patients and contributes to 
      mortality. The association between bone loss and vascular calcification may explain 
      the increased mortality risk. Studies on the association between decreased bone mass 
      and mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients are limited. METHODS: 
      Eighty-three hemodialysis patients underwent bone mineral density (BMD) and coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) measurements. The relationship between BMD and mortality 
      was analyzed after a 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the 
      patients had reduced hip BMD. In univariate Cox regression analyses, age, 
      cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, increased CAC score, increased comorbidity 
      score and decreased hip BMD were associated with mortality. Low hip BMD remained 
      independently associated with mortality after adjustments for cardiovascular risk 
      factors, comorbidity score and CAC score. Patients with BMD in the lowest tertile 
      had the worst survival. CONCLUSION: Low hip BMD predicted mortality in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients independent of CAC.

TI  - Evaluation of atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and related risk factors in 
      chronic hemodialysis patients in Siriraj Hospital.
PG  - S117-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Additional to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
      recent evidence demonstrates that nontraditional risk factors such as high-sensitive 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular calcification may 
      cause progressive atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aim to 
      determine the prevalence of atherosclerosis and assess the arterial stiffness and 
      related risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Common carotid artery intima-media 
      thicknesses (CIMT), atherosclerotic plaque occurrence were determined by B-mode 
      ultrasonography in 105 hemodialysis patients (mean age, 53 +/- 15.5 years; mean 
      dialysis duration 82 +/- 59.5 months). A history of clinically significant 
      atherosclerotic vascular disease was elicited by patient questionnaire and verified 
      by careful patient chart review and physical examination. Cardiovascular ankle index 
      (CAVI) was use to assess arterial stiffness. Serum biochemical marker for 
      traditional risk factors, hsCRP and homocysteine were measured by standard method. 
      RESULTS: Atherosclerotic vascular disease (defined by a history of CVD or presence 
      of atherosclerotic plaque) was present in 79% of patients. Compared to 
      non-atherosclerotic group, the mean CIMT and serum hsCRP in atherosclerotic group 
      was higher (1.9 +/- 0.8 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.6 mm, p < 0.001; 6.5 +/- 8.8 mg/L vs. 3.3 
      +/- 3.5 mg/L, p = 0.03, respectively), while other biochemical markers were not 
      significantly different, as well as the percentage of abnormal CAVI (69% vs. 54.5%, 
      p = 0.28). CAVI was positively correlated with maximum carotid intima-meida 
      thickness (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). CAVI was also significantly greater in patients 
      with carotid plaque (soft plaque (p < 0.05) and calcified plaque (p < 0.05)) 
      compared with patients without carotid plaque. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of 
      atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness was observed in hemodialysis patients. 
      Carotid atherosclerosis is associated with an increased inflammatory marker (hsCRP). 
      CAVI may be a useful index to assess arterial stiffness and associated with arterial 
      intima-media thickness.

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla Protein, Arterial Stiffness, and Endothelial Function in African 
      American Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 735-741
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vascular calcification inhibitor dependent 
      upon vitamin K for activation. Evidence suggests that elevated plasma inactive MGP 
      levels (desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP, dp-ucMGP; indicating poorer vascular vitamin 
      K status) are associated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Despite 
      African Americans experiencing highest rates of kidney failure and CVD events, 
      relationships between dp-ucMGP and CVD risk markers have not been examined in this 
      population. We investigated vascular vitamin K status (via plasma dp-ucMGP) between 
      African American hemodialysis (HD) patients and healthy controls, and the 
      associations of dp-ucMGP with arterial stiffness and endothelial function in HD 
      patients only. METHODS: In 37 African American HD patients and 37 age- and 
      race-matched controls, plasma dp-ucMGP was measured by enzyme immunoassay as a 
      marker of vascular vitamin K status. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV; 
      arterial stiffness measurement) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD; 
      endothelial function measurement) were assessed by applanation tonometry and 
      ultrasound, respectively, in HD patients only. RESULTS: Mean dp-ucMGP levels were 
      5.6 times higher in HD patients vs. controls (2,139 ± 1,102 vs. 382 ± 181 pmol/l, P 
      < 0.01). Multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, dialysis vintage, 
      diabetes mellitus, CVD history, body mass index, and blood pressure, revealed that 
      dp-ucMGP was independently related to PWV (standardized β = 0.49) and FMD 
      (standardized β = -0.53) (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 
      higher plasma dp-ucMGP concentrations found in African American HD patients may be 
      associated with greater arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Vascular calcification is associated with impaired microcirculatory function in 
      chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - c121-6
LID - 10.1159/000114202 [doi]
AB  - Although vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients is associated with 
      increased cardiovascular events, the pathophysiology is still largely obscure. 
      Microcirculatory dysfunction may contribute to demand myocardial ischaemia. We have 
      studied cutaneous microcirculatory function in haemodialysis (HD) patients with and 
      without large-vessel VC. 37 non-diabetic subjects (20 HD and 17 healthy controls) 
      were studied. VC was assessed using CT scanning of a standardised segment of 
      superficial femoral artery (11 VC+, 9 VC-). Laser Doppler imaging was undertaken 
      using a Periscan PIM II(R) at rest and under vasodilator challenge. Baseline 
      perfusion was not statistically different in VC+ patients than VC- patients or 
      controls (1.03 +/- 0.2, 1.08 +/- 0.2, 0.93 +/- 0.3 PU respectively). Overall, the 
      maximum vasodilatory response to both ACh (p < 0.001) and SNP (p = 0.004) was lower 
      in the HD than the control group. In addition, the HD patients took longer to reach 
      a maximum vasodilatation than the controls (p = 0.008 for ACh, n.s. for SNP). 
      Further, the maximum vasodilatory response in the VC+ patients was lower and 
      patients took longer to reach maximum vasodilatation than the VC- group. We have 
      demonstrated, for the first time, impaired and dysregulated microcirculatory 
      function in patients with VC. This may be important in understanding the 
      pathophysiology of the complications and cardiovascular consequences of VC.

      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - c83-8
LID - 10.1159/000319654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca)-P product (Ca × P) are 
      associated with vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity 
      and CVD and all-cause mortality. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of 
      sevelamer hydrochloride exposure (regardless of calcium carbonate exposure) on 
      carotid and femoral intima media thickness (IMT), reliable surrogate measures of 
      prospective intimal thickening, in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study is nested in the Sevelamer 
      hydrochloride and ultrasound-measured femoral and carotid intima media thickness 
      progression in end-stage renal disease (SUMMER) clinical trial. Carotid and femoral 
      arteries were visualized in B-mode ultrasonography. Log-transformed IMT was compared 
      by sevelamer hydrochloride exposure and modeled using multiple linear regression. 
      RESULTS: Forty-five subjects were exposed to sevelamer hydrochloride and 130 were 
      not. Exposed subjects had significantly lower carotid IMT, an association which 
      persisted in the multiple linear regression model even after controlling for 
      potentially confounding variables including serum Ca, history of CVD and body 
      weight. Exposed subjects had lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and 
      significantly higher parathyroid hormone, but no differences in P, Ca and Ca × P. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer hydrochloride was associated with lower carotid IMT. This 
      association may be mediated through reduction in Ca load, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol lowering or some other pleiotropic effect.

TI  - Relationship between fetuin-A, bone turnover and inflammatory markers concentrations 
      in serum of maintenance hemodialyzed patients.
PG  - 799-804
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fetuin-A plays an important role in bone turnover and vascular 
      calcification. AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between 
      serum fetuin-A concentrations, inflammatory and bone turnover markers of patients on 
      maintenance hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed in 71 
      patients (21 women, 40 men) aged 60 ± 12 years on chronic dialysis because of 
      end-stage renal failure for a period of 75 ± 57.2 months. The routine laboratory 
      tests were performed with Modular P analyzer (Roche Diagnostics), serum 
      concentrations of iPTH were measured using Nichols method, hsCRP and IL-6 using 
      nephelometric techniques while fetuin-A, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), 
      fully carboxylated osteocalcin (cOC), undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), and 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) were measured using commercially available 
      ELISA kits. RESULTS: Concentrations of fetuin-A were significantly positively 
      correlated with albumin (r=0.37, p=0.003) and negatively associated with patients 
      age (r=26, p=0.04), log (iPTH) (r=0.31, p=0.02), log (CRP) (r=0.31, p=0.02), log 
      (IL-6) (r=0.41, p=0.001), log (ucOC) (r=-0.29, p=0.02), and log (FGF-23) (r=0.27, 
      p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 1. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis suffer from severe 
      disturbances of bone turnover. 2. Low serum fetuin-A levels are associated with 
      increase markers of bone turnover and inflammation.

TI  - Functional deficiency of vitamin K in hemodialysis patients in Upper Silesia in 
      Poland.
PG  - 765-71
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1255-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Functional vitamin K deficiency (both K1 and K2) is postulated to be one of 
      the most relevant links between chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommended dietary restrictions in HD patients 
      superimposed on diversity of eating habits across the countries may affect the 
      prevalence of functional vitamin K deficiency. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the level of functional vitamin K deficiency and its relation to vitamin 
      K1 intake in HD patients in Upper Silesia in Poland. METHODS: Protein-induced 
      vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) and undercarboxylated matrix Gla 
      protein (ucMGP) were assessed by ELISA in 153 stable, prevalent HD patients and 20 
      apparently healthy adults (to establish normal ranges for PIVKA-II and ucMGP). Daily 
      phylloquinone intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      PIVKA-II and ucMGP levels were increased in 27.5 and 77.1 % of HD patients in 
      comparison with the reference ranges in apparently healthy controls, respectively. 
      In 45 % of cases, the increased PIVKA-II level was explained by insufficient 
      phylloquinone intake for Polish population (recommended intake: >55 μg for women and 
      >65 µg for men). Applying ROC analysis, we showed that vitamin K1 intake below 40.2 
      µg/day was associated with increased PIVKA-II levels. There was no correlation 
      between vitamin K1 intake and plasma concentration of ucMGP, or between PIVKA-II and 
      ucMGP. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Functional vitamin K1 deficiency is explained by low vitamin 
      K1 intake in less than half of HD patients. (2) Undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein 
      level is a poor surrogate for functional vitamin K1 deficiency.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients.

LID - 10.1159/000368476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple 
      assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted a prospective 
      study to investigate factors associated with the presence at baseline and 
      progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a 
      short-term outcome. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 
      asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 
      2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and 
      biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years. 
      RESULTS: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients 
      (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An 
      increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male patients 
      who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years, 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
      calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients 
      with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and the grade of 
      AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates were 
      significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were 
      independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by chest 
      X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD 
      patients.

TI  - Improved assessment of aortic calcification in Japanese patients undergoing 
      maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 2071-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification is a feature of arteriosclerosis and in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients it may be severe, even at a relatively young age, and is 
      closely related to the overall prognosis. We used the aortic calcification area 
      index (ACAI), derived from the aortic calcification index (ACI), to evaluate and 
      analyze the risk factors for abdominal aortic calcification in HD patients. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Subjects comprised 137 patients on maintenance HD. ACAI was measured on 
      abdominal plain computed tomography: 10 slices of the abdominal aorta were obtained 
      at 1-cm intervals from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery and the area of 
      the aortic cross-section and calcification was measured using image software. The 
      calcification area was divided by the cross-sectional area and expressed as a 
      percentage (%). The mean value for the 10 slices was also calculated. Patients were 
      divided into 2 groups according to ACAI being lower or higher than the mean value 
      and the risk factors in each group were compared by multivariate analysis. Results 
      Group comparison showed significant differences in age, systolic blood pressure, 
      serum calcium, and lipoprotein(a). On multiple regression analysis, age, systolic 
      blood pressure, and serum calcium were independent risk factors. On logistic 
      regression analysis, age, duration of dialysis, systolic blood pressure, and serum 
      calcium were independent risk factors. CONCLUSION: Risk factors for abdominal aortic 
      calcification in HD patients include age, systolic blood pressure, and serum 
      calcium, according to ACAI evaluation. The ACAI was accurate and useful for 
      evaluating abdominal calcification.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification is associated with diastolic dysfunction, mortality,

PG  - 870-5
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2012.27.8.870 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the significance of aortic calcification index (ACI), an 
      estimate of abdominal aortic calcification by plain abdominal computed tomography 
      (CT), in terms of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, mortality, and 
      nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events in chronic hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis 
      patients who took both an abdominal CT and echocardiography were divided into a 
      low-ACI group (n = 64) and a high-ACI group (n = 64). The high-ACI group was 
      significantly older, had a longer dialysis vintage and higher comorbidity indices, 
      and more patients had a previous history of CV disease than the low-ACI group. The 
      ACI was negatively correlated with LV end-diastolic volume or LV stroke volume, and 
      was positively correlated with the ratio of peak early transmitral flow velocity to 
      peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E' ratio), a marker of LV diastolic 
      function. The E/E' ratio was independently associated with the ACI. The event-free 
      survival rates for mortality and nonfatal CV events were significantly lower in the 
      high-ACI group compared with those in the low-ACI group, and the ACI was an 
      independent predictor for all-cause deaths and nonfatal CV events. In conclusion, 
      ACI is significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction and predicts all-cause 
      mortality and nonfatal CV events in hemodialysis patients.

      renal disease.
PG  - 938-42
AB  - To test the predictive values of and independent contributions to cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality of various arterial parameters exploring characteristics of the 
      arterial wall at different sites, we studied prospectively 110 stable end-stage 
      renal disease patients on hemodialysis. These parameters involved carotid diameter, 
      carotid intima-media thickness, carotid compliance, carotid distensibility, carotid 
      incremental elastic modulus, aortic diameter, aortic pulse wave velocity, and the 
      presence of arterial calcifications measured at the sites of the carotid artery, 
      abdominal aorta, iliofemoral axis, and legs. The presence of calcifications was 
      analyzed semiquantitatively as a score (0 to 4) according to the number of arterial 
      sites with calcifications. During a follow-up of 53+/-21 months (mean+/-SD), 25 
      cardiovascular and 14 noncardiovascular deaths occurred. In univariate analysis, the 
      carotid incremental elastic modulus was the most closely related to prognosis. Risk 
      of death increased with the number of vascular sites involved by calcifications. 
      Moreover, information (in terms of prediction) given by carotid elastic incremental 
      modulus was additive to the presence and extent of vascular calcification-related 
      prediction value. Adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
      for an increase of 1 unit in calcification score were 1.9 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 1.4 to 2.6) and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.4), respectively (P<0.001 for both). 
      Adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for a 1-SD increase 
      in carotid incremental elastic modulus were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2) and 1.7 (95% 
      CI, 1.2 to 2.4), respectively (P<0.01 for both). The results of this study showed 
      that the presence and extent of vascular calcifications were strong predictors of 
      cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Carotid incremental elastic modulus gave 
      additional predictive value.

TI  - Effects of the dialysate calcium concentrations and mineral bone disease treatments 
      on mortality in The French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) 
      registry.
PG  - e0235135
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0235135 [doi]
LID - e0235135
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients on hemodialysis (HD), the various chemical elements in the 
      dialysate may influence survival rates. In particular, calcium modifies mineral and 
      bone metabolism and the vascular calcification rate. We studied the influence of the 
      dialysate calcium concentration and the treatments prescribed for mineral bone 
      disease (MBD) on survival. METHODS: All patients in REIN having initiated HD from 
      2010 to 2013 were classified according to their exposure to the different dialysate 
      calcium concentrations in their dialysis unit. Data on the individual patients' 
      treatments for MBD were extracted from the French national health database. Cox 
      proportional hazard models were used to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HR) 
      associated with time-dependent exposure to dialysate calcium concentrations and MBD 
      therapies, adjusted for comorbidities, laboratory and technical data. RESULTS: 
      Dialysate calcium concentration of 1.5 mmol/L was used by 81% of the dialysis 
      centers in 2010 and in 83% in 2014. Most centers were using several formulas in up 
      to 78% for 3 formulas in 2010 to 86% in 2014. In full adjusted Cox survival 
      analyses, the percentage of calcium >1.5 mmol/L and <1.5 mmol/l by center and the 
      number of formula used per center were not associated with survival. Depending on 
      the daily dose used, the MBD therapies were associated with survival improvement for 
      calcium, native vitamin D, active vitamin D, sevelamer, lanthanum and cinacalcet in 
      the second and third tertiles of dose. CONCLUSION: No influence of the dialysate 
      calcium concentration was evidenced on survival whereas all MBD therapies were 
      associated with a survival improvement depending on the daily dose used.

TI  - Determinants of progressive vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1489-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined recently that targeted treatment with calcium-based 
      phosphate binders (calcium acetate and carbonate) led to progressive coronary artery 
      and aortic calcification by electron beam tomography (EBT), while treatment with the 
      non-calcium-containing phosphate binder, sevelamer, did not. Aside from the 
      provision of calcium, we hypothesized that other factors might be related to the 
      likelihood of progressive calcification in both or either treatment groups. METHODS: 
      We explored potential determinants of progressive vascular calcification in 150 
      randomized study subjects who underwent EBT at baseline and at least once during 
      follow-up (week 26 or 52). RESULTS: Among calcium-treated subjects, higher 
      time-averaged concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and the calcium-phosphorus 
      product were associated with more pronounced increases in EBT scores; no such 
      associations were demonstrated in sevelamer-treated subjects. The relation between 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the progression of calcification was more complex. 
      Lower PTH was associated with more extensive calcification in calcium-treated 
      subjects, whereas higher PTH was associated with calcification in sevelamer-treated 
      subjects. Serum albumin was inversely correlated with progression in aortic 
      calcification. Sevelamer was associated with favourable effects on lipids, although 
      the link between these effects and the observed attenuation in vascular 
      calcification remains to be elucidated. CONCLUSION: Calcium-based phosphate binders 
      are associated with progressive coronary artery and aortic calcification, especially 
      when mineral metabolism is not well controlled. Calcium may directly or indirectly 
      (via PTH) adversely influence the balance of skeletal and extraskeletal 
      calcification in haemodialysis patients.

TI  - Renal transplantation decreases osteoprotegerin levels.
PG  - 2317-8
AB  - Vascular calcifications are an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality 
      and morbidity in patients with chronic renal failure. Osteoprotegerin, a soluble 
      decoy receptor for receptor activator NFkB ligand, has emerged as an independent 
      predictive factor of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients. Sparse data are available on the evolution of osteoprotegerin after renal 
      transplantation. The aim of this study was to follow the evolution of serum 
      osteoprotegerin levels and biochemical risk factors after renal transplantation. 
      Forty patients were included. Blood samples for analysis were collected before and 3 
      months after renal transplantation. Besides the expected diminution in 
      calcium-phosphate product, we have shown an early normalization of osteoprotegerin 
      (10.05 +/- 4.77 pmol/L to 4.59 +/- 2.26 pmol/L). This study demonstrates that kidney 
      transplantation improves this risk factor for vascular calcifications. However, 
      these preliminary results should be confirmed and extended by the follow-up of 
      vascular calcifications in the long term.

TI  - Reduced plasma pyrophosphate levels in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2495-500
AB  - Pyrophosphate (PPi) is a known inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation and has been 
      shown to inhibit medial vascular calcification in vitamin D-toxic rats. It was 
      demonstrated recently that endogenous production of PPi prevents calcification of 
      rat aorta that are cultured in high concentrations of calcium and phosphate. For 
      determining whether PPi metabolism is altered in hemodialysis patients, plasma 
      levels and dialytic clearance of PPi were measured in stable hemodialysis patients. 
      Predialysis plasma [PPi] was 2.26 +/- 0.19 microM in 38 clinically stable 
      hemodialysis patients compared with 3.26 +/- 0.17 in 36 normal subjects (P < 0.01). 
      Approximately 30% of plasma PPi was protein bound, and this was not altered in 
      dialysis patients. There was a weak inverse correlation with age in normal 
      individuals but not in dialysis patients. Plasma [PPi] in dialysis patients was 
      correlated with plasma [PO4(3-)] (r = 0.56) but not with [Ca2+], parathyroid 
      hormone, or the dose of dialysis, and levels did not vary between interdialytic 
      periods of 2 and 3 d. Plasma [PPi] decreased 32 +/- 5% after standard hemodialysis 
      in 17 patients. In vitro clearance of PPi by a 2.1-m2 cellulose acetate dialyzer was 
      36%, and the mean PPi removal in five patients was 43 +/- 5 micromol, consistent 
      with a similar in vivo clearance. Cleared PPi was greater than the plasma pool but 
      less than the estimated extracellular fluid pool. Erythrocyte PPi content decreased 
      24 +/- 4%, indicating that intracellular PPi is removed as well. It is concluded 
      that plasma [PPi] is reduced in hemodialysis patients and that PPi is cleared by 
      dialysis. Plasma levels in some patients were below those that have previously been 
      shown to prevent calcification of vessels in culture, suggesting that altered PPi 
      metabolism could contribute to vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - The circulating calcification inhibitors, fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin, but not 
      matrix Gla protein, are associated with vascular stiffness and calcification in 
      children on dialysis.
PG  - 3263-71
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification occurs in the majority of patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, but a subset of patients does not develop calcification despite 
      exposure to a similar uraemic environment. Physiological inhibitors of 
      calcification, fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and undercarboxylated-matrix Gla 
      protein (uc-MGP) may play a role in preventing the development and progression of 
      ectopic calcification, but there are scarce and conflicting data from clinical 
      studies. METHODS: We measured fetuin-A, OPG and uc-MGP in 61 children on dialysis 
      and studied their associations with clinical, biochemical and vascular measures. 
      RESULTS: Fetuin-A and OPG were higher and uc-MGP lower in dialysis patients than 
      controls. In controls, fetuin-A and OPG increased with age. Fetuin-A showed an 
      inverse correlation with dialysis vintage (P = 0.0013), time-averaged serum 
      phosphate (P = 0.03) and hs-CRP (P = 0.001). Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
      augmentation index showed a negative correlation with fetuin-A while a positive 
      correlation was seen with PWV and OPG. Patients with calcification had lower 
      fetuin-A and higher OPG than those without calcification. On multiple linear 
      regression analysis Fetuin-A independently predicted aortic PWV (P = 0.004, beta = 
      -0.45, model R(2) = 48%) and fetuin-A and OPG predicted cardiac calcification (P = 
      0.02, beta = -0.29 and P = 0.014, ss = 0.33, respectively, model R(2) = 32%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to define normal levels of the calcification 
      inhibitors in children and show that fetuin-A and OPG are associated with increased 
      vascular stiffness and calcification in children on dialysis. Higher levels of 
      fetuin-A in children suggest a possible protective upregulation of fetuin-A in the 
      early stages of exposure to the pro-calcific and pro-inflammatory uraemic 
      environment.

TI  - Peripheral vascular disease and serum phosphorus in hemodialysis: a nested 
      case-control study.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum phosphorus (P) and the product of serum calcium x serum P (Ca x 
      P), are frequently elevated in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (HD). Elevated P and Ca x P have been associated with vascular 
      calcification in dialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To examine the role of P 
      and Ca x P as risk factors for incident peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in HD 
      patients with pre-existing CVD. METHODS: This nested case-control study is drawn 
      from the 11 incident PVD events reported in the cohort of the Secondary prevention 
      with antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (SPACE): a 
      randomized placebo-controlled trial. PVD was defined clinically and confirmed 
      ultrasonographically. Each individual with a PVD event was matched for SPACE 
      treatment group (vitamin E or placebo), age (in 4-year categories) and gender with 
      two individuals who had no CVD end point during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Serum 
      P and Ca x P levels were significantly higher in PVD patients than in controls. In 
      univariate logistic regression analysis, only serum P predicted PVD in this 
      population (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.07 - 3.81, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, 
      adjustment was made for variables dissimilar by PVD status including underlying 
      renal disease, diabetes, smoking, history of angina pectoris, prescription for 
      vitamin D3, erythropoietin, calcium channel blockers and aspirin. In this model, 
      serum P remained the only significant predictor of incident PVD (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.01 
      - 5.74, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the present study are consistent with a 
      role for serum P and Ca x P in the pathogenesis of PVD in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragmented QRS (fQRS) on surface electrocardiogram is correlated with 
      increased cardiovascular risk and mortality in normal population. AIMS: To 
      investigate the presence of fQRS and its association with subclinical 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      without cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A total of 129 CKD (63 males and 66 
      females) patients was enrolled for the study. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) 
      measurement and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) were performed by the 
      same radiologist. A 12-lead electrocardiogram recording was used to detect fQRS. 
      RESULTS: The mean age was 55.1 ± 15.1 years. fQRS was detected in 45% of patients. 
      There was not any significant difference between patients with or without fQRS in 
      terms of demographic parameters and comorbid diseases except for diabetes and 
      hyperlipidaemia. The mean CIMT of CKD patients was 0.66 ± 0.18 mm and it was 
      significantly higher in fQRS(+) group compared to the fQRS(-) group. Similarly CACS 
      values were higher in fQRS(+) group. In the logistic regression analysis, fQRS 
      remained significantly associated with CIMT (β = 0.220, t = 2.567, P = 0.011) 
      (independent variables: CIMT, CACS, sodium and glomerular filtration rate 
      (modification of diet in renal disease-glomerular filtration rate)). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This is the first study in the literature showing the relation of fQRS with CIMT and 
      CACS in patients with CKD without known cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Reduced baroreflex sensitivity is associated with increased vascular calcification 
      and arterial stiffness.
PG  - 1140-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a critical determinant of cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality in chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. The pathophysiology 
      underlying this observation remains obscure. Baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) is 
      important in the maintenance of an appropriate cardiovascular status both at rest 
      and under the physiological stress of HD. BRS is determined by both the mechanical 
      properties of the vascular wall, mediating the transfer of transmural pressure, and 
      afferent and efferent autonomic function. We aimed to study the association between 
      arterial structure, function and BRS in chronic HD patients. METHODS: We studied 40 
      chronic HD patients mean age 62+/-2 (26-86) years who had received HD for a mean 
      40+/-4 (9-101) months. Spontaneous BRS was assessed using software studying the 
      relationship between inter-beat variability and beat to beat changes in systolic 
      blood pressure. Functional characteristics of conduit arteries (pulse wave analysis) 
      were studied with applanation tonometry at the radial artery. Arterial calcification 
      was assessed in lower limbs using reconstructed multi-slice computed tomography and 
      quantified with volume-corrected calcification scores within the superficial femoral 
      artery. RESULTS: Mean BRS was 4.43+/-0.44 ms/mmHg, with a wide range from 1.0 to 
      11.5 ms/mmHg. This correlated with arterial stiffness as measured by time to 
      shoulder calculated from the central pulse wave analysis (r = 0.4, P = 0.01). BRS 
      was also associated with vascular calcification (P = 0.01) but not by other factors 
      such as dialysis vintage, age or pre-dialysis systolic/diastolic blood pressure. 
      CONCLUSION: The reduction in BRS and the resulting aberrant blood pressure response 
      to the physiological stress and volume changes of HD may be important in the further 
      understanding of the pathophysiology of the increased mortality in HD patients with 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Alkalosis and Dialytic Clearance of Phosphate Increases Phosphatase Activity: A 
      Hidden Consequence of Hemodialysis.
PG  - e0159858
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159858 [doi]
LID - e0159858
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular pyrophosphate is a potent endogenous inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification, which is degraded by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and generated by 
      hydrolysis of ATP via ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). 
      ALP activity (as routinely measured in clinical practice) represents the maximal 
      activity (in ideal conditions), but not the real activity (in normal or 
      physiological conditions). For the first time, the present study investigated 
      extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism during hemodialysis sessions (including its 
      synthesis via eNPP1 and its degradation via ALP) in physiological conditions. 
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: 45 patients in hemodialysis were studied. Physiological ALP 
      activity represents only 4-6% of clinical activity. ALP activity increased 
      post-hemodialysis by 2% under ideal conditions (87.4 ± 3.3 IU/L vs. 89.3 ± 3.6 IU/L) 
      and 48% under physiological conditions (3.5 ± 0.2 IU/L vs. 5.2 ± 0.2 IU/L). 
      Pyrophosphate synthesis by ATP hydrolysis remained unaltered post-hemodialysis. 
      Post-hemodialysis plasma pH (7.45 ± 0.02) significantly increased compared with the 
      pre-dialysis pH (7.26 ± 0.02). The slight variation in pH (~0.2 units) induced a 
      significant increase in ALP activity (9%). Addition of phosphate in 
      post-hemodialysis plasma significantly decreased ALP activity, although this effect 
      was not observed with the addition of urea. Reduction in phosphate levels and 
      increment in pH were significantly associated with an increase in physiological ALP 
      activity post-hemodialysis. A decrease in plasma pyrophosphate levels (3.3 ± 0.3 
      μmol/L vs. 1.9 ± 0.1 μmol/L) and pyrophosphate/ATP ratio (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) 
      post-hemodialysis was also observed. CONCLUSION: Extraction of uremic toxins, 
      primarily phosphate and hydrogen ions, dramatically increases the ALP activity under 
      physiological conditions. This hitherto unknown consequence of hemodialysis suggests 
      a reinterpretation of the clinical value of this parameter.

TI  - Accelerated vascular calcification and relative hypoparathyroidism in incident 
      haemodialysis diabetic patients receiving calcium binders.
PG  - 3215-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and low bone turnover with a relatively low 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) often coexist in diabetic patients undergoing 
      haemodialysis. Since calcium salts (CaS) are used extensively as primary phosphate 
      binders and have been associated with progressive vascular calcification, we studied 
      the effects of CaS on coronary arteries and parathyroid activity in incident 
      haemodialysis diabetic patients. METHODS: We measured the change in coronary artery 
      calcium scores (CACS) with sequential electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 64 
      diabetic and 45 non-diabetic patients, randomized to CaS or sevelamer within 90 days 
      of starting haemodialysis. CACS measurements were repeated after 6, 12 and 18 
      months. Serum intact PTH (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus were serially tested. 
      RESULTS: During the study period, serum phosphate was similar in diabetic and 
      non-diabetic patients. Serum calcium levels were similar at baseline (2.3+/-0.25 
      mmol/l for both) and increased significantly with CaS treatment (P<0.05) both in 
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients but not with sevelamer. Diabetic patients treated 
      with CaS showed a significantly greater CACS progression than sevelamer-treated 
      patients (median increase 177 vs 27; P=0.05). During follow-up, diabetic patients 
      receiving CaS were significantly more likely to develop serum iPTH values<16 pmol/l 
      than diabetic patients treated with sevelamer (33% vs 6%, P=0.005) and had a lower 
      mean iPTH level (24+/-16 vs 31+/-14 pmol/l; P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The management of 
      hyperphosphataemia with CaS in haemodialysis diabetic patients is associated with a 
      significantly greater progression of CACS than with sevelamer. These effects are 
      accompanied by iPTH changes suggestive of low bone turnover.

TI  - Bone alkaline phosphatase and mortality in dialysis patients.
PG  - 1752-9
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10091110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) is associated with 
      vascular calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients, but AP derives from 
      various tissues of origin. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 
      bone-specific AP (BAP) on morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: From a prospective cohort study of incident 
      dialysis patients in The Netherlands, all patients with measured BAP at 12 months 
      after the start of dialysis (baseline) were included in the analysis (n = 800; mean 
      age, 59 ± 15 years; mean BAP = 18 ± 13 U/L). By Cox regression analyses, we assessed 
      the impact of BAP levels on short-term mortality (6 months) and longer-term 
      mortality (4-year follow-up). RESULTS: High levels of BAP strongly affected 
      short-term mortality. After adjustment for confounders, patients in the highest BAP 
      tertile had a 5.7-fold increased risk of death within 6 months compared with 
      patients in the lowest tertile. The effect applied to both cardiovascular and 
      noncardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, high levels of BAP were associated with 
      increased cardiovascular mortality in the longer term. In comparison with total AP, 
      the effect sizes related to clinical outcomes were much higher for BAP. CONCLUSIONS: 
      High levels of BAP were strongly associated with short-term mortality in dialysis 
      patients, pointing out the important impact of bone turnover. Longitudinal 
      assessments of BAP may be useful for the treatment monitoring in clinical practice 
      in dialysis patients.

TI  - Effect of hemodialysis on the distribution of phosphates in blood.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - Phosphate retention is commonly associated with chronic renal failure. Previously we 
      presented a technique to calculate the distribution of phosphate constituents in 
      body fluids. We studied it in pre- and postdialysis serum of 62 patients. After 
      hemodialysis, there was some decrease in the concentration of each constituent, with 
      significant changes in the molar fraction of H2PO4- and CaHPO4. There is a 
      significant negative correlation between the molecular mass of the constituent (X) 
      and the effect of dialysis (Y): urea and H2PO4- 50%; NaHPO4-, HPO4(2-), and 
      creatinine 41-44%; MgHPO4 39%, and CaHPO4 28%. Y = 69.7 - 0.26x, r = -0.833, p less 
      than 0.001. This limited removal of CaHPO4 may contribute to the vascular 
      calcification and peripheral ischemic necrosis of chronic uremic patients.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification: an immutable pathologic finding in chronic kidney 
      disease?
PG  - 606-9
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000291 [doi]
AB  - Although less frequent than vascular calcification, cardiac valve calcification 
      (CVC) is a relevant clinical problem affecting about 2%-10% of adults from the 
      general population aged 75 years and older, and is 5- to 10-fold more prevalent in 
      individuals with impaired kidney function. An expanding body of evidence suggests 
      that mineral metabolism abnormalities aside from traditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors are involved in CVC pathogenesis. Nonetheless, very few studies have 
      investigated whether mineral metabolism manipulation impacts CVC. In this issue of 
      the Journal of Nephrology, it is reported that a combination of low-phosphate diet 
      and sevelamer may reduce CVC. Though the observational nature of that study and the 
      lack of a control group significantly limit the generalizability of these results, 
      they fit in with the ongoing debate on the role of chronic kidney disease mineral 
      bone metabolism (CKD-MBD) in the pathogenesis of vascular disease and suggest the 
      importance of mineral metabolism control in patients with CKD.

TI  - Effects of cyclic intermittent etidronate therapy on coronary artery calcification 
      in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 680-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is thought to be associated with 
      greater cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease than in 
      nonuremic persons. The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of 
      etidronate, a synthetic analogue of pyrophosphate, on progression of CAC score. 
      METHODS: The extent of CAC was evaluated by using multidetector spiral computed 
      tomography. Repeated CAC score estimation was possible in 35 patients (29 men, 6 
      women). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry. Serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) was measured by using enzyme-linked 
      immunoassay. Serum etidronate was measured by means of the gas spectrometry 
      technique using deuterium-labeled etidronate as internal standard. RESULTS: Mean 
      patient age was 63.2 +/- 8.2 (SD) years, and mean duration of dialysis therapy was 
      7.4 +/- 5.5 years. CAC score was estimated 3 times in each patient. After the second 
      CAC score estimation, 35 patients were administered etidronate, 200 mg/d, for 14 
      days. This cycle was repeated 3 times every 90 days. CAC progression was 
      significantly less pronounced during treatment with etidronate compared with the 
      period before treatment was initiated. The median annualized absolute increase in 
      calcified volume was 195.0 mm3 without treatment compared with -490.0 mm3 during 
      treatment ( P < 0.01). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on changes in CAC 
      score during etidronate treatment. Responders (n = 26) were patients whose CAC score 
      decreased during therapy, and nonresponders (n = 9) were patients whose CAC score 
      increased, even after etidronate therapy. Serum C-reactive protein values (0.18 +/- 
      0.13 mg/dL) in the responder group were greater than those (0.14 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) in 
      the nonresponder group ( P = 0.013). Serum OPG levels decreased significantly during 
      etidronate therapy (256.8 +/- 93.8 versus 245.0 +/- 83.0 pg/mL; P = 0.0161). 
      Etidronate was well tolerated during the study. BMD values during etidronate therapy 
      were not significantly changed from 0.941 +/- 0.125 to 0.968 +/- 0.246 g/cm2. 
      CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggest that the extent of CAC may be 
      suppressed by etidronate in association with a reduction in chronic inflammatory 
      responses. They also suggest that a decrease in serum OPG concentrations by means of 
      etidronate may be associated with changes in vascular calcification in dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (ucMGP) is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 359-66
AB  - Matrix gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) protein (MGP) is a potent local inhibitor of 
      cardiovascular calcification and accumulates at areas of calcification in its 
      uncarboxylated form (ucMGP). We previously found significantly lower circulating 
      ucMGP levels in patients with a high vascular calcification burden. Here we report 
      on the potential of circulating ucMGP to serve as a biomarker for vascular 
      calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Circulating ucMGP levels were measured 
      with an ELISA-based assay in 40 HD patients who underwent multi-slice computed 
      tomography (MSCT) scanning to quantify the extent of coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC). The mean ucMGP level in HD patients (193 +/- 65 nM) was significantly lower 
      as compared to apparently healthy subjects of the same age (441 +/- 97 nM; p < 
      0.001) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) without CAC (560 +/- 140 nM; p < 
      0.001). Additionally, ucMGP levels correlated inversely with CAC scores (r = -0.41; 
      p = 0.009), and this correlation persisted after adjustment for age, dialysis 
      vintage and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Since circulating ucMGP 
      levels are significantly and inversely correlated with the extent of CAC in HD 
      patients, ucMGP may become a tool for identifying HD patients with a high 
      probability of cardiovascular calcification.

TI  - Vascular calcification score on plain radiographs of the feet as a predictor of 
      peripheral arterial disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 773-80
LID - 10.1007/s11255-009-9697-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of lower extremity amputation is increasing in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) 
      in patients with CKD are uncommon. The aim of the current study was to assess the 
      value of the vascular calcification (VC) score on plain radiographs of the feet for 
      the prediction of PAD in patients with CKD. METHODS: We recruited 102 patients with 
      CKD (24 pre-dialysis, 58 hemodialysis [HD], and 20 peritoneal dialysis [PD]). We 
      defined the VC score on the plain radiographs of the feet as follows: score 0, no 
      calcification; score 1, the length of the VC is <5 cm in a single foot or <2 cm in 
      both feet; and score 2, the length of the VC is >5 cm in a single foot or >2 cm in 
      both feet. We evaluated the atherosclerotic calcified plaques of the femoral or 
      popliteal artery with Doppler ultrasonography and compared it with the VC score. 
      RESULTS: Patients with high VC scores showed more atherosclerotic calcified plaques 
      in the femoral or popliteal artery (P < 0.01). The prevalence of PAD in patients 
      with CKD was closely related with the VC score (P < 0.01). PAD was associated with 
      diabetes, a higher hsCRP, and a lower total cholesterol level (P < 0.01). The VC 
      score was a significant predictor of the presence of PAD (odds ratio: 6.66, P < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic CKD patients, including those on HD and PD, may 
      have PAD and routine testing by plain radiographs of the feet followed by Doppler 
      ultrasonography are of pivotal significance, especially if the patients are 
      diabetic.

TI  - Apabetalone Mediated Epigenetic Modulation is Associated with Favorable Kidney 
      Function and Alkaline Phosphatase Profile in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.1159/000488257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The association between serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with 
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes, in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients has 
      previously been reported and may be a result of increased vascular calcification and 
      inflammation. Here we report, for the first time, the effects of pharmacologic 
      epigenetic modulation on levels of ALP and kidney function via a novel oral small 
      molecule BET inhibitor, apabetalone, in CKD patients. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis 
      evaluated patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 
      mL/min/1.73m2, who participated in the apabetalone phase 2 randomized controlled 
      trials (SUSTAIN and ASSURE). 48 CKD subjects with a history of cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) were treated with 100mg twice-daily of 24 and 26 weeks of apabetalone 
      or placebo. ALP and eGFR were measured prior to randomization and at final visits. 
      RESULTS: Patients who received apabetalone (n=35) versus placebo (n=13) over 6 
      months showed significantly (p=0.02) lowered serum ALP -14.0% (p<0.0001 versus 
      baseline) versus -6.3% (p=0.9 versus baseline). The eGFR in the apabetalone group 
      increased by 3.4% (1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) (p=0.04 versus baseline) and decreased by 
      5.8% (2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2) (p=0.6 versus baseline) in the placebo group. Apabetalone 
      was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: A post-hoc analysis of CKD subjects from the SUSTAIN 
      and ASSURE randomized controlled trials demonstrated favorable effects of 
      apabetalone on ALP and eGFR, and generated the hypothesis that epigenetic modulation 
      by BET inhibition may potentially offer a novel therapeutic strategy to treat CVD 
      and progressive kidney function loss in CKD patients. This is being examined in the 
      phase III trial BETonMACE.

TI  - Changes in cardiovascular calcification after parathyroidectomy in patients with 
      ESRD.
PG  - 464-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of parathyroidectomy on vascular calcification in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease has been a subject of interest for many years, although 
      studies in this area have not been definitive. The purpose of this investigation is 
      to determine changes in vascular calcification after subtotal parathyroidectomy by 
      using fast-gated helical computed axial tomographic imaging to measure coronary and 
      carotid artery calcification. METHODS: Computed tomographic imaging was performed at 
      baseline and in follow-up on 10 patients who had undergone subtotal 
      parathyroidectomy and 10 reference patients who had not undergone parathyroidectomy. 
      RESULTS: Patients who underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy had a mean change in 
      coronary calcification of -92.3 +/- 469/y, and reference patients had a mean change 
      of +479 +/- 630/y (P = 0.03). The 2 parathyroidectomy patients with the highest 
      baseline scores had significant declines in both coronary and carotid calcification. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, subtotal parathyroidectomy is associated with a 
      significant decrease in vascular calcification in 2 of 10 dialysis patients with 
      high coronary artery calcium scores and stabilization in 7 of 10 patients with low 
      baseline scores.

TI  - Non-Traditional Aspects of Renal Diets: Focus on Fiber, Alkali and Vitamin K1 
      Intake.
LID - 10.3390/nu9050444 [doi]
LID - 444
AB  - Renal diets for advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are structured to achieve a 
      lower protein, phosphate and sodium intake, while supplying adequate energy. The aim 
      of this nutritional intervention is to prevent or correct signs, symptoms and 
      complications of renal insufficiency, delaying the start of dialysis and preserving 
      nutritional status. This paper focuses on three additional aspects of renal diets 
      that can play an important role in the management of CKD patients: the vitamin K1 
      and fiber content, and the alkalizing potential. We examined the energy and 
      nutrients composition of four types of renal diets according to their protein 
      content: normal diet (ND, 0.8 g protein/kg body weight (bw)), low protein diet (LPD, 
      0.6 g protein/kg bw), vegan diet (VD, 0.7 g protein/kg bw), very low protein diet 
      (VLPD, 0.3 g protein/kg bw). Fiber content is much higher in the VD and in the VLPD 
      than in the ND or LPD. Vitamin K1 content seems to follow the same trend, but 
      vitamin K2 content, which could not be investigated, might have a different pattern. 
      The net endogenous acid production (NEAP) value decreases from the ND and LPD to the 
      vegetarian diets, namely VD and VLPD; the same finding occurred for the potential 
      renal acid load (PRAL). In conclusion, renal diets may provide additional benefits, 
      and this is the case of vegetarian diets. Namely, VD and VLPD also provide high 
      amounts of fibers and Vitamin K1, with a very low acid load. These features may have 
      favorable effects on Vitamin K1 status, intestinal microbiota and acid-base balance. 
      Hence, we can speculate as to the potential beneficial effects on vascular 
      calcification and bone disease, on protein metabolism, on colonic environment and 
      circulating levels of microbial-derived uremic toxins. In the case of vegetarian 
      diets, attention must be paid to serum potassium levels.

TI  - Baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in the Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl 
      Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial.
PG  - 2872-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) and other abnormalities associated 
      with chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder can contribute to dystrophic 
      (including vascular) calcification. Dietary modification and variety of medications 
      can be used to attenuate the severity of sHPT. However, it is unknown whether any of 
      these approaches can reduce the high risks of death and cardiovascular disease in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: The Evaluation of Cinacalcet HCl 
      Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial was designed to test the 
      hypothesis that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet compared with 
      placebo (on a background of conventional therapy including phosphate binders +/- 
      vitamin D sterols) reduces time to death or non-fatal cardiovascular events 
      (specifically myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure and peripheral 
      arterial disease events) among patients on hemodialysis with sHPT. This report 
      describes baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects with a focus on regional 
      variation. RESULTS: There were 3883 subjects randomized from 22 countries, including 
      the USA, Canada, Australia, three Latin American nations, Russia and 15 European 
      nations. The burden of overt cardiovascular disease at baseline was high (e.g. 
      myocardial infarction 12.4%, heart failure 23.3%). The median plasma parathyroid 
      hormone concentration at baseline was 692 pg/mL (10%, 90% range, 363-1694 pg/mL). At 
      baseline, 87.2% of subjects were prescribed phosphate binders and 57.5% were 
      prescribed activated vitamin D derivatives. Demographic data, comorbid conditions 
      and baseline laboratory data varied significantly across regions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      EVOLVE enrolled 3883 subjects on hemodialysis with moderate to severe sHPT. 
      Inclusion of subjects from multiple global regions with varying degrees of disease 
      severity will enhance the external validity of the trial results.

TI  - Association of bone turnover markers and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD).
PG  - 1127-32
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2011.01.016 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased 
      vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation of the 
      calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains unclear. We 
      investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors 
      (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone; 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged 
      (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover markers (bone-specific 
      alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and 
      MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), 
      femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was 
      assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a 
      significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, 
      p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were 
      seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) 
      and SI(DVP) independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant 
      relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A 
      significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SI(DVP) in CKD 
      stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following 
      correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data 
      suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in 
      pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical 
      usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD.

TI  - Factors associated with aortic stiffness and its change over time in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 4041-8
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq293 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in aortic stiffness, as reflected by an increase in pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV), is an important predictor of cardiovascular mortality in 
      dialysis patients. Decreased serum concentration of calcification inhibitor, such as 
      fetuin-A, is inversely related to mortality in haemodialysis patients. Our aim is to 
      investigate the factors associated with aortic stiffness and its change over time in 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: As a prospective observational study, we 
      analysed 67 PD patients, aged 50 ± 14 years (mean ± SD) and with dialysis duration 
      of 26 (5-58) months (median, interquartile range). At baseline, age, mean arterial 
      pressure (MAP), left ventricular mass (LVM) index, diabetes, serum albumin, calcium 
      (Ca), phosphorus (P) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), uric acid, total 
      bilirubin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fetuin-A, and residual renal 
      function were included in association analysis with aortic stiffness represented by 
      heart-to-femoral PWV (hfPWV). We also evaluated simple vascular calcification score 
      (SVCS) with plain radiograph of the pelvis and both hands. PWV was measured both at 
      baseline and at 1 year. Change of aortic stiffness was determined by △PWV 
      (difference between 1-year PWV and baseline PWV). Time-averaged concentrations were 
      used to evaluate the relation between biologic markers and changes of aortic 
      stiffness. RESULTS: hfPWV was 1022 ± 276 cm/s at baseline, and hfPWV determined at 1 
      year was 1069 ± 317 cm/s. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.34 ± 0.08 g/L. At 
      baseline, aortic PWV positively correlated with age, smoking status, diabetes, MAP, 
      total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. On the other hand, aortic PWV inversely 
      correlated with fetuin-A, log PTH, haemoglobin and albumin. In a multiple regression 
      model, association of serum fetuin-A (β = -0.329, P = 0.003) with aortic PWV 
      remained significant, along with age (β = 0.512, P < 0.001), MAP (β = 0.215, P = 
      0.047) and log PTH (β = -0.269, P = 0.025). At follow-up, △MAP (β = 0.500, P < 
      0.001) and time-averaged TG (aTG) (β = 0.259 P = 0.019) were determinants of △PWV. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For our PD patients, serum fetuin-A was an independent determinant of 
      aortic stiffness, as well as age, MAP and log PTH. Although 1 year is not sufficient 
      to observe the change of aortic stiffness, some patients exhibited >15% increase of 
      PWV during this period. △MAP and aTG were factors affecting the change of PWV. 
      Follow-up over a longer period is necessary to elucidate factors that determine 
      changes of aortic stiffness over time from PD patients.

TI  - Large artery calcification on dialysis patients is located in the intima and related 
      to atherosclerosis.
PG  - 303-10
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04290510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) has a significant effect in 
      cardiovascular diseases on dialysis patients. However, VC is assessed with 
      x-ray-based techniques, which do not inform about calcium localization (intima, 
      media, atherosclerosis-related). The aim of this work is to study VC and its related 
      factors using arterial ultrasound to report the exact location of calcium. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, 
      case-control study that included 232 patients in dialysis and 208 age- and 
      sex-matched controls with normal kidney function. Demographic data and laboratory 
      values were collated. Carotid, femoral, and brachial ultrasounds were performed to 
      assess VC and atherosclerosis burden using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: 
      Cardiovascular risk factors were predominantly found in controls, although the 
      burden of atherosclerosis was higher in the dialysis group. VC was significantly 
      more prevalent in the group of patients on dialysis than control subjects, and in 
      both groups the most prevalent pattern of VC was linear calcification located in the 
      intima of the artery wall. Age and undergoing dialysis (with or without previous 
      cardiovascular diseases) were positively and significantly associated with linear 
      calcification. Conversely, the absence of atherosclerosis and low levels of 
      C-reactive protein and phosphorus significantly impeded the development of linear 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: VC in large, conduit arteries is more prevalent in 
      patients on dialysis than controls and is predominantly located in a linear fashion 
      in the intima of the arteries.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with mortality in calcific 
      uremic arteriolopathy.
PG  - 2247-2256
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1721-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is an often-fatal condition in 
      dialysis patients. The clinical descriptions and treatments of CUA patients have 
      been confined mostly to case reports. We report a comprehensive characterization of 
      CUA and its associated diagnosis, treatment patterns, and outcome. METHODS: An 
      internet-based registry collected information about CUA in dialysis patients. 
      Univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios of 
      the association between clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and treatments 
      with all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 117 CUA patients had adequate 
      information for analysis. The majority of patients (56.7%) were diagnosed 
      clinically, with only 32.5% biopsied. Debridement was undertaken in 42.6% of cases. 
      Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) was initiated in 54.7% of patients; most 
      received ≥ 12.5 g of STS (98.3%) for < 3 months (79.7%). Mean parathyroid hormone 
      (PTH) and phosphorus (P) were 459 ± 492 pg/mL and 6.3 ± 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. A 
      total of 24 patients (21.6%, of 111 with information) died, with a median survival 
      time of 2.9 months. In univariate analysis, higher mortality was observed in 
      patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD; HR = 10.47; 95% CI 1.40-78.38), those 
      taking warfarin at time of diagnosis (HR = 2.74; 95% CI 1.16-6.51), and those who 
      had both diabetes (DM) and CVD and who were taking warfarin (HR = 13.41; 95% CI 
      1.66-109.29). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world clinical practice, there is substantial 
      variability in the diagnosis and treatment of CUA. There is usually only modest 
      derangement of bone and mineral parameters at the time of diagnosis. Death is 
      common. The presence of CVD and use of warfarin may influence clinical outcome after 
      diagnosis of CUA.

TI  - The ADVANCE study: a randomized study to evaluate the effects of cinacalcet plus 
      low-dose vitamin D on vascular calcification in patients on hemodialysis.
PG  - 1327-39
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial compared the progression 
      of vascular and cardiac valve calcification in 360 prevalent adult hemodialysis 
      patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism treated with either cinacalcet plus 
      low-dose vitamin D sterols or flexible doses of vitamin D sterols alone. METHODS: 
      Eligible subjects were on hemodialysis for ≥ 3 months with parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
      > 300 pg/mL or PTH 150-300 pg/mL with calcium-phosphorus product > 50 mg(2)/dL(2) 
      while receiving vitamin D. All subjects received calcium-based phosphate binders. 
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and aorta and cardiac valve calcium scores were 
      determined both by Agatston and volume scoring using multi-detector computed 
      tomography. Subjects with Agatston CAC scores ≥ 30 were randomized to cinacalcet 
      (30- 180 mg/day) plus low-dose calcitriol or vitamin D analog (≤ 2 μg paricalcitol 
      equivalent/dialysis), or flexible vitamin D therapy. The primary end point was 
      percentage change in Agatston CAC score from baseline to Week 52. RESULTS: Median 
      (P10, P90) Agatston CAC scores increased 24% (-22%, 119%) in the cinacalcet group 
      and 31% (-9%, 179%) in the flexible vitamin D group (P = 0.073). Corresponding 
      changes in volume CAC scores were 22% (-12%, 105%) and 30% (-6%, 133%; P = 0.009). 
      Increases in calcification scores were consistently less in the aorta, aortic valve 
      and mitral valve among subjects treated with cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D 
      sterols, and the differences between groups were significant at the aortic valve. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D sterols may attenuate 
      vascular and cardiac valve calcification.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification at the initiation of hemodialysis is a risk factor for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease: a cohort study.
PG  - 56

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification has been recognized as a risk factor for 
      cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, 
      the association of carotid artery calcification (CAAC) with CV events remains 
      unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether CAAC is associated with 
      composite CV events in ESRD patients. METHODS: One-hundred thirty-three patients who 
      had been started on hemodialysis between 2004 and 2008 were included in this 
      retrospective cohort study. These patients received multi-detector computed 
      tomography to assess CAAC at the initiation of hemodialysis. Composite CV events, 
      including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular diseases, and CV 
      deaths after the initiation of hemodialysis, were examined in each patient. RESULTS: 
      CAAC was found in 94 patients (71%). At the end of follow-up, composite CV events 
      were seen in 47 patients: ischemic heart disease in 20, heart failure in 8, 
      cerebrovascular disease in 12, and CV deaths in 7. The incidence of CAAC was 87% in 
      patients with CV events, which was significantly higher than the rate (62%) in those 
      without. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant increase in composite CV events 
      in patients with CAAC compared with those without CAAC (p = 0.001, log-rank test). 
      Univariate analysis using a Cox hazards model showed that age, smoking, common 
      carotid artery intima-media thickness and CAAC were risk factors for composite CV 
      events. In multivariate analysis, only CAAC was a significant risk factor for 
      composite CV events (hazard ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.00; p = 
      0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CAAC is an independent risk factor for CV events in ESRD 
      patients. The assessment of CAAC at the initiation of hemodialysis is useful for 
      predicting the prognosis.

TI  - Fetuin-A is an independent determinant of change of aortic stiffness over 1 year in 
      non-diabetic patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 1853-8
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) patients. This calcification leads to arterial stiffening. Fetuin-A is an 
      endogenous inhibitor of vascular calcification and has been associated with arterial 
      stiffness and mortality in dialysis patients. We tested the relationship between 
      fetuin-A and change in arterial stiffness in CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: We 
      measured fetuin-A concentrations in 92 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 and studied 
      the association with clinical, biochemical and vascular parameters including 
      arterial stiffness measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) at 0 and 12 
      months. RESULTS: Fetuin-A was significantly lower in the non-diabetic group (n = 73) 
      compared to the diabetic group (n = 19, P = 0.018). There was a significant 
      interaction between diabetic status and fetuin-A concentration. Univariate analysis 
      of the non-diabetic group showed association between change in aortic stiffness over 
      1 year with fetuin-A (r = -0.481, P < 0.0001) and systolic blood pressure (r = 
      0.389, P = 0.001) and baseline PWV (r = 0.240, P = 0.041). In multivariate analysis, 
      fetuin-A, systolic blood pressure and baseline PWV independently predicted change in 
      carotid-femoral PWV at 1 year (beta = -0.355, P = or< 0.001; beta = 0.426, P < 
      0.001; and beta = -0.383, P < 0.001, respectively; model R(2) = 0.455). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with non-diabetic CKD stages 3 and 4, fetuin-A is an independent risk 
      factor for progressive arterial stiffness.

TI  - Association of low serum fetuin A levels with poor arteriovenous access patency in 
      patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 720-7
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2010.06.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients, is associated 
      with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      Whether it predicts arteriovenous (AV) access patency is unknown. This study aimed 
      to investigate the association between fetuin A and AV access patency in HD 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 238 
      prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean age, 60 ± 12 years) were followed 
      up for AV access patency for 32 months. PREDICTORS: Tertiles of baseline circulating 
      fetuin A levels, corresponding to 0.15-0.25, 0.26-0.32, and 0.33-0.51 g/L. OUTCOME: 
      The major outcome was loss of unassisted AV access patency, defined as AV access 
      thrombosis or need for intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Fetuin A and other markers of 
      inflammation. RESULTS: 100 patients had loss of AV access patency (42%) on 
      follow-up. Patients in the lowest fetuin A tertile had the worst AV access patency 
      (log-rank test, χ(2) = 8.68; P = 0.01). Using Cox proportional hazards regression 
      with patients in the lowest fetuin A tertile as reference, patients in the 
      intermediate tertile had an HR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29-0.82), whereas those in the 
      highest fetuin A tertile had an HR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25-0.75) for loss of AV access 
      patency. Similarly, considering patients using AV fistulas or grafts separately, 
      patients in the highest fetuin A tertile had less risk of losing AV access patency 
      than patients in the other tertiles (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.19-0.84] for patients with 
      AV fistulas and HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.10-0.65] for patients with AV grafts). 
      LIMITATIONS: Focus on the patency of prevalent rather than new AV access in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated 
      with a higher risk of loss of AV access patency in either native AV fistulas or AV 
      grafts in HD patients.

TI  - Effect of cinacalcet on cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 2482-94
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1205624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disorders of mineral metabolism, including secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, are thought to contribute to extraskeletal (including vascular) 
      calcification among patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been hypothesized 
      that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet might reduce the risk of death 
      or nonfatal cardiovascular events in such patients. METHODS: In this clinical trial, 
      we randomly assigned 3883 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism (median level of intact parathyroid hormone, 693 pg per 
      milliliter [10th to 90th percentile, 363 to 1694]) who were undergoing hemodialysis 
      to receive either cinacalcet or placebo. All patients were eligible to receive 
      conventional therapy, including phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols, or both. The 
      patients were followed for up to 64 months. The primary composite end point was the 
      time until death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart 
      failure, or a peripheral vascular event. The primary analysis was performed on the 
      basis of the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The median duration of 
      study-drug exposure was 21.2 months in the cinacalcet group, versus 17.5 months in 
      the placebo group. The primary composite end point was reached in 938 of 1948 
      patients (48.2%) in the cinacalcet group and 952 of 1935 patients (49.2%) in the 
      placebo group (relative hazard in the cinacalcet group vs. the placebo group, 0.93; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.11). Hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal 
      adverse events were significantly more frequent in patients receiving cinacalcet. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not 
      significantly reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular events in patients 
      with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who were undergoing dialysis.

TI  - Medial artery calcification of uremic patients: a histological, histochemical and 
      ultrastructural study.
PG  - 191-200
LID - 10.14670/HH-26.191 [doi]
AB  - Recent findings suggest that vascular calcification (VC) is an active process 
      similar to bone mineralization, the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergoing 
      phenotypic differentiation into osteoblastic cells and synthesizing 
      calcification-regulating proteins found in bone. This study has investigated the VC 
      process of uremic patients, with a morphologic approach. Epigastric artery samples 
      from 49 uremic, non-diabetic patients were taken during kidney transplantation. 
      Sections from paraffin-embedded samples were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and von 
      Kossa. CD68 was immunohistochemically detected, and sections from frozen samples 
      were stained with Oil Red O. Deeply calcified samples were stained with Picrosirius 
      Red, PAS, and Alcian blue. Specimens from one patient with moderate and one with 
      severe VC were examined under the electron microscope. None of the samples had 
      atherosclerosis. Calcifications were found in the media of 38 patients. In 23, 
      dot-like calcifications were irregularly scattered near the adventitia (light VC); 
      in 11, granular calcifications formed concentric rings near the adventitia 
      (moderate-advanced VC); in 4, zones of consolidated calcifications were found 
      (severe VC). These zones were poor in collagen, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. In 
      cases with moderate or severe VC, VSCMs showed necrotic changes. Matrix vesicles 
      could be recognized in the extracellular spaces. In cases with severe VC, 
      uncalcified or partially calcified membranous bodies were found, together with 
      Liesegang rings. Patches of fibrin were also found. These findings point to a mainly 
      degenerative mechanism of VC, which proceeds from the outer portion of the media. An 
      active mechanism, however, cannot be excluded. A unifying hypothesis is suggested.

TI  - The effectiveness of cinacalcet: a randomized, open label study in chronic 
      hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 326-333
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1562356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high incidences 
      of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study was conducted to 
      demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic kidney 
      disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis patients 
      with severe SHPT. METHODS: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were randomized to 
      cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the achievement of >30% 
      reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated to further explore the 
      effect of cinacalcet on CKD-MBD parameters for 24-week follow up and 12 additional 
      weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation. RESULTS: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH 
      levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 
      (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving 
      iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, 
      p = .001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF-23, 
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid 
      gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24-week follow up and 
      markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD 
      patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF-23, 
      and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can 
      provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially 
      effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an 
      alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL

TI  - High levels of circulating sclerostin are associated with better cardiovascular 
      survival in incident dialysis patients: results from the NECOSAD study.
PG  - 288-93
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfu301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity 
      and bone turnover, and it plays a role in cardiovascular calcification processes. 
      Previous findings indicate that sclerostin regulation is disturbed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to assess the association of circulating 
      sclerostin levels with mortality in dialysis patients. METHODS: From a prospective 
      cohort study of incident dialysis patients in the Netherlands, all patients with 
      measured circulating sclerostin at 3 months after the start of dialysis (baseline) 
      were included in the present analysis: n = 673, age 63 ± 14 years, mean serum 
      sclerostin (ELISA) 1.24 ± 0.57 ng/mL. By Cox regression analyses, we assessed the 
      association of sclerostin levels with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular 
      mortality both in the short (18 months) and long term (4-year follow-up). RESULTS: 
      Serum sclerostin levels in the entire cohort correlated with intact parathyroid 
      hormone levels (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), age (r = 0.16, P < 0.001) and serum alkaline 
      phosphatase (r = -0.13, P = 0.001). After adjustment for various clinical and 
      biochemical parameters, patients in the highest sclerostin tertile had a 
      significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death [hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.13-0.62] and for all-cause mortality (0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.68) within 
      18 months compared with patients of the lowest tertile. The association of 
      sclerostin levels with outcome was less pronounced for long-term cardiovascular 
      mortality and absent for non-cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of 
      serum sclerostin are associated with lower short-term cardiovascular mortality in 
      dialysis patients. The exact mechanisms of this association, e.g. how sclerostin 
      influences or reflects uraemic vascular calcification, need to be investigated in 
      further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited health literacy is prevalent and has been linked to adverse 
      patient outcomes. We examined the relationship between health literacy and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including blood pressure (BP) parameters, 
      lipids, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), and tobacco utilization 
      among dialysis patients. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 72 
      participants in a prospective cohort study of vascular calcification in newly 
      initiated dialysis patients. Health literacy was assessed using the Short Test of 
      Functional Health Literacy (S-TOFHLA) in Adults. The study population was 
      dichotomized into those with and without adequate literacy. Linear and logistic 
      regression analyses were used to predict continuous and dichotomous cardiovascular 
      risk factor variables, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent had limited health 
      literacy. Compared to limited health literacy, adequate health literacy was 
      associated with lower BP parameters in multivariable analyses (systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP): β -16.8, s.e. 6.7, P = 0.01; diastolic blood pressure (DBP): β 
      -13.8, s.e. 4.1, P = 0.001; mean arterial pressure (MAP): β -14.8, s.e. 4.6, P = 
      0.002). Health literacy was not a statistically significant predictor of low-density 
      lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, WHR, BMI, or 
      tobacco utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Limited health literacy is common in individuals 
      on dialysis. Individuals with adequate health literacy skills had DBP readings that 
      were on average 13.8 mm Hg lower and MAP that was 14.8 mm Hg lower than those with 
      inadequate health literacy. Prospective studies to elucidate if improvements in 
      health literacy skills will lead to improvement in BP control are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is observed in patients with early chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the safety and efficacy of cinacalcet 
      for secondary hyperparathyroidism in participants with CKD not receiving dialysis. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, 32-week, phase 3 study. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 404 participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD from 73 centers in 9 countries. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Cinacalcet:placebo (3:1 ratio). OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Proportion 
      of participants with a mean decrease of 30% or greater in intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH) level, proportion with iPTH level of 70 or less or 110 or less pg/mL (stage 3 
      and 4 CKD, respectively), and mean percentage of iPTH change from baseline, all 
      during the efficacy-assessment phase. RESULTS: A greater proportion of cinacalcet 
      than placebo participants achieved a 30% or greater decrease in iPTH level (74% 
      versus 28%; P < 0.001), corresponding to a 43.1% decrease in iPTH level from 
      baseline (cinacalcet) compared with a 1.1% increase (placebo). At week 32, serum 
      calcium levels were 8.9 +/- 0.8 mg/dL (-8.9%; cinacalcet) and 9.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dL 
      (+0.8%; placebo), phosphorus levels were 4.5 +/- 1.0 mg/dL (+21.4%) and 4.0 +/- 0.7 
      mg/dL (+6.8%), and calcium-phosphorus product values were 40.1 +/- 8.3 mg(2)/dL(2) 
      (+18.9%) and 38.9 +/- 6.9 mg(2)/dL(2) (+17.1%), respectively. During the study 
      course, 62% (cinacalcet) and 1% (placebo) of participants experienced 2 consecutive 
      serum calcium concentrations less than 8.4 mg/dL. They generally were asymptomatic 
      and without significant clinical consequences. Treatment generally was well 
      tolerated, and most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. LIMITATIONS: 
      The study was not designed to assess the effects of cinacalcet on vascular 
      calcification, bone histomorphometric parameters, or other clinical outcomes. It is 
      not known whether the observed differences in changes in iPTH levels are clinically 
      more important than observed differences in changes in serum calcium or phosphorus 
      levels or dosages of vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data show that cinacalcet treatment in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis can 
      decrease plasma iPTH levels, but with frequent (albeit generally asymptomatic) serum 
      calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL and increases in serum phosphorus levels.

TI  - Hyperhomocysteinaemia and aortic calcification are associated with fractures in 
      patients on haemodialysis.
PG  - 575-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures and atherosclerosis are common in patients with renal failure; 
      this may be due to hyperhomocysteinemia. AIM: To examine the relationships between 
      fractures, vascular calcification and homocysteine levels in haemodialysis patients. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: We enrolled 37 men and 15 women who had 
      been on haemodialysis for at least 1 year. We identified prevalent spine fractures 
      by radiographs. Non-spine fractures were identified by self-report and confirmed by 
      review of radiographs or radiology reports. We classified the presence and severity 
      of lumbar aortic calcifications with lateral lumbar radiographs. We measured serum 
      homocysteine in all subjects within 30 days of study entry. RESULTS: After adjusting 
      for age and weight, increased levels of homocysteine were associated with an 
      increased risk fracture (OR per mmol/l increase in homocysteine 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.0), 
      as was the presence of aortic calcification (OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.1). Homocysteine 
      and lumbar aortic calcification were highly correlated (r = 0.86). DISCUSSION: 
      Hyperhomocysteinaemia may explain the relationship between fractures and 
      atherosclerosis in patients with renal failure.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with vascular 
      calcification, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to 
      estimate the daily dietary phosphorus intake compared with recommendations in CKD 
      patients and to evaluate the reproducibility of the 24-h urinary phosphorus 
      excretion. Twenty CKD patients stage 3-4 from the outpatient clinic, collected 24-h 
      urine and kept dietary records for 3 consecutive days. The mean daily phosphorus 
      intake was 1367±499, 1642±815 and 1426±706 mg/day, respectively (P=0.57). The mean 
      urinary phosphorus excretion was 914±465, 954±414 and 994±479 mg/day, respectively 
      (P=0.21). In this population of CKD patients stage 3-4 the daily phosphorus intake 
      was above the recommended. Twenty-four-hour urinary phosphorus excretion was 
      reproducible and the data indicate that a single 24-h urine collection is sufficient 
      to estimate the individual phosphorus excretion.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem 
      in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular 
      calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate 
      human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. 
      HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels of inorganic phosphate 
      (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in media containing 
      phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 
      mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies 
      showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the 
      osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of 
      elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate 
      cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor 
      phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium 
      deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was 
      identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that 
      elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that 
      predispose to calcification and offers a novel explanation of the phenomenon of 
      vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined 
      the factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic 
      hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular 
      calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the significant factors 
      affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, 
      increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic 
      pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly 
      stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and 
      offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
      hyperphosphatemic conditions.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and progression of aortic arch 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the 
      progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF)-23. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD 
      patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a 
      score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
      subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
      assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors 
      (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis duration in regressors 
      (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors (19.5±7.0 years) and 
      progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors 
      (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in non-progressors 
      (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple 
      regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum 
      levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (β 
      value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of 
      ΔAoACS. CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
      associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
      enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is a major contributor to 
      morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis. The objective of this pilot study was to 
      determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of sodium thiosulfate (STS) in the 
      progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Chronic 
      hemodialysis patients underwent a battery of cardiovascular tests. Those with 
      coronary artery calcium (Agatston scores >50) received intravenous STS after each 
      dialysis for 5 months (n = 22) and the tests were repeated. Changes in 
      MDCT-determined calcification were assessed as the mean annualized rate of change in 
      3 vascular beds (coronary, thoracic and carotid arteries) and in L1-L2 vertebral 
      bone density. RESULTS: Although individual analyses showed coronary artery 
      calcification progression in 14/22 subjects, there was no progression in the mean 
      annualized rate of change of vascular calcification in the entire group. The L1-L2 
      vertebral bone density showed no changes. There were no correlations between rates 
      of progression of vascular calcification and phosphorus, fetuin or C-reactive 
      protein levels. Changes in coronary artery calcification scores correlated with 
      those of the thoracic aorta. CONCLUSION: STS treatment is feasible, appears safe and 
      may decrease the rate of progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients. A large, randomized, controlled trial is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk for arterial intimal 
      (AIC) and medial calcification (AMC). METHODS: In a cross-sectional study on 153 HD 
      patients we evaluated the presence of AIC and AMC using plain radiography of the 
      pelvis and the presence of atherosclerotic lesions using high-resolution B-mode 
      ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries (CCA). RESULTS: The radiography of 
      the pelvis confirmed the frequent presence of AIC (35.3%) and AMC (35.9%) in our HD 
      patients. Arterial calcification was absent (non calcified-NC) in a minority of 
      patients (28.8%). Patients with AIC had significantly higher prevalence of 
      atherosclerotic plaques on CCA (78.6%) compared with both other groups and a higher 
      number of documented atherosclerotic complications, such as cardiovascular (85.2%), 
      cerebrovascular (33.3%) and peripheral arterial disease (38.9%) in comparison with 
      the NC patients. According to the 1-year calculated data from patient records, there 
      were no significant differences in the specific HD risks, such as the dose of 
      prescribed calcium carbonate and vitamin D3, serum levels of calcium, phosphate, 
      calcium-phosphate product and intact parathyroid hormone. All four bone metabolism 
      markers within the range proposed by K/DOQI guidelines were achieved in 9.3%, 14.5% 
      and 20.4% in the AIC, AMC and NC group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIC 
      and AMC are frequently found in the HD population. Screening for arterial 
      calcifications in chronic kidney disease patients is suggested even in the early 
      pre-dialysis period. The highest proportion of patients within the guidelines 
      proposed range for bone and mineral metabolism markers was observed in the NC group. 
      A longer period of data analysis is required in order to evaluate the possible role 
      of some traditional and HD-specific risk factors for the development of arterial 
      calcifications. The achievement of the K/DOQI guidelines is an important issue in 
      the prevention of those conditions.

TI  - Effects of sevelamer on the progression of vascular calcification in patients on 
      chronic haemodialysis.

LID - 10.1159/000127361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a high 
      cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. Control of 
      hyperphosphataemia is important for the treatment of the vascular calcification. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sevelamer hydrochloride on 
      the progression of aortic calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 42 
      HD patients were studied in this study and divided into two groups (sevelamer vs. 
      calcium). Sevelamer was added and titrated up to achieve serum P control for 6 
      months. The estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed 
      tomography scans were performed twice in each patient. We compared the changes in 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and lipids in two groups. 
      RESULTS: Serum phosphorus levels decreased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 
      0.5 mg/dl with no changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels in the 
      sevelamer group (p < 0.01), and increased from 6.5 +/- 1.0 to 6.7 +/- 1.1 mg/dl in 
      the calcium group (p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not change in the sevelamer 
      group and calcium group. The serum levels of total cholesterol decreased 
      significantly from 158.5 +/- 20.7 to 146.2 +/- 24.1 mg/dl (p = 0.024) and the 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level from 65.3 +/- 14.4 to 54.7 +/- 11.6 mg/dl 
      (p = 0.014) in the sevelamer group. Serum C-reactive protein decreased significantly 
      from 0.14 +/- 0.13 to 0.08 +/- 0.11 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (p = 0.038) and 
      significantly increased (0.18 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.12 mg/dl) in the calcium group 
      (p = 0.042). The mean changes in ACI (DeltaACI) were 3.6 +/- 1.5% in the sevelamer 
      group and 8.2 +/- 3.1% in the calcium group. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer allows a better 
      serum phosphorus control compared with calcium-based phosphate binder and suppresses 
      the progression of aortic calcification in HD patients.

TI  - Markers of vascular disease do not differ in black and white hemodialysis patients 
      despite a different risk profile.
PG  - 242-9
AB  - Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
      augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an 
      unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the majority 
      of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data are 
      discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross sectional study 
      we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic 
      aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 
      61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans 
      were performed within a week of each other. There was no difference between races in 
      age, systolic blood pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent 
      history of hypertension (100% versus 89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia 
      (30% versus 66%; P<0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 
      pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% 
      versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 
      28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as 
      CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort 
      there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients 
      despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from 
      the general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer 
      vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and 
      others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise 
      the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in 
      patients of different races and with different risk profiles.

TI  - Circulating nonphosphorylated carboxylated matrix gla protein predicts survival in 
      ESRD.
PG  - 387-95
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2010040339 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms for vascular calcification and its associated cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients with ESRD are not completely understood. Dialysis patients 
      exhibit profound vitamin K deficiency, which may impair carboxylation of the 
      calcification inhibitor matrix gla protein (MGP). Here, we tested whether distinct 
      circulating inactive vitamin K-dependent proteins associate with all-cause or 
      cardiovascular mortality. We observed higher levels of both 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) and desphospho-carboxylated MGP (dp-cMGP) 
      among 188 hemodialysis patients compared with 98 age-matched subjects with normal 
      renal function. Levels of dp-ucMGP correlated with those of protein induced by 
      vitamin K absence II (PIVKA-II; r = 0.62, P < 0.0001). We found increased PIVKA-II 
      levels in 121 (64%) dialysis patients, indicating pronounced vitamin K deficiency. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low levels of dp-cMGP had an 
      increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Multivariable Cox 
      regression confirmed that low levels of dp-cMGP increase mortality risk (all-cause: 
      HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3; cardiovascular: HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.2). 
      Furthermore, patients with higher vascular calcification scores showed lower levels 
      of dp-cMGP. In 17 hemodialysis patients, daily supplementation with vitamin K2 for 6 
      weeks reduced dp-ucMGP levels by 27% (P = 0.003) but did not affect dp-cMGP levels. 
      In conclusion, the majority of dialysis patients exhibit pronounced vitamin K 
      deficiency. Lower levels of circulating dp-cMGP may serve as a predictor of 
      mortality in dialysis patients. Whether vitamin K supplementation improves outcomes 
      requires further study.

TI  - Aortic calcification and femoral bone density are independently associated with left 
      ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e39241

LID - e39241
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in chronic 
      kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is 
      unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone 
      density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic 
      kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, 
      mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic 
      calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 
      48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 
      1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left 
      ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic 
      calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 
      vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 
      ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic 
      calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean 
      femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 
      0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic 
      calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% 
      of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral 
      Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with 
      increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that 
      underlies these relationships is warranted.

TI  - Serum calcification propensity predicts all-cause mortality in predialysis CKD.
PG  - 339-48
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2013060635 [doi]
AB  - Medial arterial calcification is accelerated in patients with CKD and strongly 
      associated with increased arterial rigidity and cardiovascular mortality. Recently, 
      a novel in vitro blood test that provides an overall measure of calcification 
      propensity by monitoring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles in 
      serum was described. We used this test to measure serum T50 in a prospective cohort 
      of 184 patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD, with a median of 5.3 years of follow-up. At 
      baseline, the major determinants of serum calcification propensity included higher 
      serum phosphate, ionized calcium, increased bone osteoclastic activity, and lower 
      free fetuin-A, plasma pyrophosphate, and albumin concentrations, which accounted for 
      49% of the variation in this parameter. Increased serum calcification propensity at 
      baseline independently associated with aortic pulse wave velocity in the complete 
      cohort and progressive aortic stiffening over 30 months in a subgroup of 93 
      patients. After adjustment for demographic, renal, cardiovascular, and biochemical 
      covariates, including serum phosphate, risk of death among patients in the lowest 
      T50 tertile was more than two times the risk among patients in the highest T50 
      tertile (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.4; P=0.04). 
      This effect was lost, however, after additional adjustment for aortic stiffness, 
      suggesting a shared causal pathway. Longitudinally, serum calcification propensity 
      measurements remained temporally stable (intraclass correlation=0.81). These results 
      suggest that serum T50 may be helpful as a biomarker in designing methods to improve 
      defenses against vascular calcification.

TI  - Different risk factors for peripheral vascular calcification between diabetic and 
      non-diabetic haemodialysis patients--importance of glycaemic control.
PG  - 1446-8
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been 
      emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic 
      haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are 
      not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between 
      haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: We examined 421 patients 
      on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II 
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62+/-10 years old) 
      and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59+/-13 years old). Hand 
      roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of the hand 
      arteries was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic 
      patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in 
      diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) ( 
      p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of 
      haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower 
      predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular 
      calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of haemodialysis. In 
      diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk of calcification by 
      2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have shown 
      that poor glycaemic control, rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a 
      predictor of peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on 
      haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in 
      diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Topical Cerium Nitrate-Silver Sulfadiazine Application on 
      Overall Outcome in Patients with Calciphylaxis.
PG  - 120-129
LID - 10.1159/000493975 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis (CPX) is a rare and life-threatening disease characterized 
      by vascular calcification and development of painful and necrotizing skin lesions 
      with a challenging management. Mechanisms of CPX are complex and include an 
      imbalance between vascular calcification promoters and inhibitors, and frequently 
      vitamin K deficiency. OBJECTIVES: To describe the various presentations and identify 
      predictive factors of death in patients with CPX. METHODS: In this multicenter 
      retrospective study, we included 71 CPX patients followed in South-West France (n = 
      26) and in French Polynesia (n = 45), and who all received sodium thiosulfate (25 g 
      thrice weekly for a median of 61 days). RESULTS: Characteristics at presentation 
      significantly differed between metropolitan and Polynesian French patients. 
      Polynesians were less frequently on regular dialysis at the onset of CPX, had a 
      higher incidence of diabetes mellitus and obesity, more disturbances of 
      calcium-phosphorus metabolism, and received vitamin K antagonists less frequently 
      than patients from South-West France. Despite intensive management, the 1-year 
      mortality rate was 66% and median time to death was 200 days (IQR, 40; 514). The 
      number of body areas involved (i.e., three: OR 2.70 [1.09; 6.65], p = 0.031; four: 
      OR 8.79 [1.54; 50.29], p = 0.015) was the only predictive factor for death, whereas 
      application of topical cerium nitrate-silver sulfadiazine was protective (OR 0.44 
      [0.20; 0.99], p = 0.046). Surgical debridement, hyperbaric oxygenation therapy, and 
      geographical origin were not associated with overall outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Cerium 
      nitrate may lead to vascular decalcification and chelation of reactive oxygen 
      species, and prevent infection. Cerium nitrate-silver sulfadiazine was associated 
      with better outcomes and should be tested in a prospective comparative trial in CPX 
      patients.

TI  - Cross-sectional association of serum phosphate with carotid intima-medial thickness 
      in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 859-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although an increased serum phosphate concentration is a significant 
      risk factor for vascular calcification, it is unclear whether serum phosphate level 
      is a risk factor for increased arterial wall thickness in hemodialysis patients. 
      METHODS: Using B-mode ultrasonography, we examined intima-medial thickness (IMT) of 
      the carotid artery of hemodialysis patients and analyzed risk factors for increased 
      IMT with regard to the effect of serum phosphate. Seven hundred sixteen hemodialysis 
      patients were enrolled (547 patients without diabetes, 169 patients with diabetes; 
      441 men, 275 women; age, 60 +/- 8.5 years). RESULTS: IMT of patients with diabetes 
      was significantly greater than that of patients without diabetes (0.859 +/- 0.250 
      versus 0.783 +/- 0.178 mm; P < 0.0001). For the group of all patients, IMT 
      correlated weakly, but significantly, with serum phosphate level (r = 0.093; P = 
      0.0127). In multiple regression analysis of the group of all patients, greater serum 
      phosphate level (beta = 0.166; P < 0.0001) was shown to be a significant independent 
      risk factor for increased carotid IMT, in addition to other significant independent 
      risk factors, including advanced age, higher blood pressure, greater 
      non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and the presence of diabetes (R2 = 
      0.1119; P < 0.00001). In multiple regression analyses performed separately for 
      hemodialysis patients without and with diabetes, greater phosphate level and 
      advanced age were significant independent risk factors for increased IMT, 
      independent of other confounding risk factors. CONCLUSION: These results show that 
      in addition to advanced age, greater serum phosphate level is a significant and 
      independent factor associated with advanced arteriosclerosis in hemodialysis 
      patients with and without diabetes, suggesting that phosphate levels should be 
      controlled appropriately to prevent an increase in arterial wall thickness in 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - AIMS: The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality is increased in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a background role of vascular 
      calcification in the development of CVD also reported. Studies have demonstrated 
      that high lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels accelerate the development of 
      atherosclerolsis and are potentially involved in the vascular calcification. Matrix 
      Gla Protein (MGP) seems to play an important role in vascular calcification. The aim 
      of the study was to examine the potential association of MGP concentrations with 
      Lp(a) and insulin resistance. METHODS: The study involved 100patients divided in 
      four groups: 25 with both CKD stage 4 and Type2 Diabetes (DM) (Group-A), 25 with 
      CKD4 without DM (Group-B), 25 non uremic patients with DM (Group-C) and 25 healthy 
      subjects (Group-D). Serum glucose, Lp(a), MGP, plasma HBA1c and insulin were 
      measured in all patients. Insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostasis model 
      assessment equation (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: A significant positive linear association 
      between MGP and Lp(a) levels (r=0.272, p=0.006) was noted, as well as between MGP 
      and HOMA-IR levels (r=0.308, p=0.002). However, no significant linear association 
      between Lp(a) and HOMA-IR levels was recorded. A similar positive association 
      between MGP and insulin levels (r=0.204, p=0.042) was also found. CONCLUSION: This 
      study concluded that diabetes coexisting with renal disease leads to extreme 
      vascular calcification expressed by elevated MGP levels, resulting in higher 
      frequency of cardiovascular disease in comparison to CKD patients without diabetes. 
      The detected Lp(a) and MGP association in CKD4 patients may also represent the key 
      to the complicated mechanism of their coexisting accelerated atherosclerosis and 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - The progression of vascular calcification and serum osteoprotegerin levels in 
      patients on long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aortic calcification index (ACI), estimated on abdominal computed 
      tomographic scans, has been associated with the extent of arteriosclerosis in 
      hemodialysis patients. However, the contribution of biochemical markers to the 
      progression of vascular calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis is not 
      fully understood. METHODS: We examined the relationship between coronary risk 
      factors; metabolic factors, including serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) concentration; and 
      progression of vascular calcification in 26 dialysis patients. RESULTS: Mean patient 
      age was 52.6 +/- 8.7 (SD) years, and mean duration of dialysis therapy was 7.7 +/- 
      5.8 years. ACI was measured twice in each patient, and the mean interscan period was 
      4.9 +/- 0.3 years. Mean ACI changed from 22.2 +/- 24.2 to 33.9 +/- 28.8 overall, and 
      mean change in ACI (DeltaACI) was 12.0 +/- 9.9. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 
      slow progressors, with DeltaACI of 4.1 +/- 3.2 (n = 13), and rapid progressors, with 
      DeltaACI of 19.8 +/- 7.9 (n = 13). Serum fasting glucose and CRP levels of rapid 
      progressors were high, and their serum albumin and intact parathyroid hormone levels 
      were low. Multiple regression analyses showed that serum OPG levels were 
      independently associated with vascular calcification in the hemodialysis patients 
      studied. CONCLUSION: Rapid progression of vascular calcification was associated with 
      dose of calcium carbonate prescribed and serum OPG concentration. The clinical 
      significance of these observations remains to be determined.

TI  - Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium score: 
      comparison between transplantation and dialysis.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent 
      ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences 
      between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity 
      of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately 
      in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, 
      divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; 
      previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 
      mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 
      5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by 
      cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of 
      divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) 
      and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary 
      calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three 
      calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with 
      age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 
      0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a 
      correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other 
      markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression 
      analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and 
      C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most 
      predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age 
      and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
      condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as 
      compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition 
      proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower 
      prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating 
      role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary 
      calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value 
      to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular 
      lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

TI  - Cardiac vascular calcification and QT interval in ESRD patients: is there a link?
PG  - 451-9
AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
      between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
      studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 +/- 
      27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 
      years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good 
      mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 
      4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 
      mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than 
      CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in 
      both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification 
      than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher 
      or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), 
      frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), 
      parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). 
      The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores 
      (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients 
      with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in 
      both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, 
      age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium 
      x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
      of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac 
      calcification in uraemic patients.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and carotid atherosclerosis.
PG  - 47-51
LID - 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2010.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The 
      association between carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and chronic kidney disease 
      is controversial, however. In addition, whether renal dysfunction promotes vascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease is not clear. The study 
      subjects were 1003 patients aged ≥50 years who underwent carotid ultrasonography in 
      our hospital. Kidney function was evaluated based on the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Patients with end-stage 
      renal failure were excluded. We measured the mean max-IMT (which indicates mean 
      maximal wall thickness) at 12 carotid segments, and examined the characteristics of 
      the maximal plaques by carotid ultrasonography. We evaluated the association between 
      mean max-IMT and eGFR, and also evaluated the clinical factors associated with mean 
      max-IMT and calcification of the maximal plaques. We found that eGFR was 
      significantly correlated with mean max-IMT. Reduced eGFR, proteinuria, age, male 
      sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking were independently 
      associated with mean max-IMT in multiple regression analysis. Kidney function was 
      not associated with calcified plaque. Kidney dysfunction was associated with carotid 
      atherosclerosis in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Plasma fibroblast growth factor-23 levels are independently associated with carotid 
      artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 425-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2010.00480.x [doi]
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque identification 
      using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of 
      atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might 
      be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured 
      using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode 
      Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 
      63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are 
      on HD thrice a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing 
      tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, 
      P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than 
      patients free of plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant 
      correlation was recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In 
      multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant 
      independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify 
      whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for 
      atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - Serum fetuin-A is associated with the components of MIAC(malnutrition, inflammation, 
      atherosclerosis, calcification) syndrome in different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.3906/sag-1809-43 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Fetuin-A, a circulating inhibitor of calcification, is a marker of 
      inflammatory-nutritional state. We evaluated the association between serum fetuin-A 
      levels and vascular calcification, intima-media thickness, and nutritional and 
      inflammatory markers in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: CKD patients were sampled for calcium-phosphate parameters and 
      nutritional and inflammatory markers [highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)], 
      and serum fetuin-A levels. Intima-media thicknesses of the common carotid arteries 
      (CIMT) were measured. Peripheral artery calcification scores were obtained. RESULTS: 
      A total of 238 patients were included in the study. Fetuin-A levels in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease were significantly lower than those in patients with stage-3 
      and stage-4 CKD (stage-5 vs. stage-4, P < 0.001; stage-5 vs. stage-3, P < 0.001). 
      Fetuin-A was negatively correlated with creatinine (P < 0.001), Ca × P product (P < 
      0.001), hs-CRP (P = 0.01), vascular calcification score (P < 0.001), and CIMT (P < 
      0.001), and positively correlated with BMI (P < 0.001, r = 0.30) and serum albumin 
      (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Lower levels of fetuin-A were associated with higher 
      vascular calcification scores, CIMT, hs-CRP levels, and lower BMI and albumin. 
      Fetuin-A deficiency may be a key element for MIAC syndrome.

AB  - AIM: Both vascular calcification and atherosclerosis are highly prevalent in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and have been associated with increased 
      cardiovascular morbidity. Because those two phenomena might be only coincidentally 
      related in chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients, in this study, coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), common carotid artery intima media thickness (CCA-IMT) and 
      thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery were simultaneously 
      measured. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 47 HD patients (31 male, mean age 
      56.8 +/- 11.4 years, and 16 female, mean age 56.0 +/- 7.5 years) without history of 
      major cardiovascular complications. CCA-IMT and presence and thickness of 
      atherosclerotic plaques were measured with ultrasound and CAC with multidetector 
      computed tomography. RESULTS: The CAC were present in 70.2% of patients. The mean 
      CAC was 1055 +/- 232, the mean CCA-IMT was 0.96 +/- 0.21. The atherosclerotic 
      plaques in the common carotid arteries were visualized in 38 patients (80.1%), the 
      mean thickness of the atherosclerotic plaque was 1.61 +/- 0.8 mm. We found a 
      significant positive correlation between CAC and CCA-IMT (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). The 
      thickness of atherosclerosis plaque positively correlated with CAC as well as with 
      CCA-IMT (r = 0.60, P < 0.001 and r = 0.7, P < 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: The 
      study revealed close relationships between CAC, intima media thickness and the 
      thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in dialysis patients. It may indicate that both 
      vascular calcification and atherosclerotic lesions frequently coexist in patients 
      with ESRD and that the intima media thickness could serve as a surrogate marker of 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - The relationship between the Spine Deformity Index, biochemical parameters of bone 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications: results from the Epidemiological VERtebral 
      FRACtures iTalian Study (EVERFRACT) in dialysis patients.
PG  - 1595-603

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures 
      (VFs), providing information on both their number and severity. METHODS: We 
      evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical and arterial 
      calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, assessed by 
      quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were identified in 
      the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of fracture severity, we 
      created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the number of VFs. We assessed 
      routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), undercaboxylated BGP (ucBGP), and 
      matrix-Gla-protein (MGP). RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD patients with a SDI 
      >1 were more frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP (p<0.01). Patients with a 
      c-SDI >1 had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP 
      (p<0.05). Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC) were more frequent in 
      patients with SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic 
      regression showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91), age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) 
      and albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 
      1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI 1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, CI 
      0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity 
      of VFs was associated with age, atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

TI  - Circulating Dephospho-Uncarboxylated Matrix Gla-Protein Is Associated With Kidney 
      Dysfunction and Arterial Stiffness.
PG  - 988-994
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy079 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Large artery stiffening is increased in advanced chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) but likely develops progressively in earlier stages of CKD. Active matrix 
      Gla-protein (MGP) is a potent vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification. A recent animal model demonstrated intrinsic abnormalities in vitamin 
      K metabolism even in early CKD, but whether early human CKD is associated with 
      vascular vitamin K deficiency is unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 137 adults without HF 
      with varying degrees of renal function: normal estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR; >90 ml/min; n = 59), mildly reduced eGFR (stage 2 CKD: eGFR = 60-89 ml/min; n 
      = 53) or at least moderately reduced eGFR (stage 3-5 CKD; eGFR < 60 ml/min; n = 25). 
      Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) was measured with carotid and femoral 
      tonometry. Dephospho-uncarboxylated matrix gla-protein (dp-ucMGP) was measured with 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (VitaK; Maastricht University; The 
      Netherlands). RESULT: Dp-ucMGP levels were progressively increased with decreasing 
      renal function (eGFR ≥ 90: 247 pmol/l; eGFR 60-89: 488 pmol/l; eGFR < 60: 953 
      pmol/l; P < 0.0001). These differences persisted after adjustment for multiple 
      potential confounders (eGFR ≥ 90: 314 pmol/l; eGFR 60-89: 414 pmol/l; eGFR < 60: 770 
      pmol/l; P < 0.0001). In a multivariable model adjusted for various confounders, 
      dp-ucMGP was a significant independent predictor of CF-PWV (β = 0.21; P = 0.019). In 
      formal mediation analyses, dp-ucMGP mediated a significant relationship between eGFR 
      and higher CF-PWV (β = -0.16; P = 0.005), whereas no significant 
      dp-ucMGP-independent relationship was present (β = -0.02; P = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: 
      CKD is associated with increased (inactive) dp-ucMGP, a vitamin K-dependent 
      inhibitor of vascular calcification, which correlates with large artery stiffness. 
      Further studies are needed to assess whether vitamin K2 supplementation represents a 
      suitable therapeutic strategy to prevent or reduce arterial stiffening in CKD.

TI  - Assessment and significance of abdominal aortic calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1888-95
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp728 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification is a common complication and a predictor 
      of cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. However, abdominal aortic 
      calcification in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is poorly understood. 
      METHODS: A cohort study of 101 adult Japanese patients (mean age 66.6 +/- 11.3 years 
      old) with pre-dialysis CKD (18, 29 and 54 in stages 3, 4 and 5, respectively) was 
      performed. At entry, a non-contrast computed tomography scan was used to determine 
      the abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI). Clinical characteristics and 
      laboratory variables were also assessed. The patients were followed for a mean 
      period of 48 +/- 12 months. RESULTS: Among the subjects, 82% had abdominal aortic 
      calcification (50, 83 and 91% for CKD stages 3, 4 and 5, respectively), and the 
      median ACI was 16.7% (8.5, 20.0 and 21.4%, respectively). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analyses identified older age, presence of diabetes and decreased 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) as independent predictors of the 
      presence (ACI > 0%) and extent (ACI >or= 20%) of aortic calcification. Multivariate 
      Cox proportional hazards analysis identified ACI >or= 20% and diabetes as 
      independent predictors for de novo cardiovascular events in CKD stages 4 and 5. 
      CONCLUSION: Decreased GFR may be associated with the presence and extent of 
      abdominal aortic calcification, and a high level of calcification may be associated 
      with de novo cardiovascular events in pre-dialysis CKD, suggesting that elucidation 
      of the mechanism through which CKD contributes to vascular calcification may lead to 
      an improved prognosis in patients with pre-dialysis CKD.

LID - 17941
AB  - Vascular calcification is a component of cardiovascular disease, which is leading 
      cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A functional assay 
      (T50-test) measuring the propensity of human serum to calcify associates with 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in CKD patients. Calcification propensity is 
      known to increase with CKD stage. We investigated whether the T50 readout is 
      directly dependent on excretory kidney function (eGFR) or rather explained by 
      deranged parameters of bone and mineral metabolism in the course of CKD. T50, along 
      with markers implicated in calcification and mineral metabolism, were measured in a 
      cross-sectional cohort of 118 patients with CKD stage 1-5. Associations of T50 with 
      measured parameters were analysed and partial correlations performed to test to 
      which extent the association of T50 with eGFR can be attributed to variation of 
      these parameters. T50 correlates with eGFR, but serum levels of phosphate and 
      calcium largely explain this association. Phosphate, magnesium, fetuin A, albumin, 
      bicarbonate, and serum cross-laps but not Parathyroid Hormone or Fibroblast Growth 
      Factor 23 are associated with T50 in multivariate adjusted models. These findings 
      indicate that T50 values depend mainly on the concentration of promoters and 
      inhibitors of calcification in serum, but not excretory kidney function.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification in the Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil).
PG  - 1309-1315
LID - 10.1002/clc.22829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health concern due to the 
      increased prevalence the high fatalities related to heart disease in this 
      population. Among novel cardiovascular risk markers, the coronary artery 
      calcification score (CAC) emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular 
      events. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to test if glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria 
      are independently associated with coronary calcification. METHODS: The Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health is a cohort of men and women aged 35 to 74 years 
      old addressing cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the association of CAC, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 
      according to stages of eGFR (1 = ≥90; 2 = 60-89; 3 = <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ), and ACR 
      (<30; 30 to 300; >300 mg/g). These associations were estimated by logistic 
      regression with a model including age, sex, race, income, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors. RESULTS: Among 4189 persons (median age = 51 years, 54% women), 1183 had 
      CAC. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in the 
      multivariate model was 0.86 (0.58-1.29) for the category of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2) compared to people with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m(2) . On the other hand, the OR 
      (95% CI) for individuals with ACR >300 mg/g was 4.31 (1.27-14.64) compared to people 
      with ACR <30 mg/g. A discrete interaction factor for the association with CAC 
      between eGFR and ACR were analyzed as continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria 
      was independently associated with coronary calcification, but the reduction of the 
      glomerular filtration rate was not associated with CAC score in this sample of 
      apparently healthy adults.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification measured with electron-beam computerized tomography 
      correlates poorly with coronary artery angiography in dialysis patients.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification measured by electron-beam computerized 
      tomography (EBCT) correlates with plaque burden and vessel stenosis and is 
      predictive of future cardiac events in the general population. Uremic vascular 
      calcification is common and widespread, tends to be medial as well as intimal, and 
      may not relate solely to atherosclerotic lesions. Despite this difference and in the 
      absence of any direct evidence in uremic patients, it is generally implied that 
      coronary artery calcification equates to occlusive atherosclerosis. METHODS: We set 
      out to compare the predictive value of coronary artery calcification assessed by 
      EBCT with contemporaneous coronary angiography. We studied 18 patients with 
      end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance dialysis. Seventy-two coronary 
      vessels were analyzed for angiographic evidence of stenotic disease and correlated 
      with individual vessel calcification score. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      correlation between degree of vessel stenosis and calcification score for individual 
      vessels in patients with a positive calcium scan. Specificity was 48% and the 
      positive predictive value was 53%. However, a calcification score <20 strongly 
      correlated with the absence of significant luminal narrowing, and a 0 calcification 
      score had a negative predictive value of 87.5%. CONCLUSION: Coronary artery 
      calcification measured by EBCT is not an accurate marker of the degree of vessel 
      stenosis in coronary artery disease in uremic patients and should not be used as a 
      single screening test for atherosclerotic coronary disease.

TI  - Active vitamin D and accelerated progression of aortic stiffness in hemodialysis 
      patients: a longitudinal observational study.
PG  - 1346-54
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpu057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that high-dose active vitamin D therapy in the form of 
      alphacalcidol (α-calcidol), used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic 
      kidney disease, could lead to vascular calcification and accelerated progression of 
      aortic stiffness. METHODS: We conducted an observational study in 85 patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis, among which 70 were taking a weekly dose of α-calcidol of <2 
      µg and 15 were taking a weekly dose of ≥2 µg (pharmacological dose). Parathyroid 
      hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23, and α-klotho were 
      determined. Aortic stiffness was assessed by determination of carotid-femoral pulse 
      wave velocity (cf-PWV) at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. A 
      multivariable regression model was used to evaluate the impact of pharmacological 
      dose of α-calcidol on the progression of aortic stiffness. RESULTS: At baseline, 
      clinical, biological, and hemodynamic parameters were similar. At follow-up, cf-PWV 
      increased more in patients with pharmacological dose of α-calcidol (0.583±2.291 m/s 
      vs. 1.948±1.475 m/s; P = 0.04). After adjustment for changes in mean blood pressure 
      and duration of follow-up, pharmacological dose of α-calcidol was associated with a 
      higher rate of progression of cf-PWV (0.969 m/s; 95% confidence interval = 
      0.111-1.827; P = 0.03), and this association persisted after further adjustments for 
      parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, pharmacological dose 
      of α-calcidol was associated with accelerated progression of aortic stiffness. This 
      study suggest that the vascular safety of active vitamin D posology may need to be 
      specifically addressed in the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related bone 
      mineral disorder.

TI  - Myocardial calcification and cardiac dysfunction in chronic renal failure.
PG  - 651-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Myocardial calcium content may have clinical importance in end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD), but it is difficult to detect during life. Our goal was to assess 
      the effect of myocardial calcium content on left ventricular ejection fraction 
      (LVEF) in uremic patients undergoing dialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Energy 
      subtraction radiography of the chest was used to measure myocardial calcium content 
      in 43 patients undergoing dialysis, in 32 control subjects, and in nine patients 
      with advanced cardiomyopathy. LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension were 
      measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. The concentration of parathyroid 
      hormone was measured by radioimmunoassay; calcium-phosphorus product, alkaline 
      phosphatase, and serum bicarbonate were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients undergoing 
      dialysis had a greater myocardial calcium content than control subjects [262 +/- 
      15.4 (mean +/- SE) versus 187 +/- 8 mg/cm2, p less than 0.05]. Ten patients with the 
      highest myocardial calcium content (Group I) had the lowest LVEF values and highest 
      left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. Significant inverse linear associations 
      between LVEF and myocardial calcium content (r = -0.425, p = 0.013) and between 
      parathyroid hormone concentration and LVEF (r = -0.352, p = 0.047) were noted. There 
      was no association between parathyroid hormone concentration and myocardial calcium 
      content. Stepwise regression analysis showed a strong positive correlation between 
      myocardial calcium content and calcium-phosphorus product, vascular calcification, 
      race (black), and parathyroidectomy. Similar analysis shows that LVEF was 
      significantly associated with myocardial calcium content, lung calcium, 
      calcium-phosphorus product, and race (black). CONCLUSION: We suggest that increased 
      myocardial calcium content results from poor calcium and phosphorus control and may 
      be enhanced by parathyroid hormone hyperactivity. Increased myocardial calcium 
      content is strongly associated with myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing 
      dialysis.

TI  - Circulating calcification inhibitors and vascular properties in children after renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 985-93
LID - 10.1007/s00467-007-0743-4 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric transplant patients are known to have vascular abnormalities. The 
      calcification inhibitors matrix Gla protein (MGP) and fetuin-A play an important 
      role in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. In the cross-sectional study 
      reported here, we examined the circulating levels of fetuin-A and MGP in children 
      after renal transplantation compared to healthy children and the association of 
      these factors with vascular properties of the carotid artery. Levels of MGP and 
      fetuin-A together with vascular properties of the carotid artery were determined in 
      29 pediatric renal transplant recipients and 54 healthy controls. The level of 
      fetuin-A was decreased in the transplant group relative to the control group 
      (P=0.005), whereas the level of MGP (both non-phosphorylated MGP and 
      non-carboxylated MGP) did not differ between groups. The intima-media thickness 
      (P<0.001) and the elasticity (P=0.002) of the carotid artery were significantly 
      increased in children after renal transplantation compared to healthy children. No 
      associations between vascular parameters and calcification inhibitors were found in 
      either group. Circulating levels of MGP and fetuin-A could not be identified as 
      independent predictors of vascular stiffness or other carotid artery parameters in 
      pediatric renal transplant recipients. Future prospective studies in pediatric ESRD 
      and transplant patients are needed to learn more about the role of calcification 
      inhibitors in relation to the prevention of vascular damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on 
      plaque morphology in cerebral vessels. We therefore analyzed plaque composition and 
      metabolic and chemical parameters with regard to clinical outcome in patients with 
      advanced carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and normal or impaired renal function. 
      METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy plaques were collected from 114 patients, 51 with 
      CKD and 63 without CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 49 ± 9 vs 88 ± 14 
      mL/min), and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of matrix 
      metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -9), calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone, fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin, and inflammatory factors, including fibrinogen, 
      and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by appropriate 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Compared with patients without CKD, 
      patients with CKD had significantly more early-stage (11.2% vs 2.8%, P = .002) and 
      end-stage (7.4% vs 0.2%, P = .036) calcification, unstable (50.8% vs 20.4%, P = 
      .001) and ruptured (53.1% vs 32.8%, P = .035) lesions, and a significantly lower 
      amount of collagenous fibers (39.2% vs 54.6%, P = .001). Serum samples of CKD 
      patients had significantly enhanced levels of fibrinogen (393 ± 88 vs 331 ± 60 
      mg/dL, P = .018), hsCRP (1.7 ± 2.9 vs 0.8 ± 0.9 mg/dL; P = .042), parathyroid 
      hormone (47.3 ± 24.1 vs 32.8 ± 12.2 ng/L, P = .010), fetuin-A (0.21 ± 0.05 vs 0.18 ± 
      0.04 mg/mL, P = .039), and MMP-7 (13.0 ± 5.3 vs 8.3 ± 3.0 ng/mL; P < 0.001). The 
      incidence of cerebrovascular events >6 months before carotid surgery was 
      significantly increased in CKD patients (84.0% vs 26.2% P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with CKD and advanced carotid artery stenosis, morphologic changes in 
      plaque composition may contribute to plaque vulnerability and consequently to the 
      risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, relevant serum markers of inflammation, 
      vascular calcification, and vessel wall degradation might be an indication of stroke 
      risk in CKD patients.

AB  - AIM: To determine the associations between insulin resistance, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF-23), and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. INTRODUCTION: FGF-23 is associated with atherosclerosis and 
      cardiovascular disease, but its association with insulin resistance in CKD has not 
      been explored. SUBJECTS: Cross sectional study of 72 stage 3-5 CKD patients 
      receiving care in Ontario, Canada. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin resistance was 
      measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), FGF-23 
      was measured by carboxyl terminal enzyme linked immunoassay (ctFGF-23) and CAC was 
      measured by multi-slice computed tomography. RESULTS: Median HOMA-IR was 2.19μU/ml 
      (interquartile range 1.19 to 3.94). Patients with HOMA-IR>2.2 had greater ctFGF-23 
      (179.7 vs 109.6; P=0.03), and 40% higher log CAC scores (2.09±0.87 vs 1.58±1.26; 
      P=0.049). Multivariable linear regression adjusted for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, 
      kidney function, and parathyroid hormone revealed insulin resistance was a risk 
      factor for greater log ctFGF-23 levels (log HOMA IR β=0.37; 95% confidence interval 
      0.14 to 0.59; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistant CKD patients demonstrated 
      higher FGF-23 levels, and increased CAC, while PO4 levels remained normal, 
      suggesting a potential link between insulin resistance and PO4 homeostasis in CKD.

TI  - Vascular calcification as a source of hand pain and weakness in a patient with 
      end-stage renal failure.
PG  - 426-7
AB  - This article describes a unique case of vascular calcification of the hands 
      complicated by pain and weakness. The case demonstrates the interaction of the 
      skeletal and renal systems and the consequences of an unrecognized imbalance of 
      calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Definitive medical management to keep the 
      calcium-phosphate product below 70 through the judicious use of aluminum phosphate 
      binders and diet should be coordinated to prevent and limit the extent of these 
      calcifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is known as a circulating inhibitor of vascular calcification. 
      Factors associated with serum fetuin-A concentrations after long-term use of 
      different phosphate binders in hemodialysis patients is still uncertain. METHODS: In 
      the post-hoc study, we analyzed serum fetuin-A and biochemical factors (Ca, P, 
      i-PTH, hsCRP, TG, LDL-C) in 50 hemodialysis patients, who completed a 48-week, 
      open-Label, controlled randomized parallel-group study. 23 patients received 
      sevelamer and 27 patients received calcium carbonate. RESULTS: After the 48-week 
      treatment, the sevelamer group had less serum calcium increment, less iPTH 
      decrement, more ALK-P increment, more hsCRP decrement and more LDL-C decrement. 
      There was no significant difference in the serum fetuin-A decrement between two 
      groups. Decreased serum fetuin-A levels were found after 48-week treatment in both 
      groups: from 210.61 (104.73) to 153.85 (38.64) ug/dl, P = 0.003 in sevelamer group, 
      from 203.95 (107.87) to 170.90 (58.02) ug/mL, P =0.002 in calcium group. The 
      decrement in serum fetuin-A (Δfetuin-A) levels was associated with ΔCa (ρ = - 0.230, 
      P = 0.040), ΔiPTH (ρ = 0.306, P = 0.031) and Δalbumin (ρ = 0.408, P = 0.003), not 
      associated with sevelamer use, ΔP and ΔhsCRP. CONCLUSION: After long-term sevelamer 
      or calcium carbonate treatment, both groups of maintenance HD patients had lower 
      serum fetuin-A levels. Serum levels of increased calcium, decreased iPTH and 
      decreased albumin were associated with the serum fetuin-A decrement.

TI  - Sevelamer carbonate lowers serum phosphorus effectively in haemodialysis patients: a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study.
PG  - 152-60
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphataemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) is associated with adverse outcomes, including vascular calcification and 
      higher mortality rates. While phosphate lowering is an integral aspect of CKD 
      management, the efficacy and safety of phosphate binders in a contemporary cohort of 
      Chinese haemodialysis patients (who have different genetics and dietary patterns 
      than other populations) has not been previously described. Moreover, sparse data are 
      available on strategies for optimal dose titration when transitioning from a 
      calcium-based to a polymer-based phosphate binder. METHODS: This randomized, 
      double-blind, dose-titration study compared sevelamer carbonate (starting dose 800 
      mg three times daily) with placebo over 8 weeks' duration in Chinese CKD patients on 
      haemodialysis. Patients were required to be using calcium-based binders prior to 
      study start. RESULTS: In all, 205 patients were randomized (sevelamer, n = 135; 
      placebo, n = 70); mean age was 48.6 years, 61% were male and the mean time on 
      dialysis was 4.4 years. The mean serum phosphorus decreased significantly in 
      patients treated with sevelamer carbonate [change -0.69 ± 0.64 mmol/L (-2.14 ± 1.98 
      mg/dL)] but remained persistently elevated with placebo [change -0.06 ± 0.57 mmol/L 
      (-0.19 ± 1.76 mg/dL)] (P < 0.0001). When compared with placebo, sevelamer carbonate 
      treatment resulted in statistically significant greater mean reductions from 
      baseline in serum total (-17.1 versus -3.3%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (-33.5 versus-7.6%) (P < 0.0001 for both). Sevelamer carbonate was well tolerated 
      with 96% adherence compared with 97% adherence in the placebo arm. Overall, adverse 
      events experienced by patients in the sevelamer carbonate and placebo treatment 
      groups were similar and consistent with their underlying renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study demonstrated that hyperphosphataemia developed quickly following the 
      cessation of phosphate binders and remained persistently elevated in end-stage CKD 
      in the placebo-treated group. Gradually titrating up sevelamer carbonate from an 
      initial dose of 2.4 g/day to an average daily dose of 7.1 ± 2.5 g/day was well 
      tolerated, safe and efficacious in contemporary Chinese haemodialysis patients.

TI  - [MORPHOGENETIC PROTEINS--FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR AND KLOTHO, IN THE SERA OF 
      PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE].
PG  - 32-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of morphogenetic proteins--fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and extracellular form (alpha) of Klotho protein, present 
      in the sera of patients with chronic renal disease (CRD) as markers of 
      cardiovascular risk. The study included 130 patients (64 men and 66 women) with 
      stage I-VD CRD. The patients'age was 20-65 (mean 41 ± 6.7) years. 30 of them had 
      chronic glomerulonephritis, 23 chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, 28 hypertensive 
      nephrosclerosis, 22 polycystic kidneys, 27 type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria were standardfor clinical studies of CRD patients. Control group 
      contained 30 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. The patients were uniformly 
      distributed by stages of CRD in terms of age and sex (18-20 per group). All of them 
      were followed up during 1 year Standard clinical and laboratory examination was 
      supplemented by the measurement of the parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca and P levels. 
      Serum FGF-23 and Klotho levels were determined by ELISA before and 1 year after 
      onset of the study. Blood pressure including brachial (peripheral) and aortic 
      (central) one as swell as the pulse wave velocity was measured by a Sphygocorr 
      apparatus (Australia). Other studies included ECG, EchoCG, and X-ray of abdominal 
      aorta in the lateral projection using the Kaupilla method. Comparison of FGF-23 and 
      Klotho levels in patients at different stages of CRD revealed their decrease with 
      decreasing glomerular filtration rate that started before (at IIIA stage) a rise in 
      the serum P and PTG levels (IV-V stage). Negative relationship was documented 
      between the Klotho level and the degree of cardiac calcinosis estimated from a 
      semi-quantitative scale (r = 0.64; p < 0.01). Serum FGF-23 significantly correlated 
      wiht myocardial remodeling (r = 0.612; p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis 
      showed that patients with elevated FGF-23 and P levels, high central systolic 
      pressure and pulse wave velocity had greater left ventricular myocardium mass. 
      ROC-analysis demonstrated that FGF-23 level over 412 pg/ml is indicative of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy with sensitivity 80% and specificity 76%. Patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis who died within 1 year after the onset of the treatment had 
      a higher FGF-23 level than survivals on hemodialysis. The risk of death during the 
      first year on hemodialysis correlated with the FGF-23 level (r = 0.564, p < 0.01). 
      ROC-analysis showed that Klotho levels below 387 pg/ml suggested an increased risk 
      of myocardiym calcification with sensitivity 80% and specificity 75%. It is 
      concluded that morphogenetic proteins, fibroblast growth factor and Klotho, not only 
      play an important role in mineral metabolism in patients with CRD but also produce 
      pleiotropic effects on the development of cardiovascular complications (via 
      involvement in cardiac and vascular calcification and remodeling). It provides a 
      basis for the use of these proteins as early markers of cardiovascular risk in CRD 
      patients.

AB  - Currently, there is no available data about Vitamin D status among Egyptian chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients. This cross-sectional study is looking for the 
      prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among Stage 3a-5 CKD Egyptian patients and its 
      possible associations. We studied 1624 Stage 3a-5 CKD adults (689 males and 935 
      females) together with 200 normal control persons. All the recruited candidates were 
      tested for body mass index (BMI); serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
      calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25 hydroxy vitamin D 
      (25(OH)D), albumin, and uric acid (UA); urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate. The optimal level of Vitamin D was encountered 
      in only 1.4% of CKD patients versus 52% of the normal controls. A total of 1107 
      (68.2%) CKD patients versus 23 (11.5%) controls had serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL (mean ± 
      standard deviation = 16.8 ± 5.8 versus 37.3±7.6 ng/mL for CKD versus control group, 
      respectively, P <0.001). There was a highly statistically significant positive 
      correlation between serum 25(OH)D and serum Ca (r = 0.299, P <0.001) and a highly 
      statistically significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D on the one hand 
      and serum P, serum PTH, serum UA, and urine ACR on the other hand (r = -0.46, -0.69, 
      -0.73, and -0.8, respectively, P <0.001). Vitamin D deficiency is very common among 
      Egyptian CKD patients. Serum P, UA, and urine ACR ratio are the most important 
      variables which are found to be negatively associated with serum 25(OH)D.

TI  - Medial fibrosis, vascular calcification, intimal hyperplasia, and arteriovenous 
      fistula maturation.
PG  - 437-43
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently fail to mature 
      because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The pathogenesis of AVF 
      nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing vascular pathologic states: medial 
      fibrosis or microcalcification may limit arterial dilation, and intimal hyperplasia 
      may cause stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50) undergoing AVF placement. PREDICTORS: 
      Medial fibrosis, microcalcification, and intimal hyperplasia in arteries and veins 
      obtained during AVF creation. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: AVF nonmaturation. RESULTS: 
      AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38% of patients despite attempted salvage procedures. 
      Preoperative arterial diameter was associated with upper-arm AVF maturation (P = 
      0.007). Medial fibrosis was similar in patients with nonmaturing and mature AVFs 
      (60% ± 14% vs 66% ± 13%; P = 0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not associated with patient 
      age or diabetes, although both variables were associated significantly with severe 
      medial fibrosis. Conversely, AVF nonmaturation was higher in women than men despite 
      similar medial fibrosis in both sexes. Arterial microcalcification (assessed 
      semiquantitatively) tended to be associated with AVF nonmaturation (1.3 ± 0.8 vs 0.9 
      ± 0.8; P = 0.08). None of the arteries or veins obtained at AVF creation had intimal 
      hyperplasia. However, repeated venous samples obtained in 6 patients during surgical 
      revision of an immature AVF showed venous neointimal hyperplasia. LIMITATIONS: 
      Single-center study. CONCLUSION: Medial fibrosis and microcalcification are frequent 
      in arteries used to create AVFs, but do not explain AVF nonmaturation. Unlike 
      previous studies, intimal hyperplasia was not present at baseline, but developed de 
      novo in nonmaturing AVFs.

TI  - Can we IMPROVE cardiovascular outcomes through phosphate lowering in CKD? Rationale 
      and protocol for the IMpact of Phosphate Reduction On Vascular End-points in Chronic 
      Kidney Disease (IMPROVE-CKD) study.
PG  - e024382

LID - e024382
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at heightened 
      cardiovascular risk, which has been associated with abnormalities of bone and 
      mineral metabolism. A deeper understanding of these abnormalities should facilitate 
      improved treatment strategies and patient-level outcomes, but at present there are 
      few large, randomised controlled clinical trials to guide management. Positive 
      associations between serum phosphate and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both the general and CKD populations have 
      resulted in clinical guidelines suggesting that serum phosphate be targeted towards 
      the normal range, although few randomised and placebo-controlled studies have 
      addressed clinical outcomes using interventions to improve phosphate control. Early 
      preventive measures to reduce the development and progression of vascular 
      calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial stiffness are crucial in 
      patients with CKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We outline the rationale and protocol for 
      an international, multicentre, randomised parallel-group trial assessing the impact 
      of the non-calcium-based phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate, compared with 
      placebo on surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in a predialysis CKD 
      population-the IM pact of P hosphate R eduction O n V ascular E nd-points 
      (IMPROVE)-CKD study. The primary objective of the IMPROVE-CKD study is to determine 
      if the use of lanthanum carbonate reduces the burden of cardiovascular disease in 
      patients with CKD stages 3b and 4 when compared with placebo. The primary end-point 
      of the study is change in arterial compliance measured by pulse wave velocity over a 
      96-week period. Secondary outcomes include change in aortic calcification and 
      biochemical parameters of serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone and FGF-23 levels. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the IMPROVE-CKD trial was obtained by 
      each local Institutional Ethics Committee for all 17 participating sites in 
      Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia prior to study commencement. Results of this 
      clinical trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at 
      conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12610000650099.

TI  - Stepwise increase in arterial stiffness corresponding with the stages of chronic 
      kidney disease.
PG  - 494-501
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis therapy 
      have a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD). A similar finding is noted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
      important contributors are premature and accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular 
      calcification. We assessed the severity of arterial stiffness in 102 patients with 
      CKD by using pulse wave velocity (PWV) and sought to identify associated risk 
      factors. METHODS: PWV was measured by calculating the distance traveled by the flow 
      wave and divided by the time delay. Correlations between PWV and traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per 1.73 m2 
      , blood pressure (BP), and pulse pressure (PP) were analyzed. RESULTS: PWV values in 
      patients with CKD stages 1 to 2 and the age-matched control group were similar. 
      There was a significant trend for a stepwise increase in PWV corresponding to 
      advance in CKD stage (P < 0.0001). Univariate linear regression analysis showed that 
      age, prior CVD, diabetes, hypertension, any high risk, estimated GFR per 1.73 m2 , 
      systolic BP, and PP correlated with PWV. In the multivariate model, decreased 
      estimated GFR per 1.73 m2 and increased systolic BP were independently associated 
      with increased PWV in patients with CKD (model R 2 = 0.539; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: 
      This is the first study to show a greater PWV in patients with more advanced CKD 
      from stages 1 to 5. Estimated GFR per 1.73 m2 and systolic BP were the major 
      clinical determinants of arterial stiffness in patients with CKD independent of 
      conventional risk factors for CVD.

TI  - The effects of rhBMP-2 and Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients 
      with cardiovascular complication after maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 464-72
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000217 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the correlation of regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17 cell 
      function disequilibrium with calcification in uremic patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) with healthy controls, and investigated if their influence 
      possibly increased the development and outcome of cardiovascular complications in 
      uremic patients after MHD. METHODS: The extent of coronary artery calcification was 
      assessed by coronary artery calcification scoring (CACS) in uremic patients with and 
      without adverse cardiovascular events after MHD (MHD group 1 vs. MHD group 2, 
      respectively). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with rhBMP-2 as 
      positive control. The Treg/Th17 cell frequencies, Foxp3 ROR-gt mRNA expressions, and 
      MIP 3α/CCL20 concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The CACS score was significantly 
      higher in MHD group 1 as compared group 2. In comparison with controls, rhBMP-2 
      upregulates Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients, displayed higher 
      Treg and Th17 frequencies, Foxp3 and ROR-gt expressions, and MIP3α/CCL20 
      concentrations. However, the up-regulations of Treg frequencies and Foxp3 
      expressions were significant in controls but not in MHD patients. It was also 
      observed that Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium was not only correlated with 
      rhBMP-2 state but also consistent with the cardiovascular complications. Moreover, 
      the CACS was negatively correlated with Treg cell frequencies but positively 
      correlated with Th17 cell frequencies and MIP3a/CCL20 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Function disequilibrium of Treg/Th17 was related to the degree of the rhBMP-2 state. 
      Function disequilibrium of the Treg/Th17 might act synergistically with rhBMP-2 in 
      the high incidence of immune-mediated cardiovascular complications after MHD.

TI  - Does p-cresylglucuronide have the same impact on mortality as other protein-bound 
      uremic toxins?
PG  - e67168
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067168 [doi]
LID - e67168
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uremic toxins are emerging as important, non-traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors in chronic kidney disease (CKD). P-cresol has been defined as a 
      prototype protein-bound uremic toxin. Conjugation of p-cresol creates 
      p-cresylsulfate (PCS) as the main metabolite and p-cresylglucuronide (PCG), at a 
      markedly lower concentration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate 
      serum PCG levels, determine the latter's association with mortality and establish 
      whether the various protein-bound uremic toxins (i.e. PCS, PCG and indoxylsulfate 
      (IS)) differed in their ability to predict mortality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We studied 139 patients (mean ± SD age: 67±12; males: 60%) at different 
      CKD stages (34.5% at CKD stages 2-3, 33.5% at stage 4-5 and 32% at stage 5D). A 
      recently developed high-performance liquid chromatography method was used to assay 
      PCG concentrations. Total and free PCG levels increased with the severity of CKD. 
      During the study period (mean duration: 779±185 days), 38 patients died. High free 
      and total PCG levels were correlated with overall and cardiovascular mortality 
      independently of well-known predictors of survival, such as age, vascular 
      calcification, anemia, inflammation and (in predialysis patients) the estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate. In the same cohort, free PCS levels and free IS levels 
      were both correlated with mortality. Furthermore, the respective predictive powers 
      of three Cox multivariate models (free PCS+other risk factors, free IS+other risk 
      factors and free PCS+other risk factors) were quite similar--suggesting that an 
      elevated PCG concentration has much the same impact on mortality as other uremic 
      toxins (such as PCS or IS) do. CONCLUSIONS: Although PCG is the minor metabolite of 
      p-cresol, our study is the first to reveal its association with mortality. 
      Furthermore, the free fraction of PCG appears to have much the same predictive power 
      for mortality as PCS and IS do.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy as a Cure for Calciphylaxis in a Non-Dialysis Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Patient?
PG  - 1170-1174
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.917105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a rare and fatal systemic disease which most commonly 
      occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is a poorly understood vascular 
      calcification with unclear pathology that leads to vascular compromise due to 
      vascular occlusion with endoluminal calcification. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 
      61-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who developed calciphylaxis. 
      The patient was diagnosed with dry gangrene of the second and third digits of the 
      right hand and second, third, and fourth phalanges of the left hand. Despite medical 
      therapy and local wound care, the lesions progressively worsened with time. The 
      patient was found to have secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone was 
      1028 pg/mL) and underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy. In our patient, the skin 
      lesions due to calciphylaxis completely resolved over the course of 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS Parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical benefit in patients 
      with calciphylaxis. Clinicians should consider parathyroidectomy in the setting of 
      high parathyroid hormone and calciphylaxis. Although parathyroidectomy is an 
      effective treatment option for calciphylaxis it is not a definitive treatment and 
      calciphylaxis can occur, though rarely, even after parathyroidectomy. There is a 
      need to do further studies in order to confirm the efficacy of parathyroidectomy.

PG  - 315-9
AB  - An objective radiographic study of erosions, fractures, and periarticular and 
      vascular calcification was made in a series of 135 patients over 10 years of 
      maintenance haemodialysis therapy. The four lesions progressed at different rates, 
      consistent with variation in the response of tissues to a changing biochemical 
      milieu and deficiency in vitamin D metabolites. The half time for development of 
      individual radiographic signs was 3.4 years for vascular calcification, 9 years for

      Calcification of the dorsalis pedis artery seen as a developing ring or tube was an 
      early and valuable sign of disturbed calcium metabolism. In these patients renal 
      osteodystrophy is a chronic condition with a prolonged time course.

TI  - Effect of alendronate on vascular calcification in CKD stages 3 and 4: a pilot 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 57-68
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.12.039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular disease in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Few studies have addressed interventions to 
      decrease vascular calcification; however, experimental studies report benefits of 
      bisphosphonates. Recent studies of hemodialysis patients also suggest benefits of 
      bisphosphonates on vascular calcification; however, no study exists in nondialysis 
      patients with CKD. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to 
      determine the effect of bisphosphonates on vascular calcification in patients with 
      CKD. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 51 patients with CKD stages 3-4 were recruited from a 
      hospital outpatient setting; 50 were treated with study medication. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Patients were randomly assigned to either alendronate, 70 mg (n = 25), or matching 
      placebo (n = 25), administered weekly. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was change in 
      aortic vascular calcification after 18 months. Secondary outcomes included 
      superficial femoral artery vascular calcification, arterial compliance, bone mineral 
      density (BMD), renal function, and serum markers of mineral metabolism. 
      MEASUREMENTS: At baseline and 12 and 18 months, computed tomography, pulse wave 
      velocity using SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, PWV Inc, www.atcormedical.com), and 
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were performed to measure vascular calcification, 
      arterial compliance, and BMD, respectively. Analysis was by intention to treat, with 
      a random-effect linear regression model to assess differences. RESULTS: 46 patients 
      completed the study (24 alendronate, 22 placebo); baseline mean age was 63.1 +/- 1.8 
      years, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 34.5 +/- 1.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 59% 
      had diabetes, and 65% were men. 91% had aortic vascular calcification at the start 
      and 78% showed progression. At 18 months, there was no difference in vascular 
      calcification progression with alendronate compared with placebo (adjusted 
      difference, -24.2 Hounsfield units [95% CI, -77.0 to 28.6]; P = 0.4). There was an 
      increase in lumbar spine BMD (T score difference, +0.3 [95% CI, 0.03-0.6]; P = 0.04) 
      and a trend toward better pulse wave velocity (-1 m/s [95% CI, -2.1 to 0.1]; P = 
      0.07) with alendronate. Femoral BMD was similar between groups. There was a 
      nonsignificant decrease in kidney function in patients on alendronate therapy 
      compared with placebo (-1.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) [95% CI, -4.0 to 1.7]). LIMITATIONS: 
      Small sample size and baseline differences, especially with aortic vascular 
      calcification, may have diminished any potential difference between groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous studies of hemodialysis patients, alendronate did not 
      decrease the progression of vascular calcification compared with placebo in patients 
      with CKD during 18 months.

PG  - 1447-1460
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10791016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D is implicated in vascular health in CKD. This 
      study compared placebo, calcifediol, and calcitriol treatment with changes in 
      vascular stiffness, BP, proteinuria, mineral metabolism parameters, C-reactive 
      protein, and fibroblast growth factor 23 in patients with stable CKD. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized 
      controlled trial in out-patient CKD clinics in Vancouver, Canada, from February of 
      2011 to August of 2014, enrolling 119 patients with an eGFR of 15-45 ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2). Change in pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured after 6 months of treatment 
      with a fixed dose of oral calcifediol (5000 IU 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)), calcitriol 
      (0.5 µg 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)), or placebo, thrice weekly. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-seven participants were evaluated. Mean age was 66 years, 71% were men, 40% 
      were diabetic, and mean baseline PWV was 11.5 m/s (SD=3.9 m/s). After 6 months, the 
      PWV decreased in the calcifediol group (mean change, -1.1; 95% confidence interval 
      [95% CI], -2.2 to 0.1 m/s), remained unchanged in the calcitriol group (mean change, 
      0.2; 95% CI, -0.9 to 1.4 m/s), and increased in the placebo group (mean change, 1.1; 
      95% CI, -0.1 to 2.2 m/s). The overall P value for between-arm changes was 0.03. 
      Absolute PWV change was significantly different between groups (P=0.04): the 
      combined vitamin D treatment group saw decreased PWV (mean change, -0.4; 95% CI, 
      -1.2 to 0.4 m/s) whereas the placebo group saw increased PWV (mean change, +1.1; 95% 
      CI, -0.1 to 2.2 m/s). The treatment group demonstrated significantly decreased serum 
      parathyroid hormone (mean difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.3 ln[pg/ml]; P<0.001) 
      and increased calcium (mean difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.7 mg/dl; P=0.02). In 
      observational analysis, participants in the highest 25-hydroxyvitamin D tertile at 
      trial end had significant decreases in PWV (mean change, -1.0; 95% CI, -2.0 to 0.0 
      m/s) compared with the middle and lowest tertiles (P<0.01). Side effects were minor 
      and rare. CONCLUSIONS: Six months of supplemental vitamin D analogs at fixed doses 
      may achieve a reduction of PWV in patients with advanced CKD. Because the treatment 
      effect was attenuated when baseline PWV was included as a covariate, these findings 
      should be replicated in larger populations and further studied.

TI  - Effects of lanthanum carbonate on bone markers and bone mineral density in incident 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1075-1082
LID - 10.1007/s00774-019-01018-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent clinical studies demonstrated the favorable effects of 
      calcium-free phosphate binders on mortality and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
      effects of a calcium-free phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate (LC), on bone 
      metabolic markers and bone mineral density (BMD), compared with those of calcium 
      carbonate (CC), in subjects new to HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study 
      included 65 subjects from our previous randomized controlled trial (LC group, 
      N = 31; CC group, N = 34). We investigated the effects of LC on serum intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
      (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b), sclerostin levels, and 
      BMD, compared with those of CC in patients new to HD at baseline and at 12 and 
      18 months. RESULTS: Serum OC levels at 18 months were significantly higher in the LC 
      group than in the CC group. During the study period, serum BAP and TRACP-5b and iPTH 
      levels tended to be higher in the LC group than in the CC group. At 18 months, the 
      percentage of low bone turnover, based on a serum BAP cutoff value, was 
      significantly lower in the LC group than in the CC group. There were no significant 
      differences in the lumbar and femoral BMD between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results of the present study suggest that LC has potential in preventing low bone 
      turnover, in comparison to CC, in patients new to HD.

TI  - Vitamin k intake and plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein levels in 
      kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - e47991
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047991 [doi]
LID - e47991
AB  - Vitamin K is essential for activation of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins including 
      the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla-protein (MGP). Insufficient vitamin 
      K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly inactive proteins and 
      contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney transplant recipients, 
      cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K intake and status have not been defined. 
      We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular vitamin K status and its 
      determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We estimated vitamin K intake in a 
      cohort of kidney transplant recipients (n = 60) with stable renal function 
      (creatinine clearance 61 [42-77] (median [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 
      [35-188] months after transplantation, using three-day food records and food 
      frequency questionnaires. Vascular vitamin K status was assessed by measuring plasma 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below the 
      recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with 
      less consumption of green vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased dp-ucMGP 
      levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p<0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP levels were elevated (>500 
      pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified creatinine clearance, 
      coumarin use, body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and sodium excretion as 
      independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a considerable part of the kidney 
      transplant population, vitamin K intake is too low for maximal carboxylation of 
      vascular MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may result in an increased risk for arterial 
      calcification. Whether increasing vitamin K intake may have health benefits for 
      kidney transplant recipients should be addressed by future studies.

TI  - CDKN2A/p16INK4(a) expression is associated with vascular progeria in chronic kidney 
      disease.

LID - 10.18632/aging.101173 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) display a progeric vascular phenotype 
      linked to apoptosis, cellular senescence and osteogenic transformation. This has 
      proven intractable to modelling appropriately in model organisms. We have therefore 
      investigated this directly in man, using for the first time validated cellular 
      biomarkers of ageing (CDKN2A/p16(INK4a), SA-β-Gal) in arterial biopsies from 61 CKD 
      patients undergoing living donor renal transplantation. We demonstrate that in the 
      uremic milieu, increased arterial expression of CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) associated with 
      vascular progeria in CKD, independently of chronological age. The arterial 
      expression of CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) was significantly higher in patients with coronary 
      calcification (p=0.01) and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) (p=0.004). The 
      correlation between CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) and media calcification was statistically 
      significant (p=0.0003) after correction for chronological age. We further employed 
      correlate expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP) and runt-related transcription 
      factor 2 (RUNX2) as additional pathognomonic markers. Higher expression of 
      CDKN2A/p16(INK4a), RUNX2 and MGP were observed in arteries with severe media 
      calcification. The number of p16(INK4a) and SA-β-Gal positive cells was higher in 
      biopsies with severe media calcification. A strong inverse correlation was observed 
      between CDKN2A/p16(INK4a) expression and carboxylated osteocalcin levels. Thus, 
      impaired vitamin K mediated carboxylation may contribute to premature vascular 
      senescence.

LID - 10.1159/000353569 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), and contributed to by the CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). CKD-MBD begins 
      in early CKD and its vascular manifestations begin with vascular stiffness 
      proceeding to increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) and vascular 
      calcification (VC). Phosphorus is associated with this progression and is considered 
      a CVD risk factor in CKD. We hypothesized that modifying phosphorus balance with 
      lanthanum carbonate (LaCO3) in early CKD would not produce hypophosphatemia and may 
      affect vascular manifestations of CKD-MBD. METHODS: We randomized 38 subjects with 
      normophosphatemic stage 3 CKD to a fixed dose of LaCO3 or matching placebo without 
      adjusting dietary phosphorus in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, pilot and 
      feasibility study. The primary outcome was the change in serum phosphorus. Secondary 
      outcomes were changes in measures of phosphate homeostasis and vascular stiffness 
      assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), cIMT and VC over 12 months. 
      RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between LaCO3 and 
      placebo with respect to the change in serum phosphorus, urinary phosphorus, tubular 
      reabsorption of phosphorus, PWV, cIMT, or VC. Biomarkers of the early CKD-MBD such 
      as plasma fibroblast growth factor-23, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and 
      sclerostin were increased 2- to 3-fold at baseline, but were not affected by LaCO3. 
      CONCLUSION: Twelve months of LaCO3 had no effect on serum phosphorus and did not 
      alter phosphate homeostasis, PWV, cIMT, VC, or biomarkers of CKD-MBD.

TI  - Long-term clinical outcome of rotational atherectomy followed by drug-eluting stent 
      implantation in complex calcified coronary lesions.
PG  - 285-91
LID - 10.1002/ccd.24367 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term outcome after rotational atherectomy (RA) is 
      followed by drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in complex calcified coronary 
      lesions. BACKGROUND: RA can favorably modify heavily calcified coronary lesions, but 
      long-term outcome is poor when it is used as a stand-alone therapy or combined with 
      bare-metal stents. DES have reduced rates of restenosis in a wide range of patient 
      and lesion subsets, but little information is available on long-term clinical 
      outcome when RA is followed by DES implantation (Rota-DES) in complex calcified 
      lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients with de novo complex 
      calcified coronary lesions treated with Rota-DES were analyzed. Mean age was 69.7 ± 
      9.3 years, 63 patients (31%) had diabetes mellitus and 21 patients (10%) had chronic 
      renal failure. Total stent length/patient was 32 mm. The majority of patients were 
      treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents (64%) or sirolimus-eluting stents (30%). 
      Angiographic success rate was 98%. The incidence of in-hospital major adverse 
      cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target 
      vessel revascularization (TVR), was 4.4%. Long-term follow-up was available for 188 
      patients (92%). At a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1-84), the 
      cumulative incidence of MACE (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 17.7%. Death occurred in 
      4.4%, MI in 3.4%, TVR in 9.9%, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) in 6.8%. 
      One definite (0.5%) and one probable (0.5%) stent thrombosis were observed. In a 
      multivariate analysis, low ejection fraction (<40%) was the only independent 
      predictor of MACE, and both age and diabetes were independent predictors of TLR. 
      CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest European data set of patients treated 
      with RA in the DES era. RA followed by DES implantation in calcified coronary 
      lesions appears to be feasible and effective, with a high rate of procedural success 
      and low incidence of TLR and MACE at long term considering this complex patient and 
      lesion subset.

TI  - Decrease in thoracic vertebral bone attenuation with calcium-based phosphate binders 
      in hemodialysis.
PG  - 764-72
AB  - We performed a post hoc analysis of a 52-week randomized trial conducted in adult 
      hemodialysis patients that compared the effects of calcium-based phosphate binders 
      and sevelamer, a nonabsorbable polymer, on parameters of mineral metabolism and 
      vascular calcification by electron beam tomography. In this analysis, we evaluated 
      the relative effects of calcium and sevelamer on thoracic vertebral attenuation by 
      CT and markers of bone turnover. Subjects randomized to calcium salts experienced a 
      significant reduction in trabecular bone attenuation and a trend toward reduction in 
      cortical bone attenuation, in association with higher concentrations of serum 
      calcium, lower concentrations of PTH, and reduced total and bone-specific alkaline 
      phosphatase. INTRODUCTION: In patients with chronic kidney disease, 
      hyperphosphatemia is associated with osteodystrophy, vascular and soft tissue 
      calcification, and mortality. Calcium-based phosphate binders are commonly 
      prescribed to reduce intestinal phosphate absorption and to attenuate secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism. Clinicians and investigators have presumed that, in 
      hemodialysis patients, calcium exerts beneficial effects on bone. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of a 52-week randomized trial conducted in 
      adult hemodialysis patients that compared the effects of calcium-based phosphate 
      binders and sevelamer, a nonabsorbable polymer, on parameters of mineral metabolism 
      and vascular calcification by electron beam tomography. In this analysis, we 
      evaluated the relative effects of calcium and sevelamer on thoracic vertebral 
      attenuation by CT and markers of bone turnover. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The average 
      serum phosphorus and calcium x phosphorus products were similar for both groups, 
      although the average serum calcium concentration was significantly higher in the 
      calcium-treated group. Compared with sevelamer-treated subjects, calcium-treated 
      subjects showed a decrease in thoracic vertebral trabecular bone attenuation (p = 
      0.01) and a trend toward decreased cortical bone attenuation. More than 30% of 
      calcium-treated subjects experienced a 10% or more decrease in trabecular and 
      cortical bone attenuation. On study, sevelamer-treated subjects had higher 
      concentrations of total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and PTH 
      (p < 0.001). When used to correct hyperphosphatemia, calcium salts lead to a 
      reduction in thoracic trabecular and cortical bone attenuation. Calcium salts may 
      paradoxically decrease BMD in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on 
      vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels 
      between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the 
      relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, 
      and the mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred 
      forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 
      [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels 
      of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) 
      had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean 
      follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments 
      (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, 
      hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and 
      insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected 
      mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D 
      may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be 
      further explored.

AB  - A variety of criteria exist for histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis, also 
      known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy but data on their specificity are limited. 
      To assess this, histologic findings of 38 skin biopsies performed for a suspicion of 
      calcific uremic arteriolopathy were compared with histologic findings in skin 
      obtained from healthy margins of 43 amputations in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD) without evidence of calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Abnormalities in 
      small arteries or arterioles were present in 35% of amputation specimens and 55% of 
      skin biopsies, and among these only thrombosis but not calcification was 
      significantly more prevalent in skin biopsies. The prevalence of extravascular 
      calcification did not differ. Vascular lesions were more common in skin biopsies 
      from patients with high clinical suspicion of calcific uremic arteriolopathy (81%), 
      significantly driven by increases in both calcification and thrombosis, compared to 
      amputations (35%). The combination of medial calcification and thrombosis was 
      six-fold more prevalent in high-suspicion skin biopsies than in amputation 
      specimens. The location of affected vessels did not differ. In two autopsy cases, 
      some but not all findings of involved skin were also present in uninvolved skin. 
      Thus, histopathologic findings historically associated with calcific uremic 
      arteriolopathy can also occur in viable tissue from unaffected patients with ESRD, 
      calling into question the specificity of individual histologic findings for calcific 
      uremic arteriolopathy. However, the combination of medial calcification and 
      thrombosis was rare in unaffected patients and may provide a higher degree of 
      specificity.

TI  - [A case of isolated small intestinal wall calcification on patient with continuous 
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis].
PG  - 55-8
AB  - The metastatic calcification is defined as the deposition of calcium salt in normal 
      tissue with an abnormal serum biochemical environment, such as chronic kidney 
      disease, hyperparathyroidism, and hypercalcemia related with malignancy. Although 
      the metastatic calcification can develop in any organs and tissues, presenting its 
      symptoms and complications are rare. Thus a few cases have been reported. This case 
      shows the metastatic calcification of the small intestine without any peritoneal and 
      mesenteric vascular calcification which was early diagnosed by computed tomography 
      and mesenteric angiography in a patient with abdominal pain, receiving continuous 
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis due to end stage renal disease. The clinician should 
      early consider the metastatic calcification as differential diagnosis when 
      unidentified calcifications are noted in simple abdominal X-ray such as in the 
      present case, and promptly confirm it by using appropriate diagnostic tests in order 
      to prevent its complications and progression.

TI  - Vascular calcification and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in non-dialysis patients with 
      chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5.
PG  - 2250-6
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in this 
      population and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Vascular 
      calcification in uraemic patients is known to be an active and regulated process 
      subject to the action of many promoting and inhibitory factors. The role of vitamin 
      D in this process remains controversial. We evaluated the relationship between serum 
      levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and vascular calcification evaluated by 
      plain X-ray images, in predialysis patients with CKD stages 4 and 5. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study with 210 CKD patients stages 4 and 5 managed at 
      our predialysis unit. Patients were 63.5 ± 13 years of age, 60.5% males, 64.8% 
      diabetics and 47.1% with a history of CVD. Plain X-ray images of pelvis, hands and 
      lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were studied for calculation of 
      semiquantitative vascular calcification scores as described by Adragao and Kauppila. 
      RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of vascular calcification in our population. 
      Adragao scores revealed only 47 patients (22.4%) without vascular calcification and 
      120 (57.1%) with scores higher than 3. Kauppila scores revealed only 29 patients 
      (13.8%) without aortic calcifications and 114 patients (54.3%) with scores higher 
      than 7. Higher vascular calcification scores were related to older age, diabetes, 
      history of CVD and lower levels of 25(OH)D. Only 18.5% of patients had adequate 
      levels of 25(OH)D (> 30 ng/mL), 53.7% of them had insufficient levels (15-30 ng/mL) 
      and 27.8% had deficient levels (< 15 ng/mL). Multivariate analysis showed that age, 
      diabetes and CVD were directly associated and 25(OH)D levels were inversely 
      associated with vascular calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show an 
      independent and negative association between serum levels of 25(OH)D and vascular 
      calcification. Further and larger prospective studies are needed to clarify the 
      possible role of vitamin D deficiency in the development of vascular calcification 
      in CKD patients.

TI  - Effect of renal transplantation on coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 2829-31
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.07.037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. Coronary artery calcification is more frequent, more extensive, 
      and progresses more rapidly among subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in 
      the general population. It is also considered to be a marker of coronary heart 
      disease, the main cause of increased morbidity and mortality among patients either 
      on maintenance hemodialysis or after transplantation. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the effect of renal transplantation on the calcium scores of coronary 
      arteries among hemodialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 31 
      patients (17 males and 14 females) of age range 19 to 56 years (mean, 38.08 +/- 
      13.49 years) who had been hemodialyzed 3 times a week for 6 to 49 months (mean, 20 
      +/- 15.72 months) prior to renal transplantation. Homocysteine, intact parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH), calcium, phosphate, and indices of lipid metabolism such as total 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 
      triglycerides were measured before and at 6 months after transplantation. To 
      evaluate coronary artery calcification, all patients underwent multidetector 
      coronary computed tomography (MDCT) using the Agatston technique for calcium scoring 
      (CS) and color Doppler ultrasound for IMT before and at 6 months after the 
      procedure. RESULTS: The prevalence of coronary artery calcifications among dialysis 
      patients was 96% with a total CS ranging from 0 to 198. It affected more than 2 
      vessels in >50% of subjects with higher calcium scores in the left anterior 
      descending artery (LAD). Mean total CS decreased significantly from pre- (39.82 +/- 
      63.05) to postoperation (24.34 +/- 39.55; P < .001). CS decreased from pre- to 
      postprocedure in the left main artery (7.4 +/- 13.03 to 4.3 +/- 8.54; P < .01) and 
      in LAD (15.76 +/- 23.53 to 10.23 +/- 15.81; P < .01 and in the circumflex (7.8 +/- 
      14.98 to 5.1 +/- 9.57; P < .001) and in the right coronary artery (9.2 +/- 17.18 to 
      4.7 +/- 8.18; P < .01). The CS before the procedure correlated significantly with 
      age (r = .39; P < .005), P (r = .33; P < .05), Ca x P product (r = .39; P < .05), 
      iPTH (r = .43; P < .001), and IMT (r = .56; P < .0001). There was a linear, 
      meaningful correlation between CS and iPTH and Ca x P product reduction after renal 
      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplantation significantly reduced coronary 
      artery calcification among dialysis patients. It linearly correlated with a decrease 
      in iPTH and Ca x P product at an early period after renal transplantation.

TI  - Low fetuin-A levels are associated with cardiovascular death: Impact of variations 
      in the gene encoding fetuin.
PG  - 2383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
      observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory 
      glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation 
      and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association 
      between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin 
      gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome. METHODS: In a cohort 
      of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement therapy [glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years the following 
      parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), 
      comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], 
      carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid 
      positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser (C-->G), Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys 
      (C-->T). RESULTS: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) 
      mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking, 
      diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 
      0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had 
      significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD 
      patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N= 101), fetuin-A was 
      significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques 
      independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and inflammation. 
      Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both S-albumin (Rho = 
      0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser 
      allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortality rate if they were inflamed. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that a low 
      fetuin-A level is associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis 
      (carotid plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
      Because the present study demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on 
      both circulating fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with 
      the AHSG 256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.

TI  - Kidney transplantation for patients on long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 2297-8
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.06.019 [doi]
AB  - Patients surviving more than 10 years on hemodialysis (HD) are at risk of developing 
      serious morbidity from unrelated conditions and from the many complications of 
      long-term dialysis, such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
      malignant tumors ectopic vascular calcification, diabetes mellitus, and disuse 
      atrophy of the bladder. Long-term dialysis affects transplant patient outcomes and 
      long-term graft survival. We analyzed 436 patients who underwent kidney 
      transplantations between January 1987 and December 2007 to determine the impact of 
      long-term dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes. The 39 patients who had been 
      treated pretransplantation with dialysis for more than 10 years had an average 
      length of dialysis treatment of 15.8 years (range, 10.0-32.5 years); they were 
      denoted as the long-term hemodialysis group. The remaining 397 recipients showed an 
      average of 3.7 years period of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (range, 0-9.8, years; 
      short-term hemodialysis group). There were significant differences in patient 
      survival rates between the 2 groups: 93.2% vs 98.6%, at 1 year; 79.3% vs 95.4% at 5 
      years; and 58.4% vs 93.1% at 10 years (P = .0034). Also, graft survival was 
      significantly different between the 2 groups: 89.2% vs 95.8% at 1 year; 60.4% vs 
      88.5% at 5 years; and 33.4% vs 80.4% at 10 years (P = .0026). Our results suggest 
      that dialysis treatment for more than 10 years produces negative effects on 
      post-transplantation patient and graft survival.

TI  - The axis of local cardiac endogenous Klotho-TGF-β1-Wnt signaling mediates cardiac 
      fibrosis in human.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular fibrosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular 
      disease, the primary cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      We previously reported expression of endogenous Klotho in human arteries, and that 
      CKD is a state of Klotho deficiency, resulting in vascular calcification, but 
      myocardial expression of Klotho is poorly understood. This study aimed to further 
      clarify endogenous Klotho's functional roles in cardiac fibrosis in patients with 
      underlying CKD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human atrial appendage specimens were collected 
      during cardiac surgery from individuals with or without CKD. Cardiac fibrosis was 
      quantified using trichrome staining. For endogenous Klotho functional studies, 
      primary human cardiomyocytes (HCMs) were treated with uremic serum from CKD patients 
      or recombinant human TGF-β1. The effects of endogenous Klotho in HCMs were studied 
      using Klotho-siRNA and Klotho-plasmid transfection. Both gene and protein expression 
      of endogenous Klotho are found in human heart, but decreased Klotho expression is 
      clearly associated with the degree of cardiac fibrosis in CKD patients. Moreover, we 
      show that endogenous Klotho is expressed by HCMs and cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) but 
      that HCM expression is suppressed by uremic serum or TGF-β1. Klotho knockdown or 
      overexpression aggravates or mitigates TGF-β1-induced fibrosis and canonical Wnt 
      signaling in HCMs, respectively. Furthermore, co-culture of HCMs with HCFs increases 
      TGF-β1-induced fibrogenic proteins in HCFs, but overexpression of endogenous Klotho 
      in HCMs mitigates this effect, suggesting functional crosstalk between HCMs and 
      HCFs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data from analysis of human hearts as well as functional in 
      vitro studies strongly suggests that the loss of cardiac endogenous Klotho in CKD 
      patients, specifically in cardiomyocytes, facilitates intensified TGF-β1 signaling 
      which enables more vigorous cardiac fibrosis through upregulated Wnt signaling. 
      Upregulation of endogenous Klotho inhibits pathogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling and 
      may offer a novel strategy for prevention and treatment of cardiac fibrosis in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - The Correlation of Serum Osteoprotegerin with Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk 
      Factors and Arterial Stiffness in Patients with Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: 
      Results from the KNOW-CKD Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays protective roles against the development of 
      vascular calcification (VC) which greatly contributes to the increased 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present 
      study aimed to find the non-traditional, kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors 
      correlated to serum OPG and the effect of serum OPG on the arterial stiffness 
      measured by brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in patients with the 
      pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed the data from the patients 
      in whom baPWV and the serum OPG were measured at the time of enrollment in a 
      prospective pre-dialysis CKD cohort study in Korea. RESULTS: Along with traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, pulse pressure, and 
      baPWV, non-traditional, kidney-related factors such as albuminuria, plasma level of 
      hemoglobin, total CO(2) content, alkaline phosphatase, and corrected calcium were 
      independent variables for serum OPG in multivariate linear regression. Reciprocally, 
      the serum OPG was positively associated with baPWV in multivariate linear 
      regression. The baPWV in the 3rd and 4th quartile groups of serum OPG were higher 
      than that in the 1st quartile group after adjustments by age, sex and other 
      significant factors for baPWV in linear mixed model. CONCLUSION: Non-traditional, 
      kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors in addition to traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors were related to serum level of OPG in CKD. Serum OPG level was 
      significantly related to baPWV. Our study suggests that kidney-related factors 
      involved in CKD-specific pathways for VC play a role in the increased secretion of 
      OPG into circulation in patients with CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT01630486.

TI  - Coronary calcification and cardiac events after percutaneous intervention in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 133-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described increased vascular calcification in 
      renal dialysis patients. The clinical significance of this finding with respect to 
      outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention in this population is unknown. 
      METHODS: We analysed a prospective interventional database at a single tertiary 
      center and identified 41 dialysis patients who underwent coronary angioplasty. All 
      studies were reviewed for the presence of coronary calcium in the target and 
      reference vessels and compared with respect to baseline clinical factors and 
      cardiovascular outcomes. RESULTS: The mean ages for those with and without coronary 
      calcification were 63.6 +/- 11.0 and 67.3 +/- 11.0, respectively, P = 0.30. The 
      groups were similar in years on dialysis, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and 
      measures of calcium and phosphate balance. The total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and 
      triglycerides were 162.5 +/- 42.3 and 202.0 +/- 54.5, P = 0.02; 94.9 +/- 39.6 and 
      121.2 +/- 48.1, P = 0.18; 39.3 +/- 12.4 and 47.3 +/- 12.2, P = 0.15; 157.4 +/- 100.4 
      and 181.3 +/- 187.4, P = 0.15, for those with and without calcification, 
      respectively. The composite of target vessel revascularization, myocardial 
      infarction, or death was 47.4% and 77.3% for those with and without calcification, 
      respectively, P = 0.06. The Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for years on 
      dialysis, showed a significant, event-free survival in those with coronary calcium 
      seen fluoroscopically, P = 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, coronary 
      calcification identified in the target or reference vessels is associated with lower 
      total cholesterol and favourable interventional outcomes.

TI  - Comparison of sevelamer hydrochloride with colestimide, administered alone or in 
      combination with calcium carbonate, in patients on hemodialysis.
PG  - 126-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1744-9987.2008.00557.x [doi]
AB  - Since hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients can cause secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism and promotes vascular calcification, serum phosphate (Pi) levels 
      must be controlled by phosphate binders. Although sevelamer and colestimide are 
      known as similar non-calcium, non-aluminum phosphate binders in hemodialysis 
      patients, there are no studies that compare the effects of the two agents as either 
      a monotherapy or in combination with calcium carbonate (CaCO3). We randomly 
      allocated 62 hemodialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia to treatment with 
      sevelamer (3.0 g/day) and colestimide (3.0 g/day). During the study, 35 subjects 
      dropped out, leaving 13 in the sevelamer group and 14 in the colestimide group. 
      After a 2-week CaCO3 washout, all subjects received the monotherapy for 4 weeks and 
      then CaCO3 (3.0 g/day) was added for another 4 weeks. Serum corrected calcium levels 
      tended to decrease in both groups during the washout period and monotherapy, but 
      there was no significant difference between the two groups after the addition of 
      CaCO3. Although the calcium x phosphorus product (Ca x P) in the two groups 
      increased during the washout period, there was no significant change or difference 
      between the two groups during monotherapy. However, the addition of CaCO3 
      significantly reduced serum Pi at Week 8 compared to that at Week 0 in both groups, 
      and significantly lowered Ca x P only in the sevelamer group, but not in the 
      colestimide group(.) In this short-term study, sevelamer and colestimide similarly 
      ameliorated hyperphosphatemia, but the combination of sevelamer and CaCO3 was more 
      effective than colestimide with CaCO3 in controlling the Ca x P product, and it may 
      improve cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - FGF23 protein expression in coronary arteries is associated with impaired kidney 
      function.
PG  - 1525-32
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft523 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and elevated values have been associated with both heart 
      disease and mortality. Recent studies show that FGF23, a protein synthesized by 
      osteocytes, is also present in calcified atherosclerotic plaques and may be induced 
      by heart disease. Whether vascular expression of FGF23 is associated with 
      progressive CKD, however, remains unknown. Therefore, the relationship between 
      kidney function, vascular calcification and FGF23 expression was evaluated in 
      patients with heart disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for FGF23 was performed 
      in coronary arteries of all patients undergoing heart transplantation at UCLA 
      between February 2008 and 2010. Immunohistochemical staining for Klotho, DMP1, 
      FGFR1, and FGFR3; calcium deposition; and RNA expression of Klotho and DMP1 were 
      assessed in a subset of eight samples. RESULTS: FGF23 was detected by 
      immunohistochemistry in 56% of the coronary artery specimens. Vascular FGF23 
      expression correlated with declining kidney function, as evidenced by reduced 
      creatinine clearance. FGFR1 and FGFR3 were detected throughout the vascular tissue 
      and in calcified plaques. Calcium deposition, Klotho expression and DMP1 expression 
      correlated with FGF23 immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the 
      Klotho-FGF23-FGFR system is active in coronary arteries and its upregulation 
      correlates with impaired renal function and matrix calcium deposition.

TI  - Urine albumin and serum uric acid are important determinants of serum 25 
      hydroxyvitamin D level in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients.

AB  - Low serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH D) is common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. This cross-sectional study is looking for the different factors associated 
      with serum 25 OH D among pre-dialysis CKD. 1624 adult stage 3-5 CKD patients were 
      studied beside 200 normal control subjects. All candidates were tested for body mass 
      index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), parathormone (PTH), 25 OH D, albumin, and uric acid (UA), and urine 
      albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Multivariate linear regression analysis was done to 
      determine predictors of 25 OH D. 98.6% of CKD patients have inadequate level of 25 
      OH D vs 48% of normal subjects. Serum 25 OH D was significantly lower in CKD 
      patients (mean ± S.D = 16.54 ± 5.8 vs 37.79 ± 3.58 ng/mL for CKD vs control group 
      respectively, p < .001). Serum level of 25 OH D has significant positive correlation 
      with Ca (r = 0.337, p < .001), and significant negative correlation with P, PTH, UA, 
      and ACR (r = -0.440, -0. 679, -0.724, and -0.781respectively, p < .001 in all). The 
      independent predictors of 25 OH D were Ca, P, UA, PTH, and ACR (R square = 0.7, 
      β = -0.087, -0.226, -0.313, -0.253, and -0.33 respectively, p < .001 in all). In 
      conclusion, pre-dialysis CKD patients frequently suffer low 25 OH D. Among the 
      different abnormalities related to CKD, urine albumin excretion rate and UA are the 
      most important predictors of 25 OH D in these patients.

AB  - It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are 
      simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone 
      health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney 
      disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of 
      microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery 
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture of 
      the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography 
      (HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar 
      spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery calcification using 
      multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured in 66 patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of bone turnover, vitamin D 
      status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were assessed. CAC score was found to 
      be <100 in 39% and ≥100 in 61% of patients. The median [95% CI] total CAC score was 
      282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis, significant correlations between CAC and age 
      (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3, p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, 
      p<0.01) were found, and parameters of bone microarchitecture were numerically but 
      not significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100. In multivariate analysis 
      stratifying for gender and correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone 
      volume/total volume (BV/TV) were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores 
      ≥100 (p<0.05 for both). Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone 
      density are associated with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.

TI  - Multimodality vascular imaging in CKD: divergence of risk between measured 
      parameters.
PG  - 1004-12
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients 
      appears only partly attributable to atherosclerosis, with much of the remaining risk 
      being ascribed to other vasculature abnormalities, including endothelial 
      dysfunction, arterial stiffness and vascular calcification (VC). To date, these 
      factors have been primarily studied in isolation or in dialysis patients. This study 
      performed a global vascular assessment in moderate CKD and assessed the 
      relationships with both traditional and novel risk factors. METHODS: This was a 
      prospective cross-sectional analysis of 120 patients (age 60 ± 10 years; estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 25-60 mL/min/1.73m(2)). Demographic, clinical and 
      biochemical characterization was performed. VC was characterized by lateral lumbar 
      radiograph; arterial stiffness by aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV); atheroma burden 
      by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and endothelial function by flow-mediated 
      dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. RESULTS: VC was highly prevalent (74%), and 
      FMD generally poor (FMDΔ 3.3 ± 3.3%). There were significant correlations between 
      all vascular parameters; although these were predominantly explained by age. cIMT 
      was independently associated with classical risks and also PWV (adjusted 
      standardized β = 0.31, P = 0.001). However, traditional risks showed almost no 
      independent associations with other vascular measurements. In contrast, serum 
      phosphate and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OHD) correlated with PWV and the 
      presence of VC, respectively. After adjustment, every 1 pg/mL increase in 1,25-OHD 
      was related to a 3% reduction in the chance of VC (odds ratio 0.97; 95% confidence 
      interval 0.94-1.00, P = 0.03). Medication use, HOMA-IR and C-reactive protein did 
      not correlate with any of the vascular measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates extensive vascular disease across multimodality imaging in moderate 
      CKD. Atherosclerotic burden correlated with traditional risks and PWV, while higher 
      1,25-OHD was associated with less VC. The lack of association between renal function 
      and imaging indices raises the possibility of a threshold, rather than graded 
      uraemic effect on vascular health that warrants further exploration.

TI  - Free p-cresylsulphate is a predictor of mortality in patients at different stages of 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1183-91
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uraemic toxins are considered to be emerging mortality risk factors in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. p-Cresol (a prototype protein-bound uraemic 
      retention solute) has been shown to exert toxic effects in vitro. Recently, it has 
      been demonstrated that p-cresol is present in plasma as its sulphate conjugate, 
      p-cresylsulphate. The present study evaluated the distribution of free and total 
      p-cresylsulphate and sought to determine whether these parameters were associated 
      with vascular calcification, arterial stiffness and mortality risk in a cohort of 
      CKD patients. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 
      12; males: 60%) at different stages of CKD (8% at Stage 2, 26.5% at Stage 3, 26.5% 
      at Stage 4, 7% at Stage 5 and 32% at Stage 5D) were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: 
      Baseline total and free p-cresylsulphate presented an inverse relationship with 
      renal function and were significantly associated with vascular calcification. During 
      the study period (mean follow-up period: 779 +/- 185 days), 38 patients died 
      [including 22 from cardiovascular (CV) causes]. In crude survival analyses, free 
      (but not total) p-cresylsulphate was shown to be a predictor of overall and CV 
      death. Higher free p-cresylsulphate levels (>0.051 mg/100 mL; median) were 
      associated with mortality independently of well-known predictors of survival such as 
      age, vascular calcification, anaemia and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of 
      free and total p-cresylsulphate (the main in vivo circulating metabolites of 
      p-cresol) were elevated in later CKD stages. However, only free p-cresylsulphate 
      seems to be a predictor of survival in CKD.

PG  - 431-2
AB  - To date, only 10 cases of distal penile gangrene in patients with chronic renal 
      failure have been reported. This rare condition is believed to result from 
      progressive vascular calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients 
      with chronic renal failure. We report an additional case of distal penile gangrene 
      in a 41-year-old man who presented with chronic renal disease and pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. Since some authors have emphasized that aggressive surgical treatment 
      in such cases has a significant mortality rate, we took a more conservative approach 
      to treatment.

      intestinal calcium absorption suggests that CKD per se is a state of sustained 
      positive calcium balance, a mechanism likely to contribute to vascular calcification 
      and CVD in CKD. However, the determinants of UCE reduction in CKD are not well 
      understood and there is a lack of clinical studies, particularly in the CKD 
      population. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate variables associated with 
      UCE in a CKD cohort. METHODS: Baseline data on 356 participants of the Progredir 
      Study, Sao Paulo, Brazil, essentially composed of CKD G3a-G4, were analyzed 
      according to UCE (24 h urine collection). RESULTS: Median 24 h UCE was 38 mg/day 
      (IQR 21-68 mg/day) and 0.48 mg/kg/day (IQR 0.28-0.82 mg/kg/day). In univariate 
      analysis, UCE was inversely related to age, phosphorus, 1-84 PTH, FGF-23 and 
      sclerostin, and positively associated with eGFR, DBP, 1,25(OH)(2-)vitamin D, 
      calcium, bicarbonate, total calorie intake and spironolactone use. After adjustments 
      for age, sex and eGFR, only 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, FGF-23, bicarbonate and 
      total calorie intake remained associated with it, but not PTH nor sclerostin. 
      Lastly, in a multivariable model, eGFR, serum 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, and 
      FGF-23 remained associated with UCE. Similar results were observed when calcium 
      fractional excretion was used instead of UCE, with eGFR, 1-25-vitamin D and FGF-23 
      remaining as independent associations. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CKD is 
      associated with very low levels of UCE and that 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, serum calcium 
      and FGF-23 were independently associated with UCE in this population, raising the 
      question whether these factors are modulators of the tubular handling of calcium in 
      CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) negatively correlates with serum 
      phosphorus level of stage 3a-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. So far, no 
      explanation has been provided for this negative association. OBJECTIVE: To confirm 
      this negative association and determine if this relationship is mediated through 
      other known co-morbid factors. CASES AND METHODS: One hundred (57 male and 43 
      female) pre-dialysis stage 3a-5 CKD patients were selected. Estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25(OH)D, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH), and intact fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) were assessed. A 
      correlation analysis between serum 25(OH)D and the different parameters studied was 
      performed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried out to determine 
      predictors of 25(OH)D. RESULTS: The negative association between serum 25(OH)D and 
      serum P was confirmed in univariate and multivariate correlation analysis. On the 
      other hand, we failed to detect a significant association between 25(OH)D and serum 
      FGF23. Serum P is the most important independent predictor of 25(OH)D in these 
      patients (partial R(2)=0.15, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Serum P is likely to have a 
      direct negative impact on serum 25(OH)D. Further studies are needed to determine the 
      underlying mechanism.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 is a strong predictor of insulin resistance among 
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 226-230

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is very common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism (MBD) seems to play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is evolving 
      as the most important link between MBD and many pathologic sequences of CKD. The aim 
      was to evaluate IR in pre-dialysis CKD patients looking for a possible association 
      to mineral metabolism among CKD patients. A total of 100 stage 3-5 CKD patients were 
      selected beside 20 normal control subjects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess IR in selected cases. Both groups were 
      compared for fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FBI), HOMA-IR, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25 
      hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH vit D), parathormone (PTH), and uric acid (UA). Correlation 
      study between HOMA_IR and different studied parameters was performed. HOMA-IR is 
      significantly higher in CKD (8.87 ± 3.48 vs. 3.97 ± 0.34 in CKD vs. control, 
      respectively, p < .001). In addition CKD patients have significantly higher FGF23 
      (235 ± 22.96 vs. 139 ± 12.3 pg/mL, p < .001), PTH (76.9 ± 15.27 vs. 
      47.9 ± 2.52 pg/mL, p < .001), P (4.3 ± 0.67 vs. 3.6 ± 0.23 mg/dL, p < .001), and UA 
      (5 ± 1.22 vs. 4.85 ± 0.48 mg/dL, p < .001) and significantly lower Ca (8.2 ± 0.3 vs. 
      8.9 ± 0.33 mg/dL, p < .001), and 25 (OH) vit D (17 ± 5.63 vs. 37 ± 3.43 ng/mL, 
      p < .001). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that BMI, GFR, Ca, P, and 
      FGF23 were the only significant predictors of HOMA IR. Increased IR in CKD is a 
      consequence of the uremic status and is intimately associated with disturbed 
      phosphate metabolism and FGF23. Further studies are needed to look for an underlying 
      mechanism.

TI  - [Calciphylaxis in chronic renal failure: 3 cases].
PG  - 261-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a small vessel disease responsible for vascular 
      calcification and skin necrosis. It occurs in association with chronic renal failure 
      and has a poor prognosis. BUT: Report new cases. We report 3 cases of calciphylaxis 
      occurred in patients with chronic renal failure secondary to interstitial nephritis 
      in 1 case, diabetic nephropathy in 1 case and thrombotic microangiopathy in 1 case. 
      CASES: They were 2 females an 1 man aged of 44, 3 years meanly. Hyperphosphoremia 
      and hyperparathyroidism were the essential risk factors. All patients died by 
      sepsis. This course was precipitating by corticotherapy in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: 
      Early recognition and treatment of risk factors is mandatory to reduce mortality in 
      uremic patients with calciphylaxis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Declining kidney function leads to progressively dysregulated mineral 
      homeostasis and contributes to vascular calcification and a pro-inflammatory milieu, 
      both of which play a critical role in loss of dialysis vascular access patency. We 
      designed this study to examine the relationship between markers of bone and mineral 
      metabolism, vitamin D replacement medications, and vascular access outcomes. We 
      hypothesized that higher levels of calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
      and albumin are independently associated with vascular access patency and that 
      vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower risk of access failure. 
      METHODOLOGY: We abstracted data on 204 consecutive patients referred for 
      angiographic evaluation of their permanent arteriovenous access over a 25-month 
      period. We followed patients from the time of access salvage until subsequent 
      referral for access failure. RESULTS: The incidence of vascular access failure did 
      not differ by serum phosphorus, PTH, calcium, calcium-phosphorus product or albumin 
      level. Patients receiving any vitamin D replacement therapy, however, had a lower 
      incidence of access failure compared to those receiving no therapy. Those receiving 
      vitamin D3 therapy with or without paricalcitol (Zemplar, Abbot Laboratories, Abbot 
      Park, IL) or calcitriol had an adjusted HR = 0.18 compared to those receiving no 
      vitamin D therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a relationship between vitamin 
      D3 usage and better vascular access patency, independent of the effect of vitamin D 
      on PTH. Though this relationship needs more rigorous investigation prior to clinical 
      application, the known differences in the pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of 
      various vitamin D metabolites provide a potential mechanism for these clinical 
      observations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution 
      to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4. 
      METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were 
      studied in 178 patients. RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated 
      positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and 
      also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). 
      Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with 
      reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients 
      with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in 
      patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic 
      response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis 
      confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with 
      AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the 
      chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI 
      remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly 
      increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 
      associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

      disease.
PG  - F1302-11

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the present 
      study, we investigated the potential involvement of endothelial microparticles (MPs) 
      and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the generation of VC in CKD patients. The 
      number of circulating EMPs is greater in patients with VC than without VC (307 ± 167 
      vs. 99 ± 75 EMPs/μl, P < 0.001). The percentage of EPCs is significantly lower in 
      patient with VC than in patients without VC (0.14 ± 0.11% vs. 0.25 ± 0.18%, P = 
      0.002). The number of EPCs expressing osteocalcin (OCN) was higher in VC patients 
      (349 ± 63 cells/100,000) than in non-VC patients (139 ± 75 cells/100,000, P < 0.01). 
      In vitro, MPs obtained from CKD patients were able to induce OCN expression in EPCs 
      from healthy donors; the increase in OCN expression was more accentuated if MPs were 
      obtained from CKD patients with VC. MPs from CKD patients also induced OCN 
      expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. In CKD patients, the 
      rise in endothelial MPs associated with a decrease in the number of EPCs, suggesting 
      an imbalance in the processes of endothelial damage and repair in CKD patients, 
      mainly those with VC. Our results suggest that EPCs, through OCN expression, may 
      directly participate in the process of VC.

TI  - Low versus high dialysate calcium concentration in alternate night nocturnal 
      hemodialysis: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 19-28
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12452 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal 
      hemodialysis (NHD) (≥6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what the 
      optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We aimed 
      to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC) dialysate on 
      cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population. METHODS: A randomized 
      controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or HC 
      dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change in mineral 
      metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular calcification 
      (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral arteries (SFA)), pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left ventricular mass index 
      (LVMI) over 12 months. FINDINGS: In the LC group, pre-dialysis ionised calcium 
      decreased -0.12 mmol/L (-0.18-0.06, P = 0.0001) and PTH increased 16 pmol/L 
      (3.5-28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no significant change in the HC 
      group. In both groups, there was no progression of VC in AA or SFA and no change in 
      PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics were prescribed in a higher percentage 
      in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) with a lower proportion of the HC group 
      being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs. 72%). DISCUSSION: Although dialysate calcium 
      prescription influenced biochemical parameters it was not associated with difference 
      in progression of VC between HC and LC groups. An important finding was the 
      potential impact of alternate night NHD in attenuating progression of VC and 
      inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.

TI  - Pulse wave velocity and vascular calcification at different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 163-9
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e328331b81e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased arterial stiffness and vascular calcification have been 
      recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease. METHOD: In order to examine the precise temporal link 
      between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular risk at the earliest stages of chronic 
      kidney disease, we studied a cohort of 150 patients with chronic kidney disease (52 
      stage 2/3 patients, 51 stage 4/5 patients and 47 stage 5D patients). Each patient 
      underwent a plain, lateral lumbar radiograph and an abdominal and thoracic 
      multislice spiral computer tomography scan in order to identify and quantify aortic 
      and coronary calcifications. Pulse wave velocity was used as a measure of arterial 
      stiffness. RESULTS: Regardless of the disease stage, patients with chronic kidney 
      disease had higher adjusted pulse wave velocity than controls with preserved renal 
      function (14.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 m/s, respectively; P < 0.0001). Regarding 
      aortic calcification, there was a gradual but significant rise in later chronic 
      kidney disease stages. A similar trend was found for coronary calcification. In a 
      multivariate analysis only age, mean arterial pressure, diabetes and the aortic 
      calcification score were independent determinants of higher pulse wave velocity. 
      CONCLUSION: We found that both vascular stiffness and vascular calcification appear 
      early in patients with chronic kidney disease, but only vascular calcification 
      worsens as the disease progresses. The increase of vascular stiffness in adult 
      patients with chronic kidney disease seems to be more related to age, systolic blood 
      pressure, diabetes and vascular calcification than to uremic toxicity.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term haemodialysis patients in a single unit: a 
      retrospective analysis.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC), which is described in the elderly and in diabetics, is 
      frequently seen in uraemia. It is usually regarded as having little significance. We 
      studied the roentgenological appearance of VC in a homogeneous group of 38 
      long-hours haemodialysis patients whose longevity on dialysis allowed sustained 
      (10-25 years) follow-up, including annual skeletal surveys and thrice-yearly 
      clinical examinations and biochemical profiles. We compiled a dossier of clinical 
      and laboratory parameters from the start of dialysis to the present day. We were 
      able to analyze the natural history of VC and to determine which clinical parameters 
      were linked with progression. We found that VC became steadily more prevalent-at 
      dialysis onset present in 39% of the patients, but in 92% after an average dialysis 
      duration of 16 years, with a mean onset 9.7 years after starting dialysis. As well 
      as becoming more prevalent, the calcification became progressively more severe in 
      most patients. There were two patterns of VC: axial (aorta and iliac and femoral 
      arteries), seen alone in 32% of the patients, and peripheral (digital arteries), 
      seen alone in 3% of patients. Most patients (65%) had evidence of both types. 
      Calcification was scored for site and severity. Patient age (r = 0.57, p < 0.001), 
      systolic blood pressure (r = 0.54, p < 0.001), hyperparathyroidism (reduced 
      progression after parathyroidectomy), plasma phosphate (r = 0.34, p = 0.042), and 
      vitamin D concentrations (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) were the principal determinants of 
      severity and rate of progression of VC in this population. There was a weak negative 
      association between progression and serum ferritin (r = -0.33, p = 0.046). The 
      reduced vessel compliance that results from VC is likely to be cardiovascularly 
      deleterious. In severe cases, tissue perfusion or vascular access for haemodialysis 
      can be compromised. VC and accelerated cardiovascular mortality are common to 
      uraemia, diabetes, and systolic hypertension in the elderly. Better understanding of 
      these pathological processes may permit intervention and possibly lead to a 
      reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

TI  - Effects of oral vitamin D(3) supplementation in stage 3 chronic kidney disease 
      subjects: insulin resistance syndrome and hormonal disturb interactions.
PG  - 313-325
LID - 10.1684/abc.2018.1342 [doi]
AB  - The 1-25-hydroxyvitamine D (1-25OHD) or calcitriol deficiency in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients was associated with increases vascular calcification risk, 
      nephrons reduction, bone deficit and cardiovascular mortality by atherosclerosis. 
      The objective of this study was to investigate the pleiotropic effects of 200.000 IU 
      (D(200) group) every 3 months versus 30.000 IU (D(30) group) every month dose 
      vitamin D supplementation in stage 3 CKD patients. A cohort of 132 adult subjects 
      was randomized into 2 groups according to dose vitamin D supplementation in 
      deficient subjects (25OHD <50 nmol/L or <20 ng/mL). Serum 25OHD levels were assessed 
      before and after 6 and 12 months of vitamin D supplementation. Patients were 
      phenotyped for IRS according to NCEP/ATPIII. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the 
      MDRD formula. Insulin resistance was evaluated by the Homa-IR model. IRS clusters by 
      Cobas Integra 400®. PTH, Cortisol and IGF-1 were determined by radioimmunologic 
      methods. The 25OHD profile was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Results showed that vitamin D 
      supplementation increased serum 25OHD concentrations (>75 nmol/L or >30 ng/mL) in 
      both groups; however, the supplementation benefits are more significant in D(30) 
      group than in D(200) group. We noted a highlighted improvement of kidney function, 
      an inhibition of GFR collaps, a safe reduction of proteinuria, a significant PTH and 
      C-reactive protein (inflammation) levels attenuation, concomitantly with 
      cortisolemia normalization and decreased IGF-1 depletion. Nevertheless, homocysteine 
      and Lp(a) concentrations remain increased, not modulated by vitamin D treatment. 
      This study shows that continuous low doses (30.000 IU every month) are recommended 
      for intermittent high doses (200.000 IU every 3 months) vitamin D supplementation. 
      Our study suggests that the serum 25OHD profile can be considered a reliable 
      biomarker in the bioclinic CKD status to stage stabilization and inhibit its 
      evolution.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - Parathyroidectomy was carried out in 26 patients over a 14-year period. Excellent 
      results were obtained in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism. Vascular 
      calcification, hypercalcaemia and pruritus did not justify surgery unless associated 
      with unequivocal hyperparathyroidism. 13 patients required intravenous calcium 
      infusion for up to 2 weeks to control post-operative hypocalcaemia. Calcium 
      requirements could be predicted from the pre-operative plasma alkaline phosphatase 
      level. Following operation continued treatment with vitamin D was necessary to 
      prevent hypocalcaemia. Hyperparathyroidism recurred in 1 patient after 8 years and 4 
      patients developed osteomalacia. Since parathyroid hormone may have toxic effects 
      other than those on bone, maintenance of normal levels should be a long-term 
      objective in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure. Where large 
      parathyroid glands are present, surgical reduction in gland mass is a logical 
      prelude to long-term suppression of parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and 
      phosphate-binding agents.

TI  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary hypertension in older 
      patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria.
PG  - 353-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-014-0889-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary vascular calcification and 
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a chronic kidney failure dog model, and increased 
      prevalence of PH and a PH-hyperparathyroidism relationship in pre-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis patients are reported. This study investigated 
      the prevalence of PH and relationships between PH and metabolic abnormalities in 
      patients with stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD. METHODS: One-hundred and ninety patients 
      (mean age 61 ± 17.4, 116 males) with proteinuria CKD and no coronary diseases, 
      congestive heart failure, smoking history, and pulmonary diseases were enrolled. 
      Estimated glomerular filtration rate was 39.7 ± 23 ml/min. CKD etiology was diabetes 
      mellitus in 52 (27.3 %), chronic glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis 
      in 56 (29.4 %), hypertension in 36 (19 %), and other etiologies (nephrolithiasis, 
      obstructive nephropathy, and amyloidosis) in 46 (25.3 %) patients. Echocardiography 
      was performed, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left ventricular 
      ejection fraction were determined. Laboratory tests examined lipid parameters, serum 
      albumin, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein, parathyroid 
      hormone, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels. RESULTS: PH (PAP >35 mmHg) was detected in 
      68 patients (35.9 %). Patients with PH were older (68 ± 12.3 vs. 52.1 ± 16.7, p = 
      0.03), had lower ejection fractions (51.3 ± 13.4 vs. 60.8 ± 9.1 %, p = 0.003), lower 
      hemoglobin (11.3 ± 1.5 vs. 12.1 ± 1.9, p = 0.05), and higher parathyroid hormone 
      (218 ± 159.3 vs. 127.7 ± 67.4 pg/ml, p = 0.05) levels. The remaining parameters were 
      similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, lower ejection fraction, and 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to PH in stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD.

AB  - Osteoprotegerin (OPG) regulates bone mass by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation 
      and activation, and plays a role in vascular calcification. We evaluated the 
      relationship between osteoprotegerin levels and inflammatory markers, 
      atherosclerosis, and mortality in patients with stages 3-5 chronic kidney disease. A 
      total of 145 subjects (median age 61 years, 61% men; 36 patients on hemodialysis, 55 
      patients on peritoneal dialysis, and 54 patients with stages 3-5 chronic kidney 
      disease) were studied. Clinical characteristics, markers of mineral metabolism 
      (including fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23]) and inflammation (high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and the intima-media thickness 
      (IMT) in the common carotid arteries were measured at baseline. Cardiac function was 
      assessed by color tissue Doppler echocardiography. After 36 months follow-up, the 
      survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis was significantly different according to OPG 
      levels (χ ² =14.33; P=0.002). Increased OPG levels were positively associated with 
      IL-6 (r=0.38, P<0.001), FGF-23 (r=0.26, P<0.001) and hsCRP (r=0.0.24, P=0.003). In 
      addition, OPG was positively associated with troponin I (r=0.54, P<0.001) and IMT 
      (r=0.39, P<0.0001). Finally, in Cox analysis, only OPG (HR=1.07, 95%CI=1.02-1.13) 
      and hsCRP (HR=1.02, 95%CI=1.01-1.04) were independently associated with increased 
      risk of death. These results suggested that elevated levels of serum OPG might be 
      associated with atherosclerosis and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease.

AB  - This study examined the characteristics of biochemical parameters, bone diseases, 
      and vascular calcification in Korean patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not 
      yet on dialysis. Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 
      (1,25D); lumbar spine, total hip, and femur neck bone mineral densities; and 
      brachial-to-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) representing vascular calcification 
      were measured at baseline for 2,238 CKD patients in the KoreaN Cohort Study for 
      Outcomes in Patients With CKD (KNOW-CKD). Increases in serum FGF23 and iPTH preceded 
      changes in serum calcium and phosphate, similar to Western populations. However, the 
      25D and 1,25D levels decreased earlier than serum FGF23 or iPTH increased, with a 
      decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Korean CKD patients. 
      Vitamin D deficiency occurred in 76.7% of patients with CKD stage 1. Bone mineral 
      densities were lowest in CKD stage 5 (lumbar spine, -0.64 ± 1.67; total hip, -0.49 ± 
      1.21; femur neck, -1.02 ± 1.25). Osteoporosis was more prevalent in patients with 
      higher CKD stages. The mean baPWV, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), and 
      coronary calcium score also increased, with declined eGFR. In conclusion, a decline 
      in serum vitamin D levels was observed in early CKD stages before significant 
      increases of FGF23 and iPTH in the Korean CKD population compared with that in 
      Western populations. Increased bone disease and vascular calcification occurred in 
      early-stage CKD.

AB  - We present the third case and first reported survivor of penile gangrene due to 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism from chronic renal failure. The patient was treated 
      with distal penectomy and subtotal parathyroidectomy. This case stimulated us to 
      review the metabolic and vascular changes associated with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may 
      cause diffuse vasculitis and vascular calcification, which can lead to widespread 
      ischemic necrosis and gangrene. Early medical therapy, including oral phosphate 
      binders, is crucial to maintain the serum calcium-phosphate product below 
      precipitation level. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is indicated for patients in whom 
      progressive arterial and soft tissue calcification develops despite medical therapy.

TI  - Calcium exposure and removal in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 41-6
AB  - The risks associated with calcium exposure in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients are 
      becoming increasingly apparent. Current K/DOQI guidelines recommend an absolute 
      maximum elemental calcium load of 2,000 mg/d, including calcium-containing 
      medication and a maximum dialysate calcium concentration of 1.25 mmol/L (to avoid 
      intradialytic calcium loading). The goal of this study was to characterize the total 
      exposure to calcium from all sources that chronic HD patients are exposed to. We 
      studied 52 patients. Each was requested to complete a 3-day food diary for analysis 
      of daily calcium intake; 24-hour urine collections were taken and analyzed for 
      calcium content. All patients underwent HD using Hospal Integra (Lyon, France) 
      dialysis monitors, bicarbonate buffering, and dialysate sodium and calcium 
      concentrations of 134 mmol/L and 1.25 mmol/L, respectively. Blood was sampled before 
      and after HD for total serum calcium, albumin, bicarbonate, and phosphate, in 
      addition to ionized calcium level measured at the bedside using a portable 
      electrolyte analyzer. Calcium flux was determined from measurements of ionized 
      calcium levels in dialyzer inlet samples and those in continuous partial waste 
      dialysis collection (with reference to total waste dialysate and ultrafiltration 
      volumes). There was marked interpatient variability of total calcium exposure; the 
      mean was 2,346 +/- 293 mg (range, 230 to 7,309 mg) per day. The majority of enteral 
      calcium exposure was from calcium-containing phosphate binders, with diet providing 
      only a mean load of 581 +/- 34 mg (range, 230 to 1,309 mg). Calcium removal was 
      evident in 83% of patients. Mean calcium flux was -187 +/- 232 mg (range, -486 to 
      784 mg). There was a linear correlation observed between the amount of calcium 
      removed during dialysis and the predialysis ionized plasma calcium concentration, r2 
      = 0.42, P < .001 (calculated from actual measured dialysate ionized calcium 
      concentration). This shows that calcium flux across the dialysis membrane is 
      determined by the diffusion gradient. The amount of calcium removed during dialysis 
      was found to be independent of exogenous calcium load. These results support 
      previous reported data showing that the majority of HD patients are continually 
      experiencing calcium overload. This may have a contributory role in the development 
      of vascular calcification. In contrast to recent K/DOQI recommendations, an upper 
      dialysate concentration of 1.25 mmol/L may not be ideal for every patient. To 
      minimize the effects of exogenous calcium overload, dialysate concentrations should 
      be prescribed with reference to plasma calcium levels.

TI  - [Calcyphylaxis in a patient with end-stage renal disease in the course of systemic 
      lupus erythematosus, diagnostic problems--case report].
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Calcyphylaxis consists in vascular calcium deposition and skin necrosis, which 
      appears in the final stage of renal failure. Advanced forms of systemic connective 
      tissue disease such as lupus erythematosus, especially with concomitant vasculitis, 
      leading to renal failure and uremia may be conducive to calcyphylaxis. We are 
      presenting a case of a 50-year-old male requiring chronic peritoneal dialysis since 
      the age of 43, due to end-stage renal disease resulting from chronic 
      glomeluronephritis. The patient presented to our Dermatology Department with large 
      and painful coalescent cutaneous lesions on both lower extremities, fingertips and 
      lips. Both clinical picture and disease history indicated systemic vasculitis that 
      was previously unrecognized. Additional examinations revealed the following markers 
      of inflammation: leukocytosis (11 G/I) with normal level of eosinophils, CRP > 0.6 
      mg/I, ESR 120 mm/h, and IgG 20 g/l, without any source of infection. Indirect 
      immunofluorescence showed the absence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 
      (ANCA) on polynuclear leucocytes. A distinct fluorescence pattern observed in liver 
      sinusoids was suggestive of the presence of some form of anti-granulocyte 
      antibodies. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected in serum (1:1000) with 
      homogenous and microgranular fluorescence pattern. Anti-extractable nuclear antigen 
      panel (ENA), C3/C4 levels, anti-smooth muscle, anti-dsDNA and anti-glomerular 
      basement membrane (GBM) antibodies were within normal limits. Lupus band test 
      revealed IgA and IgG deposits at the dermis-epidermis junction. Histopathological 
      examination of the skin showed calcification complicated by small vessel thrombosis, 
      however, it was non-specific for vasculitis. Our case represents an example of 
      calcyphylaxis associated with a widespread medial vascular calcification in a 
      patient with end stage renal disease secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus. 
      Although renal dialysis itself is known to trigger calcyphylaxis, there have been 
      few reports in literature suggesting that collagen vascular disease may also 
      contribute to this process.

LID - 10.1159/000484418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of bone 
      morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal transduction in the pathogenesis of 
      calciphylaxis. METHODS: Skin biopsy specimens were obtained from 18 patients with, 
      and 12 patients without, calciphylaxis. Tissue sections were stained with antibodies 
      directed against BMP effector proteins phosphorylated-SMAD (p-SMAD) 1/5/9, inhibitor 
      of DNA 1 (Id1), inhibitor of DNA 3 (Id3), and Runx2. The intensity of staining was 
      scored semi-quantitatively as strong versus weak or absent. RESULTS: Of the 18 
      patients with calciphylaxis (mean age: 59 ± 8 years), 9 were women and 15 had 
      end-stage renal disease. Of the 12 control patients (mean age: 57 ± 10 years), 8 
      were women and 8 had end-stage renal disease. Strong staining for p-SMAD 1/5/9 was 
      detected in blood vessels from all calciphylaxis patients. In 1 patient with 
      calciphylaxis, strong staining for p-SMAD 1/5/9 was detected in a blood vessel that 
      did not have evidence of calcification. Id1 and Id3 immunoreactivity was detected in 
      blood vessels from all 12 patients with calciphylaxis that were tested. Runx2 
      staining was detected in all 6 patients with calciphylaxis who were tested. p-SMAD 
      1/5/9 immunoreactivity was weak or absent in blood vessels of 10 of the 12 control 
      samples. CONCLUSIONS: The BMP signal transduction pathway is activated in the 
      cutaneous vasculature of calciphylaxis patients. The ability to detect p-SMAD 1/5/9, 
      Id1, and Id3 in cutaneous vasculature may assist in the diagnosis of calciphylaxis. 
      As BMP signaling inhibitors become available, this pathway may serve as a future 
      therapeutic target for calciphylaxis.

      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 229-35
LID - 10.3233/DMA-130965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification, including arterial intimal and medial 
      calcification (AIC and AMC) and valvular calcification (VC) are important predictors 
      of outcome in chronic dialysis patients. We aimed to compare their prevalence and 
      analyze respective risk factors in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: A total of 
      81 HD patients were enrolled. Vascular calcification was assessed by plain film 
      radiography of the pelvis and VC was diagnosed by echocardiography. Demographic data 
      was reviewed and serum levels of calcification-relevant biomarkers were determined. 
      Patients with and without calcification were then compared. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      study indicated that 36 patients had AIC (44.4%), 17 had AMC (21%) and 60 (74.1%) 
      had VC. Patients with vascular calcification were older, and had a higher prevalence 
      of diabetes. Their IL-6, osteoprotegerin, and uric acid levels were higher. Serum 
      fetuin-A was lower in patients with VC. Logistic regression analysis revealed age, 
      uric acid and diabetes to be independently associated with AIC; uric acid, diabetes 
      and osteoprotegerin with AMC. Fetuin-A was the sole associate of VC. CONCLUSIONS: It 
      is concluded that the prevalence of cardiovascular calcification in chronic HD 
      patients was high with cardiac valve involvement more frequent. Factors associated 
      with different type of calcification were not identical. Changes in biomarkers may 
      represent clinical clues for assessment of cardiovascular calcification in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Calciphylaxis: a poor prognostic indicator for limb salvage.
PG  - 1275-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy) is a rare complication 
      of end-stage renal disease in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. 
      Subcutaneous skin nodules and extensive tissue necrosis with vascular calcification 
      characterize this process. DESIGN AND SETTING: The design of the study included case 
      series and literature review. The study was set in a tertiary care hospital. 
      PATIENTS: Four patients presented over an 8-month period with extensive tissue loss 
      and the subsequent diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Two of these patients were 
      revascularized. One underwent primary amputation, and the final patient died before 
      revascularization. The mortality rate for this group was 75%. All patients had 
      significant vascular complications outside the area of initial presentation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These individuals represent a subset of patients who may not benefit 
      from revascularization or may require extensive regulation of divalent metabolism 
      before consideration for revascularization.

TI  - Vitamin K intake and mortality in people with chronic kidney disease from NHANES 
      III.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), partly due to increased vascular 
      calcification. Vitamin K plays a role in preventing vascular calcification in CKD 
      yet the relationship between vitamin K intake and mortality in CKD patients remains 
      unclear. METHODS: This observational cohort study included 3401 participants with 
      CKD from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Vitamin K 
      intake was estimated from 24-h dietary recalls (1988-94). Mortality was determined 
      from the National Death Index records through 2006. Cox-proportional hazards 
      regression was used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) by comparing those with adequate 
      intake of vitamin K to those with low intake, adjusting for advanced CKD covariates. 
      For sensitivity analysis, these associations were also examined among those with 
      different renal status. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.3 years (37,408 
      person-years), 1815 and 876 participants died from all-cause and CVD causes, 
      respectively. 72% of the participants had vitamin K intake lower than the 
      recommended adequate intake. Participants with vitamin K intake higher than 
      recommended adequate intake for vitamin K were associated with lower risk of 
      all-cause (HR = 0.85; 95%: 0.72-1; P = 0.047) and CVD mortality (HR = 0.78; 95%: 
      0.64-95; P = 0.016). Sensitivity analyses in subgroups with advanced CKD revealed 
      similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study suggests that adequate 
      intake of vitamin K may be associated with reduced all-cause and CVD mortality in 
      CKD patients. However, vitamin K may be a marker of a healthy diet; therefore 
      clinical trials may help in clarifying the effect of vitamin K independent of a 
      healthy diet.

PG  - 592-5

AB  - Vascular calcification is present in arterial vessels used for dialysis vascular 
      access creation prior to surgical creation. Calcification in the veins used to 
      create a new vascular access has not previously been documented. The objective of 
      this study was to describe the prevalence of venous calcification in samples 
      collected at the time of vascular access creation. Sixty-seven vein samples were 
      studied. A von Kossa stain was performed to quantify calcification. A 
      semi-quantitative scoring system from 0 to 4+ was used to quantify the percentage 
      positive area for calcification as a fraction of total area (0: 0; 1+: 1-10%; 2+: 
      11-25%; 3+: 26-50%; 4+: >50% positive). Twenty-two of 67 (33%) samples showed 
      evidence of venous calcification. Histologic examination showed varying degrees of 
      calcification within each cell layer. Among the subset of patients with 
      calcification, 4/22 (18%), 19/22 (86%), 22/22 (100%), and 7/22 (32%) had 
      calcification present within the endothelium, intima, media, and adventitia, 
      respectively. The mean semi-quantitative scores of the 22 samples with calcification 
      were 0.18 ± 0.08, 1.2 ± 0.14, 1.6 ± 0.13, and 0.36 ± 0.12 for the endothelium, 
      intima, media, and adventitia, respectively. Our results demonstrate that vascular 
      calcification is present within veins used to create new dialysis vascular access, 
      and located predominately within the neointimal and medial layers.

TI  - A novel prognostic index for mortality in renal transplant recipients after 
      hospitalization.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prognostic indices that estimate long-term mortality are essential not 
      only to compare different clinical studies and populations but also to perform the 
      most appropriate therapeutic interventions. All-cause mortality is high after renal 
      transplantation (RTx), but no prognostic index has focused on predicting mortality 
      in RTx. We developed and tested a prognostic index for mortality in RTx after 
      hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed survival in 1,293 RTx 
      recipients who were randomly assigned to two groups: a modeling population (n=646), 
      used to create the new index, and a testing population (n=647), used to test this 
      index. Patients were stratified into three risk groups (low, medium, and high) by 
      combining peritransplant risk factors for mortality (beta-coefficient), using a 
      simple eight-point check list: age, pretransplant cardiovascular disease, renal 
      dysfunction at discharge, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular calcification, diabetes, 
      time on dialysis, and acute tubular necrosis. RESULTS: Overall lower survival rates 
      were observed with increasing risk classes in the testing population (log-rank 
      test=18; P=0.0001). The 8-year survival rates ranged from 94% in the lowest-risk 
      group to 59% in the highest-risk group. The area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve was 0.63. Mortality risk (Cox analysis) significantly increased 
      with increasing risk classes (medium risk: relative risk=3.8, 95% confidence 
      interval=1.5-9.5, P=0.004; high risk: relative risk=6.3, 95% confidence 
      interval=2.4-16.2, P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This simple prognostic index applicable 
      at the bedside may accurately predict survival in RTx recipients after discharge. 
      Consequently, targeted treatment interventions may be indicated for minimizing 
      mortality, especially in high-risk groups.

AB  - Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (HD) are known to have abnormal blood 
      concentrations of antioxidant minerals; concurrent oxidative stress can contribute 
      to increased vascular calcification. This study aims to evaluate the associations 
      between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of vascular 
      calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant minerals 
      (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and several promoters 
      and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP), fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9), and tissue inhibitors 
      of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in HD patients (n = 62) and 
      age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 30). Compared with healthy subjects, 
      HD patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu 
      and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn 
      ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that HD patients had significantly lower 
      concentrations of MGP and higher levels of FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and 
      MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios. We also observed significant relationships 
      between the concentrations of these minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD 
      patients. These results suggest that changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant 
      minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and 
      inflammatory status, thereby participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing long-term HD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are unable to compensate for an 
      enlarged mineral load with increased excretion of calcium and phosphate in the 
      urine. Hence, excess calcium and phosphate must be neutralized by other mechanisms 
      to avoid toxicity. The present study examined the acute handling of a mineral load 
      in HD patients as compared with healthy subjects. DESIGN: Controlled intervention 
      study. SUBJECTS: Twelve HD patients and 12 matched healthy subjects. INTERVENTION: 
      After a weight-adjusted standardized meal, blood samples were collected for the 
      following 9 hours for ionized calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). The fractional excretion of calcium and 
      phosphate was measured in controls. The patients were not allowed to take phosphate 
      binders 24 hours before the experiment, and the study was performed on a non-HD day. 
      RESULTS: In healthy subjects, plasma calcium and phosphate did not change 
      significantly from baseline, whereas HD patients demonstrated a decrease in plasma 
      phosphate from 60 to 120 minutes by maximum 10% ([6; 13%], mean [95% confidence 
      interval], P < .001) below baseline. PTH increased in both HD patients and controls 
      and peaked 300 minutes after the meal 11% ([4; 19%], P < .004) above baseline in 
      both groups. No changes in FGF23 were observed in HD patients, whereas FGF23 
      steadily decreased in controls, reaching nadir values at the end of the study 16% 
      ([10; 21%], P < .001) below baseline. Control subjects demonstrated an immediate 
      postprandial increase in the fractional excretion of both calcium and phosphate 
      CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, the mineral load paradoxically induced a decrease in 
      plasma phosphate, whereas ionized calcium remained unchanged although PTH increased. 
      These findings suggest that excess calcium and phosphate may be disposed of by 
      mineral deposition, which may include soft tissue and vascular calcification.

TI  - Oral Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation Does Not Affect Serum Calcification 
      Propensity in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and Chronic Metabolic Acidosis.
PG  - 188-199
LID - 10.1159/000498975 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis might accelerate vascular 
      calcification. The T50 calcification inhibition test (T50-test) is a global 
      functional test analyzing the overall propensity of calcification in serum, and low 
      T50-time is associated with progressive aortic stiffening and with all-cause 
      mortality in non-dialysis CKD, dialysis, and transplant patients. Low serum 
      bicarbonate is associated with a short T50-time and alkali supplementation could be 
      a simple modifier of calcification propensity. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the short-term effect of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation on 
      T50-time in CKD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SoBic-study is an ongoing 
      randomized-controlled trial in CKD-G3 and G4 patients with chronic metabolic 
      acidosis (serum HCO3- ≤21 mmol/L), in which patients are randomized to either 
      achieve serum HCO3- levels of 24 ± 1 mmol/L (intervention group) or 20 ± 1 mmol/L 
      (rescue group). The effect of bicarbonate treatment on T50-time was assessed. 
      RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 35 (14 female) patients aged 57 (±15) years, 
      and 18 were randomized to the intervention group. The mean T50-time was 275 (± 64) 
      min. After 4 weeks, the mean change of T50-time was 4 (±69) min in the intervention 
      group and 18 min (±56) in the rescue group (β = -25; 95% CI: -71 to 22; p = 0.298). 
      Moreover, change of serum bicarbonate in individual patients was not associated with 
      change in T50-time, analyzed by regression analysis. Change of serum phosphate had a 
      significant impact on change of T50-time (β = -145; 95% CI: -237 to -52). 
      CONCLUSION: Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation showed no effect on T50-time in 
      acidotic CKD patients.

TI  - Pathophysiological aspects of vascular calcification in chronic renal failure.
PG  - 96-9
AB  - The nephrology community has progressively recognized that vascular calcification in 
      patients with chronic renal failure is a major problem in terms of morbidity and 
      mortality. This type of soft tissue calcification is not only passive, as thought 
      previously, but implies active processes as well. It results from disturbances of 
      the normal balance between calcification inhibitors and promoters, acting both at 
      the systemic and the local level, and from the phenotypic change of smooth muscle 
      cells towards osteoblast-like calcifying cells in the vessel wall. The recognition 
      of the main factors involved will allow in the future a more appropriate 
      prophylactic and therapeutic approach of this clinically important complication of 
      chronic renal failure.

TI  - Significant association between the presence of peripheral vascular calcification 
      and lower serum magnesium in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 222-7
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification, which significantly increases cardiovascular and other 
      causes of mortality, is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients. The aim of the 
      present study was to examine the association between serum magnesium levels and 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: 390 nondiabetic patients 
      on maintenance hemodialysis (226 males and 164 females, 59 +/- 13 years) were 
      examined. Hand roentgenography was performed in each patient, and visible vascular 
      calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Blood was drawn to measure serum 
      calcium, phosphate, magnesium and intact parathyroid hormone levels. RESULTS: There 
      were 52 patients (38 males and 14 females) with vascular calcification, and 338 (188 
      males and 150 females) without. Serum phosphate was significantly higher in the 
      former compared with the latter group (p < 0.005); serum intact parathyroid hormone 
      was significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas serum calcium was not statistically 
      different between the two groups. Serum magnesium was significantly lower in 
      patients with vascular calcification than in those without (2.69 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.78 
      +/- 0.33 mg/dl, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      serum magnesium concentration was a significant independent factor associated with 
      the presence of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients (odds ratio 0.28, 
      95% CI 0.09 - 0.92/1 mg/dl increase in serum magnesium, p = 0.036) after adjustment 
      for age, gender, duration of hemodialysis, calcium, phosphate and intact parathyroid 
      hormone concentrations. CONCLUSION: Hypomagnesemia is significantly associated with 
      the presence of vascular calcification of the hand arteries, independent of serum 
      calcium and phosphate levels. These results suggest that higher serum magnesium 
      concentrations may play an important protective role in the development of vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients, and that magnesium concentration of dialysis 
      fluid may be reconsidered in view of preventing vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.

      (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of morbimortality. Specific 
      risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional factors do not 
      fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of 
      atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The potential use 
      of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis has to be determined. 
      METHODS: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were 
      enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. 
      Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no 
      previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were also recruited. Demographical, clinical and 
      analytical data were collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a 
      single trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect 
      atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured. RESULTS: Differences 
      in age, sex and prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found 
      between controls and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described 
      in epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls 
      and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted); 
      earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of atheromatous 
      plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted analysis. A group of 
      patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, 
      and would have gone underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of 
      pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages, 
      and a higher rate of ABI >1.4 than <0.9, suggesting more vascular calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual prevalence of 
      subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of 
      atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important 
      information to the pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to 
      non-CKD subjects.

TI  - Fulminant metastatic calcinosis with cutaneous necrosis in a child with end-stage 
      renal disease and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 617-22
AB  - Metastatic calcinosis is a common feature of chronic renal failure. Its first 
      manifestations are bone demineralization and non-visceral and/or visceral 
      calcification with mostly mural deposits in arteries and arterioles. It is initially 
      characterized by hyperphosphataemia followed by secondary or tertiary 
      hyperparathyroidism. Cutaneous involvement is a rare complication. Histologically, 
      the lesions show vascular calcification with ischaemic skin necrosis. Extreme cases 
      may produce calcinosis cutis (calciphylaxis), i.e. disseminated calcification of the 
      subcutaneous tissue and dermis in the form of hard painful cutaneous nodules and 
      plaques with subsequent ulceration. Metastatic calcinosis is a disease affecting 
      adults, while the dystrophic or idiopathic type can develop in children. We present 
      the case of a 6-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease, attributed to congenital 
      renal hypoplasia, and accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism. He developed 
      fulminant tertiary hyperparathyroidism and metastatic calcinosis of the lungs, as 
      well as cutaneous necrosis of the buttocks and legs, subsequent to calcification of 
      arteries and arterioles. A maternal renal transplant failed to function. The serum 
      parathormone, calcium and phosphate levels could not be controlled by maintenance 
      dialysis, phosphate binders and calcitriol. Total parathyroidectomy without 
      autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue rapidly returned the serum parathormone, 
      calcium and phosphate levels to normal. In addition, topical treatment using 
      merbromine solution and hydrocolloid dressings, healed the ulcers with significant 
      scar formation, within 2.5 months after parathyroidectomy. A renewed increase of the 
      calcium x phosphate product, 2 months after parathyroidectomy, was attributed to 
      mobilization of calcium compounds from the viscera, as confirmed by a chest X-ray.

TI  - Influence of Carnicor, Venofer, and Sevelamer on the levels of genotoxic damage in 
      end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 302-311
LID - 10.1002/em.22170 [doi]
AB  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients present high levels of phosphorus and 
      calcium products in serum, which contribute to the development of vascular 
      calcification and cardiovascular disease, and to low iron stores and carnitine 
      deficiency. For these reasons, ESRD patients are generally supplemented with 
      different medicines. Some of the most common treatments include the use of Carnicor, 
      Venofer, and Sevelamer drugs. Carnicor is used as a source of L-carnitine, acting as 
      antioxidant and neuroprotector. Venofer is used to reduce the deficit of iron. 
      Sevelamer is used to treat hyperphosphatemia. To determine the potential harmful 
      genotoxic effects of these drugs, a group of 214 patients included in a hemodialysis 
      program with different intakes of Carnicor, Venofer, and Sevelamer were evaluated. 
      The levels of basal and oxidative DNA damage, as well as chromosomal damage, were 
      measured in all individuals using the comet and the micronucleus assays, 
      respectively. Our results indicate that Carnicor administration was associated with 
      low but significant increases in the frequency of basal DNA damage and micronuclei.

LID - 10.1159/000210033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective was to investigate the status of vascular calcification, 
      and to explore factors influencing vascular calcification in maintenance 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Vascular calcification was quantitatively evaluated 
      using radiographic films of the abdomen, pelvis and hands. Plasma fetuin-A and other 
      parameters related to calcification were examined. RESULTS: 33/50 cases of vascular 
      calcification were identified by radiographic film. Calcifications of the abdominal 
      aorta and peripheral muscular arteries were seen in 90.9 and 36.4%. Patients with 
      moderate to severe calcification were older, more likely to be male, had lower 
      diastolic blood pressure and fetuin-A levels, and a higher incidence of diabetes 
      than those with mild calcification. Logistic regression analysis showed that 
      diabetes and plasma fetuin-A were independent risk factors for vascular 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular calcification was present in a large proportion 
      of maintenance hemodialysis patients, most frequently in the abdominal aorta. 
      Diabetes and plasma fetuin-A levels were independent risk factors for vascular 
      calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are associated with risk of vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification is a common complication among dialysis patients and 
      its pathogenesis involves a variety of factors. The roles of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines and residual kidney function (RKF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients 
      with vascular calcification have not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 
      stable PD patients were enrolled. All patients had plain X-ray film examination 
      including chest (posterior-anterior view, CXR) and pelvis. Vascular calcification 
      was interpreted as calcified deposit over aortic arch and linear calcification of 
      pelvic arteries. Relevant biochemical data, pro-inflammatory markers, and PD-related 
      factors were measured and collected. RESULTS: Vascular calcification prevalence in 
      CXRs was higher than that in pelvis films (38.2% vs. 22.3%, p < 0.05). Patients with 
      vascular calcification in CXR had higher incidence of calcification in pelvis films 
      (p < 0.05). Only a minor portion (14.6%) had two calcification sites. Regression 
      analysis revealed that age, PD duration, body mass index, and RKF were independent 
      factors associated with vascular calcification in CXR. Age, diabetes, IL-10 and RKF 
      were factors associated in pelvis films. Factors independently related to vascular 
      calcification in both films were age, duration, diabetes, IL-10, and RKF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Besides traditional risk factors, IL-10 and RKF were important factors 
      associated with vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Tender, necrotic plaques of the glans penis due to calciphylaxis.
LID - 13030/qt1hs0c1gm [pii]
AB  - Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare, but often 
      fatal condition involving vascular calcification that can result in tissue ischemia 
      and cutaneous necrosis. It is most often seen in patients with renal failure among 
      many other occasionally reported etiologies. Below, we present a rare and 
      challenging case of calciphylaxis involving the glans penis and right leg in a man 
      with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

TI  - Impact of ENPP1 genotype on arterial calcification in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates 
      inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological 
      inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with 
      generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q 
      variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with 
      end-stage renal failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 79 patients with 
      end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the 
      ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype 
      (n=15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and 
      duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary 
      calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was 
      measured by pulse-wave analysis. RESULTS: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a 
      significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30; P=0.033), and also a 
      higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK 
      genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study 
      suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification 
      of patients with end-stage renal failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q 
      polymorphism have higher coronary calcification scores and increased aortic 
      stiffness, and may benefit from more intense treatment in order to prevent 
      progression of arterial calcification.

TI  - Association of AHSG gene polymorphisms and aortic stiffness in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 510-7
LID - 10.1159/000309789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fetuin-A is a negative acute-phase reactant and extraosseous 
      calcification inhibitor. Decreased serum concentration of fetuin-A is independently 
      related to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Our aim is 
      to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphism of 
      alpha(2)-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein (AHSG) encoding fetuin-A and its serum 
      concentration, vascular calcification, and aortic stiffness in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. METHOD: A total of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
      AHSG gene were genotyped and evaluated for association with serum fetuin-A level, 
      quantitative measures of vascular calcification and aortic stiffness represented by 
      heart-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (hfPWV). RESULTS: Five SNPs in the AHSG gene 
      were nominally associated with the serum fetuin-A level in our PD patients. In 
      haplotype analyses, there were haplotypes positively (H1; AGCA, H2; CC) and 
      inversely (H1; TTCG, H2; TT) related with the serum fetuin-A level. The serum 
      fetuin-A level inversely and independently correlated with hfPWV. Moreover, the 
      serum fetuin-A concentration was a determinant for the simple vascular calcification 
      score (SVCS), which subsequently was associated with hfPWV. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      showed an association between AHSG polymorphism and its serum concentration, and 
      also revealed an association of the serum fetuin-A level with SVCS and aortic 
      stiffness in PD patients.

TI  - Fetuin-A, coronary artery calcification and outcome in maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have suggested that serum fetuin-A, a 
      calcification inhibitor, predicts mortality in dialysis patients. This study 
      investigated the relationships between fetuin-A, vascular calcification, and outcome 
      in such patients. METHODS: 58 patients on maintenance hemodialysis underwent 
      multirow spiral computed tomography to determine baseline coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) score. Serum fetuin-A was measured repeatedly over time. 
      RESULTS: Time-averaged fetuin-A inversely correlated with age and baseline CAC 
      score. After partial correlation analysis controlling for age, the association 
      between fetuin-A and CAC became insignificant. During the study, 27 of 58 patients 
      died and 26 experienced at least one cardiovascular event. Low fetuin-A was 
      associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality and the occurrence of 
      a cardiovascular event. The association of fetuin-A with mortality and 
      cardiovascular event remained significant even when adjusting for confounding 
      factors, including age and CAC score. CONCLUSION: Time-averaged fetuin-A was 
      associated with survival and cardiovascular outcome, independent of vascular 
      calcification.

TI  - Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are independent predictors of left 
      ventricular hypertrophy in chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 760-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in HD patients and 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification measured by electron beam computed 
      tomography (EBCT). METHODS: In a cohort of 118 HD patients (52 male, 66 female, mean 
      age: 46+/-13 years), we measured biochemical parameters, including BUN, creatinine, 
      albumin, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, and performed 
      echocardiography, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography and EBCT in 85 of 
      them. The degree of stenosis was measured at four different sites (communis, bulbus, 
      interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. Carotid plaque scores were calculated 
      by summing the degrees of stenosis measured at all locations. RESULTS: LVH was 
      detected in 89 of the patients (75%). Plaque-positive patients had higher left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) than plaque-negative patients (175+/-59 vs 143+/-46 
      g/m2, P = 0.003). LVMI was correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, 
      P<0.001), pulse pressure (r = 0.58, P<0.001), haemoglobin levels (r = - 0.25, P = 
      0.008), carotid plaque score (r = 0.32, P = 0.001) and coronary (CACS) and aortic 
      wall calcification score (AWCS) (r = 0.34, P = 0.002 and r = 0.43, P<0.001, 
      respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis (model r = 0.76) showed the 
      independent factors related to LVMI to be systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, 
      CACS and presence of carotid plaques. CONCLUSION: Extra-coronary atherosclerosis and 
      vascular calcification are associated with LVH in HD patients. Whether the treatment 
      of atherosclerosis or vascular calcification may cause regression of or even prevent 
      LVH in HD patients remains to be seen.

TI  - Dramatic worsening of vascular calcifications after kidney transplantation in spite 
      of early parathyroidectomy.
PG  - 487-91
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common feature in chronic dialysis patients, but their 
      clinical significance is debated and the role of kidney transplantation (TP) in the 
      natural history of their development has received scanty attention. We will describe 
      a case of dramatic worsening of vascular calcifications during TP in a young patient 
      in spite of early and successful parathyroidectomy (PTX), and will discuss other 
      causes which might be putatively linked to vascular damage during the time of TP. A 
      37-year-old man on regular dialytic treatment (RDT) for 11 years, received his first 
      cadaveric transplantation in January 1993. He underwent PTX 6 months after TP 
      because of the lack of decreasing in parathyroid hormone values despite normal graft 
      function. Although PTX was effective, a dramatic worsening was evident in large as 
      well as in medium and small-sized arteries during the following three years of TP. 
      In February 1997, few months after starting dialysis again because of the recurrence 
      of his primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), the patient 
      experienced myocardial infarction followed by aorto-coronary bypass (right coronary 
      artery and anterior descending coronary artery) and leg "claudicatio". Though a role 
      for parathyroid hormone in vascular disease has been commonly accepted, the case 
      here reported clearly shows that blunting parathyroid gland activity may be unable 
      to avoid the worsening of a process of vascular disease during the time of TP. Many 
      other factors--linked to the time of TP--may be involved in vascular diseases, such 
      as nephrotic syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension and drugs. In the case of our 
      patient, a clear cut risk factor for his progressive atherosclerosis can be 
      designated hyperlipidema and other disturbancies secondary to a nephrotic syndrome 
      due to relapse of MPGN, together with persistent hypertension. This is the first 
      case report in the English literature which clearly demonstrates that TP may add 
      fuel to the fire of vascular disease also in young people and even in the absence of 
      parathyroid hyperactivity, perhaps on the basis of a favorable genetic background. 
      Furthermore, the history of our patient demonstrates that vascular calcifcation 
      heralds major cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - [A long-term hemodialysis patient complicated with systemic calciphylaxis].
PG  - 1107-13
AB  - A 46-year-old male patient underwent long-term hemodialysis treatment had suffered 
      from calciphylaxis (defined by Selye), such symptoms as advanced systemic vascular 
      calcification, rapid progression of gangrene on both fingers and toes, disturbance 
      of consciousness, and sclerosis and obstruction of the superficial vein after 
      venipuncture during 11.5 years of dialysis. Furthermore, he had a long history (30 
      years) of heavy smoking. He died as a result of sepsis due to pneumonia after 12.5 
      years of dialysis. He had received dialysis treatment using a small amount of 
      dialysate (50 liters on a recirculating system) for 8.5 years and had been dialysed 
      2 and 2 or 3 times a week for 10 years. As a result of this insufficient dialysis 
      treatment, his characteristic laboratory data showed hypocalcemia, 
      hyperphosphatemia, elevated calcium-phosphorus product, advanced metabolic acidosis, 
      hyperalkaliphosphatemia and elevated serum parathyroid hormone. Autopsy revealed the 
      following: 1) enlargement parathyroid gland enlarged in two (4.0 g and 2.0 g, 
      respectively) showing adenomatous hyperplasia presenting cord-like arrangement of 
      chief cells and water-clear cells, 2) systemic medial calcification in radial, 
      ulnar, renal, mesenteric and brain arteries, and 3) Berline-blue positive iron 
      deposit in calcified arteries in mesenteric and parathyroid tissue. From these 
      results, we concluded that factors (challengers) related to the appearance of 
      calciphylaxis might be as follows: 1) advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism, 2) 
      long-term uremic state, 3) administration of VD2 and VD3, 4) iron salt injection, 
      and 5) a long history of heavy smoking. We speculated that these challengers might 
      act synergistically to cause calciphylaxis.

TI  - Medial artery calcification in ESRD patients is associated with deposition of bone 
      matrix proteins.
PG  - 638-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: In non-ESRD patients, recent studies have demonstrated that the process 
      of vascular calcification resembles developmental osteogenesis. Patients with ESRD 
      are known to have excessive vascular calcification, but this has previously been 
      attributed to the non-cell-mediated process of metastatic calcification. METHODS: To 
      determine if the calcification observed in patients with ESRD is related to a 
      cell-mediated process, we removed a piece of inferior epigastric artery at the time 
      of renal transplant. Calcium content of the entire vessel was quantified with spiral 
      computed tomography (CT). The vessel was then examined histologically for 
      calcification and the presence of bone matrix proteins by immunohistochemistry, and 
      medial and intimal thickness quantified by histomorphometry. These findings were 
      correlated with demographic, clinical and laboratory values. RESULTS: The proximal 
      inferior epigastric artery was obtained from 41 patients undergoing renal 
      transplantation, but two were inadequate for histologic examination. Twenty-seven of 
      the remaining vessels had no evidence of calcification by MacNeal's or Alizarin red 
      pH 4.2 staining, five vessels had mild/moderate calcification, and seven had severe 
      calcification, all in the medial layer. Calcification assessed histologically was 
      closely correlated with calcification score as assessed by spiral CT, normalized for 
      vessel weight (P=0.027). Positive immunostaining for the bone matrix proteins 
      osteopontin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and alkaline phosphatase was 
      strongly correlated with calcification (all P < or = 0.001), as was a history of 
      coronary artery disease (P < 0.001), and diabetes (P=0.034). The calcification score 
      by spiral CT correlated with these same factors and the serum phosphorus and calcium 
      x phosphorus product (P=0.032 and 0.037). The location of immunostaining for the 
      bone proteins was strongly associated with the presence of calcification. However, 
      positive immunostaining also was observed in association with disorganization of the 
      vascular smooth muscle cells in the medial layer due to deposition of a matrix-like 
      substance, prior to overt calcification. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ESRD 
      undergoing renal transplantation, vascular calcification of the medial layer of the 
      inferior epigastric artery is common (44%), can be detected by spiral CT, and is 
      associated with deposition of bone matrix proteins. This implies an active 
      cell-mediated process, raising hope that directed intervention can arrest this 
      process.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure: a nine-year follow-up study.
PG  - 1175-93
AB  - Seventy-three patients with chronic renal failure who underwent parathyroidectomy 
      between March 1978 and April 1987 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients had undergone 
      sub-total parathyroidectomy, and 39 patients had undergone total parathyroidectomy 
      with parathyroid autograft into the forearm. Eight patients showed persistent 
      hyperparathyroidism requiring a second surgical procedure. In all other patients 
      there was highly statistical improvement in parathyroid hormone, total calcium, 
      ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase and a significant reduction in calcium x 
      phosphate product. Histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa was present in 21 of 22 
      patients before surgery. Postoperatively, four showed complete resolution and 
      improvement. Three patients developed histological evidence of osteomalacia during 
      the study period. Only four of the 39 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy 
      with autograft had true recurrent hyperparathyroidism and only two of the 34 
      patients who underwent sub-total parathyroidectomy had recurrent disease, indicating 
      that there is little to choose between the two techniques in the control of 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism and its subsequent recurrence. In one patient with 
      recurrence of hyperparathyroidism from a forearm parathyroid graft the histological 
      picture was different from that of normal hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Although 
      it is probable that abnormal parathyroid tissue had been implanted there was no 
      evidence of invasive growth into the forearm muscle. The most striking feature of 
      long term follow-up was the difference in calcium x phosphate product in patients in 
      whom vascular calcification increased compared to those patients with no change or 
      regression of calcification. Mean calcium phosphate product in those patients with 
      progressive vascular calcification was 4.93 for small and medium size vessels and 
      5.38 for large vessels compared to 4.10 for small and medium vessels and 4.09 for 
      large vessels. In the former case the serum phosphate was 2.00 and 2.17 as compared 
      to 1.75 or 1.73, suggesting that the aim in patients with end stage renal failure 
      maintained by dialysis should be to control the serum phosphate concentration to 1.8 
      mmol or less and the calcium x phosphate product to less than 4.2.

TI  - Association of low fetuin-A (AHSG) concentrations in serum with cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients on dialysis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 827-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is the most prominent underlying pathological 
      finding in patients with uraemia, and is a predictor of mortality in this 
      population. Fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein; AHSG) is an important 
      circulating inhibitor of calcification in vivo, and is downregulated during the 
      acute-phase response. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that AHSG deficiency is 
      directly related to uraemic vascular calcification. METHODS: We did a 
      cross-sectional study in 312 stable patients on haemodialysis to analyse the 
      inter-relation of AHSG and C-reactive protein (CRP) and their predictive effect on 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, over a period of 32 months. Subsequently, we 
      tested the capacity of serum to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation in patients on 
      long-term dialysis (n=17) with apparent soft-tissue calcifications, and in those on 
      short-term dialysis (n=8) without evidence of calcifications and cardiovascular 
      disease. FINDINGS: AHSG concentrations in serum were significantly lower in patients 
      on haemodialysis (mean 0.66 g/L [SD 0.28]) than in healthy controls (0.72 [0.19]). 
      Low concentrations of the glycoprotein were associated with raised amounts of CRP 
      and with enhanced cardiovascular (p=0.031) and all-cause mortality (p=0.0013). Sera 
      from patients on long-term dialysis with low AHSG concentrations showed impaired 
      ex-vivo capacity to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation (mean IC50: 9.0 microL serum [SD 
      3.1] vs 7.5 [0.8] in short-term patients and 6.4 [2.6] in controls). Reconstitution 
      of sera with purified AHSG returned this impairment to normal. Interpretation AHSG 
      deficiency is associated with inflammation and links vascular calcification to 
      mortality in patients on dialysis. Activated acute-phase response and AHSG 
      deficiency might account for accelerated atherosclerosis in uraemia.

TI  - Calciphylaxis leading to penile necrosis.
PG  - 711-3
AB  - Penile gangrene is a rare disease. It represents a poor prognostic sign in end stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients and an indicator of metastatic vascular calcification. 
      Pathogenesis of this life threatening condition is not clearly understood and 
      treatment is also controversial. We describe the case of a 61-year-old man known to 
      have diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure on haemodialysis, who was complaining 
      of worsening groin pain for 4 weeks. On examination dry gangrene of glans penis was 
      noted. Cultures from the penis showed multiple organisms. Computed tomography (CT) 
      showed diffuse calcification of external and internal iliac arteries. Later, he 
      developed caciphylaxis of right anterior thigh. His overall condition did not 
      improve in spite of adequate antibiotics and he was shifted to intensive care unit 
      (ICU) where he required high doses of vasopressors. Clinically he kept deteriorating 
      and passed away due to septic shock.

TI  - What is tertiary hyperparathyroidism?
PG  - 551-6
AB  - Five patients who had gross abnormalities of calcium and phosphorus metabolism due 
      to long standing renal failure are described to illustrate the difficulties with the 
      term "tertiary hyperparathyroidism". One patient who had unequivocal biochemical 
      tertiary hyperparathyroidism was found histologically to have nodular hyperplasia of 
      all four glands even though one gland weighed twice as much (12g) as the combined 
      weight of the other three. Another patient was not hypercalcaemic but had all the 
      other features of the condition including rapid onset of osteitis fibrosa, vascular 
      calcification and a probable parathyroid adenoma, with hyperplasia of the three 
      glands. The other three had hypercalcaemia only after a reduction in the plasma 
      inorganic phosphorus due either to renal transplantation or aluminum hydroxide 
      therapy. The bone histology of the five patients varied from severe osteomalacia to 
      severe osteitis fibrosa. A consideration of the factors involved in causing 
      hypercalcaemia in these patients and a review of the literature leads to the 
      conclusion that the term tertiary hyperparathyroidism is often misleading and best 
      avoided.

TI  - Visceral Adipose Tissue and Leptin Hyperproduction Are Associated With Hypogonadism 
      in Men With Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypogonadism is a common endocrine disorder in men with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), but its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We here explore the 
      plausible contribution of abdominal adiposity and leptin hyperproduction to 
      testosterone deficiency in this patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis 
      with all men included the Malnutrition, Inflammation and Vascular Calcification 
      cohort, which enrolled consecutive nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3-5. 
      SUBJECTS: A total of 172 men with CKD stages 3-5 nondialysis (median age 61 [45-75] 
      years, median glomerular filtration rate 24 [9-45] mL/min/1.73 m(2)). In them, serum 
      levels of total testosterone, estrogen, sex hormone binding globulin, and leptin 
      were quantified, together with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by thoracic and 
      abdominal CT scan. INTERVENTION: None, observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Total testosterone, hypogonadism. RESULTS: The median level of total testosterone 
      was 11.7 (7.3-18.4) nmol/L, with hypogonadism (<10 nmol/L) present in 52 (30%) 
      patients. Testosterone-deficient patients presented with significantly higher body 
      mass index, waist circumference, and VAT. An inverse correlation between 
      testosterone and VAT (rho = -0.25, P = .001) or waist circumference (rho = -0.20, 
      P = .008) was found, also after multivariate adjustment including sex hormone 
      binding globulin and estrogen. Total testosterone was inversely correlated with 
      serum leptin (rho = -0.22, P = .003), and the ratio of leptin/VAT, an index of 
      leptin hyperproduction, was strongly and independently associated with the 
      prevalence of hypogonadism in multivariable regression analyses. CONCLUSION: 
      Visceral adiposity independently associated with lower testosterone levels among men 
      with CKD stage 3-5 nondialysis. The observed link between hyperleptinemia and 
      hypogonadism is in line with previous evidence on direct effects of leptin on 
      testosterone production.

TI  - The progression and impact of vascular calcification in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 340-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been described in 
      hemodialysis patients, and severe CAC has been associated with the occurrence of 
      cardiovascular events in this population. Little information is available regarding 
      peritoneal patients. AIM: To prospectively evaluate peritoneal dialysis patients in 
      order to identify the variables associated with the rate of CAC progression, as well 
      as to determine the impact that baseline CAC has on clinical outcomes over a 1-year 
      follow-up period. METHODS: Using multislice coronary tomography, calcium scores were 
      estimated at baseline and after 12 months in 49 peritoneal dialysis patients. 
      Patients with and without CAC progression were compared with respect to clinical 
      characteristics and biochemical variables, including lipid profile, parameters of 
      mineral metabolism, and markers of inflammation. Cardiovascular events, 
      hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality were recorded. RESULTS: At baseline, 29 
      patients (59%) presented CAC and a median calcium score of 234.7 (range 10.3-2351) 
      Agatston units. Progression of CAC was observed in 13 patients (43%) who, in 
      comparison with those presenting no CAC progression, were older, presented higher 
      baseline calcium scores, and had higher mean glucose levels, lower mean high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and more months using low calcium peritoneal 
      solution. We also observed a trend toward more often presenting with a history of 
      hypertension, exhibiting more hyperphosphatemic and hyperglycemic events, and having 
      lower albumin levels. In multiple logistic regression, only baseline calcium score 
      was independently associated with progression of CAC. A shorter cardiovascular 
      event-free time and a trend toward lower survival rates were observed in the group 
      with CAC. Hospitalization event-free time did not differ between the groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Determining CAC provides important prognostic data in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients. Baseline calcium score and disturbances in glucose, mineral, and 
      lipid metabolism were indicative of higher risk of CAC progression in this 
      population.

TI  - Serum fetuin--a concentrations are inversely related to cytokine concentrations in 
      patients with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 323-7
LID - 10.1016/j.cyto.2008.08.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A close relationship exists between inflammation and vascular 
      calcification. Although fetuin-A is known to be an inhibitor of calcification, 
      studies correlating levels of this glycoprotein to markers of inflammation are 
      limited. To understand these relationships, we investigated the relationship between 
      serum fetuin-A and proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with chronic renal 
      failure (CRF). METHODS: Thirty-two patients on haemodialysis (HD), 32 conservatively 
      managed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and a control group of 25 subjects 
      with normal renal function were enrolled in this study. Serum fetuin-A, IL-1beta, 
      IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum 
      fetuin-A and IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations were investigated by the 
      Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: In 64 CRF patients (on HD and with CKD), serum 
      fetuin-A was significantly and inversely related to IL-1beta (P<0.001), IL-6 
      (P=0.025) and TNF-alpha levels (P=0.007), respectively. The serum fetuin-A levels of 
      the control subjects were not significantly correlated to levels of the inflammatory 
      markers IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha (P=0.551, 0.985 and 0.984, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: The negative correlation between serum fetuin-A and cytokine 
      concentrations in CRF patients supports the hypothesis of inflammation-dependent 
      down-regulation of fetuin-A expression.

AB  - This is a longitudinal study on 53,560 hemodialysis patients from the Japan Renal 
      Data Registry. Predictor was D[Ca] ≥3.0 vs 2.5 mEq/L. Outcomes were the first CV 
      events during 1-year observation period. Association of D[Ca] with CV events and 
      effect modifications were tested using multivariate logistic regression analyses. 
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) was a significant effect modifier for association of higher 
      D[Ca] and myocardial infarction (MI) (OR: 1.26 (1.03-1.55) among DM and 0.86 
      (0.72-1.03) among non-DM, p for interaction <0.01). The effect size was not affected 
      by further adjustment for serum albumin-corrected Ca or intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH) levels, but was attenuated by adjustment for intradialytic change in serum Ca 
      concentration (ΔCa) (1.16 [0.89-1.51]). Among DM, D[Ca] ≥3.0 mEq/L was significantly 
      associated with MI in the first tertile of corrected Ca or iPTH ≤60 pg/ml (p for 
      interaction 0.03 and 0.03, respectively). In conclusion, higher D[Ca] was associated 
      with incident MI in DM, especially with low serum Ca or iPTH levels. Attenuation of 
      the effect size by adjustment for ΔCa and stratified analyses suggest that larger Ca 
      influx during dialysis with higher D[Ca] in patients suggestive of low bone turnover 
      leads to vascular calcification and subsequent MI in DM.

      factors].
PG  - 668-77
AB  - Heart failure (CHF) and diastolic dysfuction (DD) relationship has received poor 
      attention in hemodialysis patients (HD). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence of CHF 
      in our HD patients, the relationship with DD and impact on mortality. METHODS: We 
      studied 79 patients: 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. Vascular 
      calcification (PVC) was evaluated by radiologic series (55.7%). We analyzed the 
      presence of clinical and analytical cardiovascular factors. All patients underwent 
      M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two 
      years. Clinical information collected: incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), 
      CHF, and mortality due to cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Most frequent finding was 
      Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) (93%), followed by DD (63.5% had anormal LV 
      relaxation) (ALVR). Incidence of CHF was 38.3%; and was significantly associated 
      with higher: time on HD (130/72 months), Ca x P (74/65), PTH (677/376), bone 
      alkaline phosphatase (27/16), and systolic BP (145 vs 130 mmHg); IHD, PVC, valvular 
      calcification (VC), LVH and ALVR (p < 0.01). Systolic function was normal in both 
      groups (with/without CHF). Logistic regression identified as risk factors for CHF: 
      ALVR (OR: 9.5), IHD (OR: 15) and systolic BP (OR: 2.2). ALVR was associated with 
      greater age (55/37), longer time on HD (76/60), PVC and VC (p < 0.001). Predictor 
      factors identified were age (OR: 2.13) and PVC (OR: 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: HD patients 
      showed a high incidence of CHF. IHD, systolic BP and DD (ALVR) have behave as risk 
      factors for CHF. Vascular calcifications were intimately related to these findings 
      and, therefore, they contribute to the greater mortality of these patients.

TI  - [Vascular calcification after kidney transplantation. Preliminary results].
PG  - 11-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VC) are a common feature in chronic dialysis 
      patients, but their clinical significance is debated, and the role of kidney 
      transplantation (TRP) in the natural history of their development has received only 
      scanty attention. METHODS: In our study we reviewed skeletal surveys as well as 
      clinical and biochemical records of 13 patients who started again chronic dialysis 
      at our Centre after failure of their kidney grafts. Changes of VC (during TRP) were 
      scored as: 1 = no substantial progression (4 patients), 2 = moderate worsening (4 
      patients), 3 = severe worsening (5 patients = 38.4%). RESULTS: The most interesting 
      association with the clinical/biochemical parameters seems to be between the score 3 
      subgroup and highest Ca*P values and vitamin D therapy. Four out of five score 3 
      patients experienced overt vascular events and 4 out of 5 of the same subgroup 
      experienced parathyroidectomy (PTX) before, during or after the TRP. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      this preliminary study we can conclude that a) the possibility of dramatic worsening 
      of VC during TRP is not a rare event and this feature has a strong clinical 
      implication, b) PTX before TRP could remove at least one of the putative risk 
      factors in patients waiting for TRP with suboptimal control with medical therapy.

TI  - Inflammation and coronary calcification in renal patients--factors that may explain 
      increased cardiovascular risk, and poorer results of coronary interventions?
PG  - 118-24
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of mortality in patients 
      with renal diseases, with increased odds ratio of mortality with risk factors as 
      diverse as cholesterol, vascular stiffness, chronic inflammation and 
      hyperhomocysteinemia. Several factors have been incriminated to explain the increase 
      in coronary vascular calcification (CVC) in this particular population. Increased 
      duration of dialysis, dyslipidemia, altered calcium-phosphorus metabolism, and 
      chronic inflammation have all been associated with increased CVC. We present here 
      four case reports illustrating the differences in the pathophysiology, therapy and 
      prognosis of calcific coronary heart disease seen in uremic patients.

TI  - Progression of coronary artery calcification and thoracic aorta calcification in 
      kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - 258-69
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease, 
      the major cause of death in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Longitudinal 
      studies of vascular calcification in KTRs are few and small and have short 
      follow-up. We assessed the evolution of coronary artery (CAC) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification and their determinants in a cohort of prevalent KTRs. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Longitudinal. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The Agatston score of coronary arteries and 
      thoracic aorta was measured by 16-slice spiral computed tomography in 281 KTRs. 
      PREDICTORS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were recorded 
      simultaneously. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The Agatston score was measured again 3.5 
      or more years later. RESULTS: Repeated analyzable computed tomographic scans were 
      available for 197 (70%) KTRs after 4.40 ± 0.28 years; they were not available for 
      the rest of patients because of death (n = 40), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), other 
      arrhythmias (n = 4), refusal (n = 35), or technical problems precluding confident 
      calcium scoring (n = 4). CAC and aorta calcification scores increased significantly 
      (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during follow-up. By 
      multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history of 
      cardiovascular event, use of a statin, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level were 
      independent determinants of CAC progression. Independent determinants of aorta 
      calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score, higher 
      pulse pressure, use of a statin, older age, higher serum phosphate level, use of 
      aspirin, and male sex. Significant regression of CAC or aorta calcification was not 
      observed in this cohort. LIMITATIONS: Cohort of prevalent KTRs with potential 
      survival bias; few patients with diabetes and nonwhites, limiting the 
      generalizability of results. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous small short-term 
      studies, we show that vascular calcification progression is substantial within 4 
      years in prevalent KTRs and is associated with several traditional and 
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors, some of which are modifiable.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and risks of acute kidney injury, end-stage renal disease, and 
      mortality in hospitalized patients.
PG  - 362
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1556-y [doi]
LID - 362
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphatemia is associated with vascular calcification and bone 
      mineral disorders and is a major concern among patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). However, the relationship between hyperphosphatemia and renal outcome in 
      non-CKD patients has not been studied. Furthermore, the clinical implications of 
      hyperphosphatemia in relation to the risks of acute kidney injury (AKI), end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD), and mortality after hospitalization remain unresolved. 
      METHODS: A total of 20,686 patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to Seoul National 
      University Bundang Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013 were retrospectively 
      reviewed. Patients were divided into quartiles according to serum phosphorus level 
      at the time of admission. The odds ratios (ORs) for AKI and hazard ratios (HRs) for 
      ESRD and all-cause mortality were calculated after adjustment of multiple 
      covariates. RESULTS: AKI developed in 2319 patients (11.2%), with higher ORs for 
      patients in the third and fourth quartiles (1.4 [1.24-1.68] and 2.8 [2.44-3.22], 
      respectively) compared with the first quartile group. During a median follow-up 
      period of 4.0 years, 183 patients (0.88%) developed ESRD and 3675 patients (17.8%) 
      died. Patients in the fourth quartile had higher risks of ESRD and mortality than 
      patients in the first quartile (HRs, 2.3 [1.46-3.75] and 1.4 [1.22-1.49], 
      respectively). These trends remained consistent in patients with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperphosphatemia is 
      related to the risks of AKI, ESRD, and mortality, and it may therefore be necessary 
      to monitor serum phosphorus level in hospitalized patients, irrespective of kidney 
      function.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether low serum levels of 
      fetuin-A are potential biochemical predictor of early and/or late survival in 
      chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured serum levels of 
      fetuin-A in 67 patients on chronic HD, and correlated it to 3, 12, and 24 months 
      mortality. RESULTS: Cumulative death rate was 7%, 19%, and 37% deaths at 3, 12, and 
      24 months. Serum fetuin-A was significantly lower in 3 months and 12 months 
      non-survivals (p<0.001), but not in 24 months non-survivals. Kaplan-Meier analyses 
      based on fetuin-A tertiles showed statistically significantly increased probability 
      of death up to 12 months of follow-up for decreasing fetuin-A concentrations 
      (p<0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin-A as a circulating inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification was significant predictor of early mortality in chronic HD patients 
      but did not appear as a fair marker for later survival.

TI  - Histological, radiological, and biochemical features of the adynamic bone lesion in 
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 19-29
AB  - Adynamic bone is being found with increasing frequency in dialysis patients. Little 
      is known about its aetiology, and even less about its natural history. We found 10 
      cases of asymptomatic adynamic bone among a group of 32 continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis patients, most of whom had never been exposed to 
      aluminium-containing phosphate binders. Compared to the remaining 22 patients, they 
      had an older mean age (54 +/- 11.4 vs. 42 +/- 11.8 years; p < 0.05), probably a 
      longer pre-dialysis duration of renal failure (10.9 vs. 7.1 years), higher mean 
      ionized calcium (1.30 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; p < 0.01), and lower mean 
      intact parathyroid hormone (31.5 vs. 200.3 pg/ml; p < 0.001). The bone density was 
      not different between the two groups, but 9 of the 10 adynamic patients had 
      significant vascular calcification seen on plain radiology as compared with only 7 
      of 20 in the comparison group (p < 0.05). Follow-up of the adynamic patients showed 
      a close association with serum intact parathyroid hormone and ionized calcium 
      levels. With one exception, adynamic bone did not appear to be associated with lower 
      bone density than other types of osteodystrophy, but a longer-term study is required 
      to determine the complete natural history of this lesion.

PG  - 323-6

AB  - During hemodialysis, the development of hypotension or symptoms suggestive of 
      ischemia is used as a surrogate marker for the establishment of dry weight. These 
      symptoms manifest commonly as muscle cramps, chest pain or abdominal pain. 
      Hemodialysis patients are also prone to vascular calcification which may be medial 
      or intimal. We report the case of a 68-year-old male who developed testicular pain 
      while attempting to establish dry weight. Computerized tomography scan of his 
      abdomen showed extensive vascular calcification. The end result in this case was 
      bilateral orchiectomy. Histopathology revealed hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis with 
      intimal calcification contributing to ischemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease--mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are 
      associated with vascular calcification and abnormal electrolytes that lead to 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. CKD-MBD is identified by imbalances in serum 
      calcium (Ca), phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although the relation of 
      phosphate and PTH with the prognosis of HF patients has been reported, the 
      association of Ca with prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and CKD remains 
      unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 191 patients admitted for HF and CKD 
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)), and they were 
      divided into 2 groups based on levels of corrected Ca: low Ca (Ca <8.4 mg/dL; n = 
      32) and normal-high Ca (8.4 ≤Ca; n = 159). We compared laboratory and 
      echocardiographic findings, as well as followed cardiac and all-cause mortality. The 
      low-Ca group had 1) higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (308.9 vs. 261.0 U/L; P = 
      .026), 2) lower levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (26.1 vs. 45.0 pg/mL; P = .011) 
      and hydrogen carbonate (22.4 vs. 24.5 mmol/L; P = .031), and 3) a tendency to have a 
      higher PTH level (87.5 vs. 58.6 pg/mL; P = .084). In contrast, left and right 
      ventricular systolic function, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein, 
      phosphate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and zinc did not differ between the 2 
      groups. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, cardiac and all-cause mortality were 
      significantly higher in the low-Ca group than in the normal-high-Ca group (P < .05). 
      In the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, hypocalcemia was an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD patients (P < .05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypocalcemia was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF 
      and CKD patients.

TI  - Bone mineral density in children with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - Bone mineral density (BMD) is important in children and adolescents because of its 
      relationship to long-term skeletal health, and because, in adults with chronic renal 
      failure (CRF), a relationship between low BMD and vascular calcification has been 
      suggested. To investigate the relationship between BMD and manipulable factors that 
      might affect it, i.e. plasma calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH), 64 
      patients with a median glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 31 (range 7-60) ml 
      min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) and median age of 10.0 (4.1-16.9) years were followed over 1.3 
      (0.7-1.7) years at an average of 5 (3-14) clinic visits. At one visit, BMD of the 
      lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The mean BMD Z-score 
      was normal (=0.0). Overall mean calcium, phosphate and PTH levels were in their 
      respective normal ranges. The majority of the patients (72%) were treated with 
      calcium carbonate, mean dose 65 mg kg(-1) day(-1); prescription was positively 
      related to serum calcium levels and calcium-phosphate product (P=0.012 and P<0.01 
      respectively). Almost all patients (98%) were treated with alfacalcidol, mean dose 
      12 ng kg(-1) day(-1); prescription was not related to investigated factors. Patients 
      grew well; there was no change in height standard deviation score (DeltaHtSDS=0.0). 
      Normal BMD Z-score for age and sex can be achieved in children with CRF managed with 
      the aim of maintaining normal PTH levels by dietary phosphate restriction, 
      calcium-based phosphate binders and small doses of alfacalcidol. Further 
      investigation of the underlying bone by the use of biopsy and histomorphometry is 
      required to determine actual bone health.

AB  - Sclerostin is a marker of low-turnover bone disease in end stage renal disease 
      patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum sclerostin in uremic patients, 
      analyzing its behavior during a single hemodialysis session. Twenty-one adult 
      patients on intermittent hemodialysis treatment were enrolled. Acetate Free 
      Bio-filtration (AFB) was the technique employed. Uremic patients were characterized 
      by higher levels of serum sclerostin when compared with values observed in healthy 
      subjects. Sclerostin assessed in pre-dialysis samples was 1.4 ± 1.02 ng/mL, whereas, 
      in post dialysis samples, a reduction of sclerostin values was observed 
      (0.8 ± 0.6 ng/mL; p: 0.008). Sclerostin correlated with parameters of dialysis 
      adequacy, such as creatinine levels and Kt/V values, and it was significantly 
      associated with atherosclerotic disease. Receiver operating characteristics analysis 
      revealed a good diagnostic profile in identifying atherosclerotic disease. 
      Sclerostin, a full dialyzable substance during AFB dialysis, is closely associated 
      with atherosclerotic disease. Its reduction obtained through AFB could represent a 
      defensive mechanism, improving vascular disease and renal osteodystrophy.

TI  - Bone morphogenetic protein-2 may represent the molecular link between oxidative 
      stress and vascular stiffness in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 418-23
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2010.04.023 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress and vascular calcifications are emergent risk factors for the 
      accelerated atherosclerosis process featuring chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular 
      calcification is an active process similar to bone modelling, where BMP-2 may play a 
      pathogenic role. Aim of our study was to investigate the link between oxidative 
      stress, BMP-2 protein expression and vascular disease in CKD. We enrolled 85 CKD 
      patients (K-DOQI stage II or higher) and 41 healthy individuals. 
      8-Oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was used as a marker of oxidative 
      stress. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was used as a measure of arterial 
      stiffness. BMP-2 serum levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in 
      controls (p<0.0001). Serum 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in CKD patients 
      compared to controls (p<0.05). BMP-2 serum levels were inversely associated with 
      eGFR (r=-0.3; p=0.01) and directly correlated with 8-OHdG serum concentrations 
      (r=-0.3; p=0.03). Arterial stiffness was inversely correlated with eGFR (r=-0.4; 
      p=0.001) and directly correlated with BMP-2 (r=0.3; p=0.03), 8-OHdG (r=0.4, p=0.02) 
      and phosphorus serum levels (r=0.3; p=0.007). In a multiple regression model, 
      phosphorus and BMP-2 were independently correlated with baPWV. In vitro exposure to 
      H(2)O(2) induced a time and dose-dependent increase in BMP-2 expression in an 
      immortalized endothelial cell line. Moreover, H(2)O(2) pre-incubation of cultured 
      vascular smooth muscle cell enhanced the BMP-2-induced up-regulation of ALPL, an 
      osteoblastic phenotype marker. Our data suggest that in CKD BMP-2 may represent the 
      molecular link between oxidative stress and arterial stiffness due to vascular 
      calcification.

TI  - Coronary artery and other vascular calcifications in patients with cystinosis after 
      kidney transplantation.
PG  - 555-62
AB  - Cystinosis, an autosomal recessive disorder of lysosomal cystine accumulation, 
      results from mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes the lysosomal cystine 
      transporter, cystinosin. Renal tubular Fanconi syndrome occurs in infancy, followed 
      by rickets, growth retardation, photophobia, and renal failure, which requires renal 
      transplantation at approximately 10 yr of age. Treatment with cysteamine decreases 
      cellular cystine levels, retards renal deterioration, and allows for normal growth. 
      Patients with a history of inadequate cystine depletion therapy may survive, after 
      renal transplantation, into the third to fifth decades but will experience other, 
      extrarenal complications of the disease. Routine chest and head computed tomography 
      scans of 41 posttransplantation patients with cystinosis were reviewed for vascular 
      calcification. The radiologic procedures had been performed to examine lung and 
      brain parenchyma, so there was little ascertainment bias. Thirteen of the 41 
      patients had vascular calcification, including 11 with coronary artery 
      calcification. One 25-yr-old man required three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft 
      surgery. There were no significant differences between the 13 patients with 
      calcification and the 28 without calcification in the following parameters: Time on 
      dialysis, frequency of transplantation, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
      homozygosity for the 57-kb deletion in CTNS, serum creatinine, and calcium-phosphate 
      product. However, the finding of vascular calcification correlated directly with 
      duration of life without cysteamine therapy and inversely with duration of life 
      under good cystine-depleting therapy. The accumulation of intracellular cystine 
      itself maybe a risk factor for vascular calcifications, and older patients with 
      cystinosis should be screened for this complication.

TI  - Association between very low PTH levels and poor survival rates in haemodialysis 
      patients: results from the French ARNOS cohort.
PG  - c211-6
LID - 10.1159/000321642 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated with 
      an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and mortality in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency, the 
      associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent 
      HD patients. METHODS: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the 
      French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the 
      Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 
      1) and ≥ 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis was 
      performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded. 
      RESULTS: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 
      (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels 
      (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 
      1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 
      0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 
      0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds 
      ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and 
      serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any 
      PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet 
      (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥ 1.5 mmol/l (94%)). CONCLUSION: In this 
      observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and 
      was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be 
      responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic 
      bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing 
      vascular calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using 
      fewer PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor 
      prognosis.

TI  - Progression of aortic arch calcification and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 187-94
LID - 10.1007/s11255-009-9574-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is reported as a predictor for 
      cardiovascular mortality in the general population, it is unknown whether this is 
      also true in hemodialysis (HD) patients in whom vascular calcification and 
      cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects 
      were 401 patients (270 men and 131 women) on chronic HD therapy. Calcification of 
      the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a score (AoACS) on plain chest 
      radiography. Survival curves were estimated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method and 
      evaluated using the log-rank test. RESULTS: AoAC was present in 203 patients 
      (50.6%). During a follow-up period of 4.0 years, there were 72 all-cause deaths, of 
      which 41 were from cardiovascular diseases. Of patients with and without AoAC, 15.2 
      and 20.7% died, respectively (11.3 and 6.6% of cardiovascular diseases, 
      respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that cardiovascular mortality was 
      significantly greater in patients with AoAC compared to those without (P = 0.0396, 
      log-rank test). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis found that the 
      presence of AoAC was significantly associated with increased cardiovascular 
      mortality (hazard ratio, 2.556; 95% confidence interval, 1.006-6.490; P < 0.05) 
      after adjustment for age, presence of diabetes, body mass index, diastolic blood 
      pressure, and serum albumin level. CONCLUSION: The presence of AoAC is significantly 
      associated with cardiovascular mortality in HD patients, suggesting that careful 
      attention should be given to the presence of AoAC in a plain chest radiograph as a 
      prognostic indicator.

TI  - Relationship between vascular calcification, arterial stiffness and bone mineral 
      density in a cross-sectional study of prevalent Australian haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 105-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1797.2008.01056.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is associated with increased 
      vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness, both inversely correlated with 
      bone mineral density (BMD). Few studies have correlated VC in the dialysis 
      population with measurements of BMD and arterial compliance. METHODS: We report 
      cross-sectional data on 45 haemodialysis (HD) patients assessing the prevalence of 
      VC and its associations. Patients had computed tomography scans through abdominal 
      aorta and superficial femoral arteries (SFA) to determine VC, pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV) using SphygmoCor device measuring arterial stiffness, and dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA) to determine BMD. RESULTS: Patients, 64% male, 38% diabetic, 
      had median age 58 years. Mean PWV was 8.7 +/- 3.5 m/s and median aortic VC score 
      488.1 +/- 298 Hounsfield units, with 91% having aortic VC present. In univariate 
      linear regression analysis, aortic VC correlated positively with length of HD (P = 
      0.03) and diabetes (P = 0.06). Increasing PWV was positively associated with age (P 
      = 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.05) and VC (aortic P = 0.08, SFA P = 0.01). In 
      multivariate regression analysis, length of HD and diabetes were significantly 
      associated with aortic VC, whereas age and diabetes were associated with SFA VC and 
      PWV. Mean lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores on DXA were 0.14 and -1.66 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Increased VC and reduced arterial compliance, both closely 
      related, are common in Australian HD patients. Both are associated with diabetes and 
      increasing age, and greater aortic VC is seen with longer duration of dialysis.

TI  - Noninvasive Blood Pressure Measurement in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients: 
      Comparison of Agreement between Oscillometric and Finger-Cuff Methods.
PG  - 309-317
LID - 10.1159/000457812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Nexfin monitor is a device used for measuring arterial blood 
      pressure (BP) continuously and noninvasively through finger-cuff technology. Since 
      it was validated against the auscultatory method using a sphygmomanometer, the aim 
      of this study was to test the ability of the Nexfin to evaluate brachial arterial 
      pressure (BAP) in maintenance hemodialysis patients, quantifying accuracy and 
      precision. METHODS: Forty hemodynamically stable hemodialysis patients underwent 
      serial measurements of Nexfix arterial pressure (NAP) and BAP, respectively, through 
      Nexfin and oscillometric devices. All BP measurements were recorded before starting 
      hemodialysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 68.9 ± 14.9 years with 65% 
      older than 65 years and 30% older than 75; eleven subjects (27%) were diabetic. 
      Vascular calcification, evaluated from the aortic arch to the iliac bifurcation, was 
      detected in 87.5% of patients. Bland-Altman analysis comparing NAP measurements with 
      BAP revealed the following outcomes: a mean bias ± limits of agreements (LA) of 15.3 
      ± 34.8 mm Hg (29% error) for systolic BP, a mean bias ± LA of -0.9 ± 20.34 mm Hg 
      (32% error) for diastolic BP and a mean bias ± LA of 4.5 ± 21.34 mm Hg (26% error) 
      for mean arterial pressure (MAP). Nexfin had poor precision in the reconstruction of 
      diastolic and mean BP and was extremely inaccurate when evaluating systolic BP. 
      Diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and increase in systolic BAP significantly 
      predicted the disagreement in systolic pressure measurement between NAP and MAP, F 
      (3.34) = 10.787, p < 0.005, R2 = 0.488. CONCLUSION: The Nexfin does not meet the 
      criteria of interchangeability with oscillometric method in our hemodialysis 
      patients. The negative influence of diabetes, neuropathy, and increase of systolic 
      BAP on the reconstruction of systemic systolic pressure raises concerns about the 
      feasibility of Nexfin in patients with a high prevalence of vasculopathy.

TI  - Effect of sevelamer on aortic pulse wave velocity in patients on hemodialysis: a 
      prospective observational study.
PG  - S13-21
AB  - Aortic stiffening and aortic calcification are risk factors for cardiovascular 
      events in hemodialysis (HD) patients, and these 2 risk factors are interrelated. 
      Sevelamer decreases aortic calcification but its effect on aortic stiffness has not 
      been investigated previously. Thirteen HD patients commencing sevelamer treatment 
      and 13 matched controls were followed for 11 months. Aortic pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), and levels of inhibitors of vascular calcification 
      (fetuin-A, matrix-GLA-protein, osteoprotegerin/RANKL) were measured at baseline and 
      at the end of follow-up, and the differences between the groups were compared. 
      Determinants of the changes in PWV during follow-up were assessed by multivariate 
      linear regression. At baseline, PWV was 9.93 (2.10) m/s in sevelamer-treated 
      patients and 9.20 (2.84) m/s in control patients (p=0.464). By the end of follow-up, 
      PWV decreased by 0.83 (2.3) m/s in sevelamer-treated patients while it increased by 
      0.93 (1.88) m/s in controls (p=0.042). The direction of changes in AIx were similar, 
      but not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the 
      levels of inhibitors of calcification either at baseline or during follow-up. In 
      multivariate linear regression sevelamer treatment, diabetes, heart rate, and 
      C-reactive protein were related to the change in PWV. These data suggest that 
      sevelamer treatment is associated with an improvement in aortic stiffness in HD 
      patients, but it does not seem to affect serum levels of inhibitors of vascular 
      calcification.

AB  - AIM: Vascular access is the lifeline of haemodialysis patients and radial-cephalic 
      fistula is the preferred type of access. We investigated vascular calcification in 
      uraemia radial arteries and compared it with clinical parameters. METHODS: Artery 
      specimens from 30 end-stage renal disease patients were collected, examined 
      calcification by von Kossa and Alizarin red staining. Expression of alpha-smooth 
      muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and the main component of bone matrix, osteopontin (OP) 
      were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In uraemia vessels, calcification 
      was mainly located in the medial layer. Nineteen (63.33%) patients had no evidence 
      of calcification, six (20%) had mild/moderate calcification and five (16.66%) had 
      severe calcification. Upregulation of OP and diminished expression of alpha-SMA 
      occurred in the medial layer, especially in the area of severe calcification. The 
      calcification score, decreased expression of alpha-SMA and upregulation of OP were 
      positively correlated with older age, serum calcium, serum phosphorus and calcium x 
      phosphorus product (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcification in uraemia radial 
      arteries is mainly located in the media layer. The risk factors appear to be older 
      age, an elevated serum level of phosphorus, calcium and calcium x phosphorus 
      product.

PG  - 519-26
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased 
      mortality risk in the general population. Although individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) are at markedly increased mortality risk, the incidence, prevalence, 
      and prognosis of CAC in CKD are not well understood. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 1,908 participants who 
      underwent coronary calcium scanning as part of the multiethnic CRIC (Chronic Renal 
      Insufficiency Cohort) Study. PREDICTOR: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      computed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, 
      stratified by race, sex, and diabetic status. eGFR was treated as a continuous and a 
      categorical variable compared with the reference value of >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). 
      MEASUREMENTS: CAC detected using computed tomography (CT) using either an Imatron 
      C-300 electron beam computed tomography (CT) scanner or multidetector CT scanner. 
      CAC was computed using Agatston score as a categorical variable. Analyses were 
      performed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We found a strong and graded 
      relationship between lower eGFR and increasing CAC. In unadjusted models, ORs 
      increased from 1.68 (95% CI, 1.23-2.31) for eGFR of 50-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 2.82 
      (95% CI, 2.06-3.85) for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable adjustment only 
      partially attenuated the results (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.20) for eGFR <30 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2). LIMITATIONS: Use of eGFR rather than measured GFR. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      showed a graded relationship between severity of CKD and CAC independent of 
      traditional risk factors. These findings support recent guidelines that state that 
      if vascular calcification is present, it should be considered as a complementary 
      component to be included in the decision making required for individualizing CKD 
      treatment.

TI  - Influence of peritoneal dialysis solution biocompatibility on long-term survival of 
      patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and the technique itself.
PG  - 352-62
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Morbidity and mortality of continous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis 
      (CAPD) patients is still very high. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects 
      of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions (standard vs biocompatible) on long-term 
      patients' and the techique survival. METHODS: A total of 42 stable patients on CAPD 
      participated in this cross-sectional study. They were prospectively followed-up 
      during the twelve years. Patients with severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/L) and malignant 
      disease ware excluded. Twenty one (50%/0) patients were treated with the standard PD 
      solutions (CAPDP-1) while the other 21 (500/0) were treated with biocompatible PD 
      solutions [(lower level of glucose degradation products, lower concentration of 
      Ca(2+) and neutral pH (CAPDP-2)]. All patients were analyzed for a presence of 
      vascular calcification, nutrition status, and parameters of inflammation after 2.5 
      +/- 0.6 years of starting CAPD, and these variables considered in the analysis as 
      risk factors. RESULTS: The patients from the group CAPDP-2 compared to those from 
      the group CAPDP-1 had lower level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p 
      = 0.003), and better nutritional status as confirmed by the mid-arm circumference (p 
      = 0.015), and mid-arm muscle circumference (p = 0.002) and subjective global 
      assessment (p = 0.000). Also, they had lower vascular calcifications as confirmed by 
      intima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.003), degree of carotid narrowing (p = 0.001) 
      and calcified plaques of common carotid arteries (CCA) (p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis confirmed better survival of patients from the group CAPDP-2 than those 
      from the group CAPDP-1 (1-, 5-, and 10-year patients survival rate was: 100%, 61.9% 
      and 14.3% for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 52.4% for the group CAPDP-2, 
      respectively; p = 0.0345). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year technique survival rate was: 
      100%, 71.4%, and 38.1% for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 76.2% for the 
      group CAPDP-2, respectively; (p = 0.0719). Duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride 
      and cardiovascular score (quantitative scoring system consisting of: ejection 
      fraction (EF) of left ventricle < 50%; IMT > 1 mm; carotid narrowing degree > 50%, 
      presence of carotid plaques in both common carotide, ischaemic heart disease, 
      cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease with or without amputation) 
      were independent predictors of overall patient survival. Duration of dialysis was 
      only independent predictor of overall technique survival. CONCLUSION: Although 
      patients treated with biocompatible solutions showed significantly better survival, 
      the role of biocompatibility of CAPD solutions in patients and technique survival 
      have to be confirmed. Namely, multivariate analysis confirmed that duration of 
      dialysis, serum triglyceride and cardiovascular score significantly predicted 
      overall CAPD patients survival, while only duration of dialysis was found to be 
      independent predictor of overall techique survival.

TI  - Association of pelvic arterial calcification with arteriovenous thigh graft failure 
      in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2564-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal of 
      the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are 
      associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 
      54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular 
      access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the 
      abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes 
      unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the 
      graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common 
      iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 5-point 
      scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to complete the 
      anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed. RESULTS: There was a 
      high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular calcification (kappa = 0.801). 
      Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on 
      CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six 
      patients (50%) with moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft 
      failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was 
      lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two 
      groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum 
      calcium, serum phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSION: There is a 
      strong association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of 
      thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is 
      predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.

TI  - Association of glycated albumin, but not glycated hemoglobin, with peripheral 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 516-9
LID - 10.1016/j.lfs.2008.08.001 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Elevated HbA(1C) is a predictor of mortality as well as peripheral vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients with diabetes. However, improved 
      glycemic control as reflected by reduction in HbA(1C) may dismiss the relationship 
      between HbA(1C) and mortality in those patients, due possibly to the underestimation 
      of HbA(1C) by erythropoietin use. This study was to establish the significance of 
      glycated albumin (GA) as a useful marker of peripheral vascular calcification in 
      diabetic HD patients, in comparison with HbA(1C). MAIN METHODS: We examined 49 HD 
      patients with type 2 diabetes (37 men and 12 women). Peripheral vascular 
      calcification at hand arteries was checked on a simple X-ray photograph. GA and 
      HbA(1C) were determined just before HD session. KEY FINDINGS: The prevalence of 
      peripheral vascular calcification was significantly higher in diabetic patients 
      (65.3%) than in non-diabetic patients (27.0%). Multiple regression analyses in 
      diabetic patients showed that both HD duration and GA were significantly associated 
      with the presence of peripheral vascular calcification. When GA was replaced by 
      HbA(1C) in the same model, HbA(1C) failed to show a significant association. 
      However, when a weekly dose of erythropoietin was simultaneously included in 
      addition to HD duration and HbA(1C), both HbA(1C) as well as HD duration emerged as 
      a significant factor associated with the presence of peripheral vascular 
      calcification. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study suggested that GA might be a better 
      indicator of glycemic control, and raise the possibility that improvement of 
      glycemic control might prevent against the development of peripheral vascular 
      calcification in diabetic HD patients.

TI  - Infective endocarditis in chronic hemodialysis patients: experience from Morocco.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - Since the 1960s, regular hemodialysis (HD) was recognized as a risk factor for the 
      development of infective endocarditis (IE), particularly at vascular access sites. 
      The present report describes our experience at the Etat Major General Agadir, 
      Morocco, of taking care of IE in patients on regular dialysis. A retrospective 
      analysis was made of five cases of IE in patients receiving regular HD having 
      arteriovenous fistula as vascular access. They were sent from four private centers 
      and admitted in our formation between January 2004 and March 2009. Infective 
      endocarditis was detected after 34.5 months following initiation of dialysis. The 
      causative organisms included Staphylococcus and Enterococcus in two cases each and 
      negative blood culture in one case. A recent history of infection (<3 months) of the 
      vascular access was found in three cases. Peripheric embolic phenomena were noted in 
      two cases. A pre-existing heart disease was common and contributed to heart failure. 
      Mortality was frequent due to valvular perforations and congestive heart failure, 
      making the medical treatment alone unsatisfactory. Two patients survived and three 
      of our patients received a prosthetic valve replacement, with a median survival 
      after surgery of 10.3 months/person. The clinical diagnosis of infective 
      endocarditis in regularly dialyzed patients remains difficult, with the presence of 
      vascular calcification as a common risk factor. The vascular catheter infections are 
      the cardinal gateway of pathogenic organisms, which are mainly Staphylococcus. The 
      prognosis is bad and the mortality is significant, whereas medical and surgical 
      treatments are often established in these patients who have many factors of 
      comorbidity.

TI  - Risk factors for progression of aortic arch calcification in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 460-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2011.00571.x [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an 
      important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using plain 
      chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC 
      progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 
      59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography 
      before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then divided 
      the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of AoAC progression. 
      We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical profiles in the two groups. 
      Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age, 58.6 ± 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients 
      (41.3%) had AoAC before initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 ± 20.4%. The 
      mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 ± 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had 
      progressive AoAC. Age >65 years (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes 
      (p = 0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC 
      progression. No significant association was found between AoAC progression and the 
      baseline clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis 
      modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the presence 
      of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC progression 
      in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the presence of AoAC 
      before initial dialysis were significantly related to the progression of AoAC in 
      these patients. The results suggest that patients should be carefully managed from 
      the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular 
      morbidity.

TI  - [Efficiency of total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation in 31 patients with 
      uremic hyperparathyroidism].
PG  - 714-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy of total parathyroidectomy with 
      autotransplantation (total PTX + AT) in treating uremic secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism and to discuss the relevant medical treatment used. METHODS: The 
      clinical data of 31 patients with uremic SHPT admitted into our hospital from 
      1996-2005 were analysed with respect to total PTX + AT. RESULTS: The period of 
      hemodialysis were for the patients was on the average 9.2 years. There were 22 male 
      and 9 female with an average age of 42.4 (31 - 67) years. The clinical 
      manifestations consisted of osteoarticular pain in 83.9%, fractures in 35.5%, soft 
      tissue and vascular calcification in 45.2% and pruritus in 80.6%. Laboratory 
      examination yielded the following results: haematocrit 0.25 +/- 0.04, serum Ca (2.61 
      +/- 0.35) mmol/L, serum P (2.14 +/- 0.31) mmol/L, plasma total alkaline phosphatase 
      (AKP) (885 +/- 335) U/L and parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (1811 +/- 879) ng/L (700 - 
      2500 ng/L). Cervical ultrasonography and/or emission computed tomography showed 2 - 
      4 hyperplastic glands. All of the patients showed no response to medical treatment 
      including vitamin D. Total PTX + AT was performed on the 31 cases. Clinical symptoms 
      and signs markedly improved after operation in 1 to 2 weeks. However, fracture and 
      ectopic calcification showed no improvement. Plasma iPTH decreased rapidly (< 200 
      ng/L) postoperatively in 1 to 2 days. Serum Ca and P returned to normal. AKP was 
      corrected in 1 to 3 months. CONCLUSION: Total parathyroidectomy with 
      autotransplantation is an effective treatment for severe uremic secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism patients.

TI  - Progressive vascular calcification over 2 years is associated with arterial 
      stiffening and increased mortality in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1241-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an 
      important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
      cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
      calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 
      134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial 
      femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave 
      velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
      baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. 
      Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients 
      with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The 
      hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who 
      were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
      calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta 
      blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated 
      with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 
      patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in 
      calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk 
      factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease 
      and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification 
      over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness 
      and mortality.

TI  - High-dose calcitriol therapy and progression of cardiac vascular calcifications.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients show a very high prevalence of cardiovascular 
      complications, affected as they are with abnormal and accelerated vascular 
      calcifications and, eventually, calcium and phosphorous metabolism disorders. 
      Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) provides a reproducible, high-resolution 
      imaging of calcium contained in cardiac arteries, measured by Agatston score. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of high-dose and low-dose 
      calcitriol therapy on the progression of cardiac vascular calcifications in dialyzed 
      patients. METHODS: We enrolled 36 dialyzed patients in a prospective study, 
      including an interventional period of 12 months and a follow-up period of 12 months. 
      Eighteen protocol patients received intravenous pulses of high-doses calcitriol at 
      the end of dialytic treatment and sevelamer hydrochloride therapy. Control patients 
      received low-dose calcitriol and sevelamer hydrochloride as well. Two MSCT scans 
      were performed: 1 at the start of the study and 1 at the end of follow-up, and 
      Agatston score was calculated at both examinations. RESULTS: At first examination, 
      protocol patients showed almost the same level of cardiac vascular calcification as 
      control patients. At the second MSCT, statistically significantly higher values of 
      Agatston score were recorded for all patients. Indeed, patients who showed higher 
      baseline values developed worse calcifications as recorded at the end of follow-up, 
      both in the protocol and control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that baseline 
      level is strongly predictive of vascular calcification progression, and, moreover, 
      there is no association between calcitriol administered doses and the progression of 
      cardiac vascular calcification.

TI  - Treatment of persistent hyperparathyroidism in renal transplant patients with 
      cinacalcet improves control of blood pressure.
PG  - 2385-7
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.167 [doi]
AB  - Persistent hyperparathyroidism is observed in 17% to 50% of patients at 1 year after 
      renal transplantation. In 10% of these patients, hypercalcemia is also present. This 
      condition increases the risk of vascular calcification, correlating with inferior 
      graft function among patients with interstitial calcification in the renal 
      allograft. Hypertension is appears in 60% to 90% of patients after transplantation, 
      favoring progressive graft dysfunction. Hypercalcemia per se causes hypertension. 
      Parathyroid hormone can potentiate the pressor effects of hypercalcemia. Fourteen 
      renal transplant recipients were included based upon: total serum calcium > 10.0 
      mg/dL, intact parathyroid hormone levels > 70 pg/mL, graft function > 6 months, 
      creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min, and stable immunosuppressive therapy. We also 
      examined blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment. Initially patients received 
      30 mg of cinacalcet once a day. The follow-up was up to 6 months. The mean 
      cinacalcet dose was 40 mg/24 h. Five patients received 60 mg/24 h. Both serum 
      calcium and iPTH decreased significantly from 10.6 (DE 0.4) to 9.8 (DE Both serum 
      calcium and iPTH decreased significantly from 10.6 (DE 0.4)to 9.8 (DE 0.6) mg/dL (P 
      < .001) and from 195.0 (DE 140.0) to 118.62 (DE 102.2; P < .0001). There were no 
      significant changes in renal function, proteinuria, or tacrolimus levels. Mean blood 
      pressure diminished from 94.1 (DE 12.0) to 88.0 (DE 7.5) mm Hg (P < .019) with no 
      changes in antihypertensive treatment. Cinacalcet was suspended in one patient 
      because of gastrointestinal discomfort and in another one because the iPTH was 
      reduced to 51 pg/mL. Cinacalcet is an effective treatment for persistent 
      hyperparathyroidism associated with hypercalcemia among renal transplant patients 
      and may be helpful for hypertension control.

AB  - Serum receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B ligand and osteoprotegrin are 
      mediated to vascular calcification in the general population. Our knowledge is very 
      sparse in hemodialysis and renal transplant patients. Receptor activator of nuclear 
      factor-κ B ligand, osteoprotegrin, intact parathyroid hormone, calcium, and 
      phosphorus were measured in blood samples of 45 hemodialysis and 45 age-matched 
      renal transplant patients. Osteoprotegrin (P = 0.001) and intact parathyroid hormone 
      (P = 0.001) levels in the hemodialysis patients were higher than the renal 
      transplant recipients. Osteoprotegrin had positive correlation with duration of 
      dialysis and age in the hemodialysis (r = 0.88, P = 0.001 and r = 0.34, P = 0.02, 
      respectively) and renal transplant patients (r = 0.92, P = 0.001 and r = 0.46, P = 
      0.001, respectively). Hemodialysis patients have higher osteoprotegrin levels than 
      the renal transplant recipients. It may act as a protective factor for renal 
      osteodystrophy or only as a secondary phenomenon of advanced renal failure.

TI  - Inhibition of the progression of aortic calcification by etidronate treatment in 
      hemodialysis patients: long-term effects.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - To confirm the inhibitory effect of etidronate on the progression of vascular 
      calcification (VC), 21 patients were randomly enrolled. All 21 patients had 
      end-stage renal disease and were undergoing hemodialysis (HD) three times per week. 
      Patients were observed clinically for 12 months before etidronate treatment and then 
      etidronate was given orally just prior to sleep on the days of dialysis for 23 
      months. The aortic calcification area (ACA) increased significantly during the 12 
      months before etidronate treatment. While the ACA of the drug-treated group did not 
      change 12 and 23 months after the initiation of etidronate treatment, the ACA in the 
      control group was significantly elevated 23 months later. These results strongly 
      indicate that etidronate inhibits the progression of VC. Bone mineral density did 
      not change during etidronate treatment. Our findings suggest that etidronate might 
      effectively protect against progressive VC in HD patients.

TI  - Serum osteoprotegerin levels and the extent of vascular calcification in 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1886-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a glycoprotein that inhibits osteoclast 
      differentiation and activity. OPG-deficient mice develop severe osteoporosis and 
      medial arterial calcification. The expression of OPG is detected in early 
      atherosclerotic lesions in non-uraemic patients. We examined whether serum OPG is 
      associated with aortic calcification in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: Serum OPG 
      was measured in 102 patients who were undergoing haemodialysis. The aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) was assessed by computed tomography scans. RESULTS: Serum 
      OPG level, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was significantly greater 
      in patients with higher ACI than in those with lower ACI. There was a direct 
      relationship between ACI and serum OPG levels and a positive association between OPG 
      and ACI (r = 0.483, P<0.0001). Multiple regression analyses indicated that serum OPG 
      levels were independently associated with the severity of aortic calcification 
      (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that serum OPG levels are associated 
      with the extent of vascular calcification, suggesting that OPG may be involved in 
      the development of vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.

PG  - 81-4
AB  - Bone changes in 138 patients under hemodialysis were evaluated by radiological 
      methods. Bone mass as was assessed by clavicular score was reduced in patients with 
      chronic renal failure compared with control subjects, especially in male patients, 
      and showed the gradual decrease with aging in both sexes. The incidence of 
      disappearance of lamina dura and that of vascular calcification increased with aging 
      in chronic renal failure. Although serum PTH did not show much difference among 
      various age groups, serum CT and calcium were significantly elevated in 20--24 years 
      of age group compared with other age groups. The etiology of decrease of bone mass 
      in male subjects was discussed from the standpoint of decreased gonadal activity.

TI  - Circulating endotoxemia: a novel factor in systemic inflammation and cardiovascular 
      disease in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 133-41
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04610510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Translocated endotoxin derived from intestinal bacteria 
      has a wide range of adverse effects on cardiovascular (CV) structure and function, 
      driving systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis and oxidative stress. This study's 
      aim was to investigate endotoxemia across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Circulating endotoxin was 
      measured in 249 patients comprising CKD stage 3 to 5 and a comparator cohort of 
      hypertensive patients without significant renal impairment. Patients underwent 
      extended CV assessment, including pulse wave velocity and vascular calcification. 
      Hemodialysis (HD) patients also received detailed echocardiographic-based 
      intradialytic assessments. Patients were followed up for 1 year to assess survival. 
      RESULTS: Circulating endotoxemia was most notable in those with the highest CV 
      disease burden (increasing with CKD stage), and a sharp increase was observed after 
      initiation of HD. In HD patients, predialysis endotoxin correlated with 
      dialysis-induced hemodynamic stress (ultrafiltration volume, relative hypotension), 
      myocardial stunning, serum cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive 
      protein. Endotoxemia was associated with risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CKD 
      patients are characteristically exposed to significant endotoxemia. In particular, 
      HD-induced systemic circulatory stress and recurrent regional ischemia may lead to 
      increased endotoxin translocation from the gut. Resultant endotoxemia is associated 
      with systemic inflammation, markers of malnutrition, cardiac injury, and reduced 
      survival. This represents a crucial missing link in understanding the 
      pathophysiology of the grossly elevated CV disease risk in CKD patients, 
      highlighting the potential toxicity of conventional HD and providing a novel set of 
      potential therapeutic strategies to reduce CV mortality in CKD patients.

TI  - Osteomalacic dialysis osteodystrophy: a trial of phosphate-enriched dialysis fluid.
PG  - 18-20
AB  - To assess whether phosphate depletion is an aetiological factor in osteomalacic 
      dialysis osteodystrophy we undertook a prospective trial of phosphate-enriched 
      dialysis fluid, in association with oral 1alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, for this 
      condition. Thirty patients started the trial; of the 27 who completed more than 6 
      months' treatment, 14 had iliac crest bone biopsies at the beginning and end of the 
      treatment period. Side effects included pruritus, stiffness, and increase in corneal 
      and vascular calcification. Only one patient showed histological improvement of 
      osteomalacia, and eight deteriorated; in seven the osteitis fibrosa worsened. 
      Myopathy showed some improvement in four patients, but became worse in four. This 
      treatment does not seem to have a place in the routine management of 
      non-hypophosphataemic patients on dialysis.

      for cardiovascular mortality in the general population, it is unknown whether this 
      is also true in hemodialysis patients in whom vascular calcification and 
      cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTINGS & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 515 patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy at a single center. 
      PREDICTOR: AAC evaluated in a plain roentgenograph of the lateral abdomen at 
      baseline. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular death. RESULTS: Mean 
      age was 60 +/- 12 (SD) years. AAC was present in 291 patients (56.5%). During a mean 
      follow-up period of 51 +/- 17 months, there were 103 all-cause deaths, of which 41 
      were from cardiovascular diseases. Of patients with and without AAC, 27.8% and 9.8% 
      died, respectively (11.6% and 3.1% of cardiovascular diseases, respectively). 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that all-cause mortality was significantly greater in 
      patients with AAC compared to those without (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). Similarly, 
      cardiovascular mortality was significantly greater in the former than in the latter 
      group (P = 0.0001, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis 
      found that the presence of AAC was significantly associated with increased all-cause 
      mortality (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 3.56; P < 0.01) and 
      increased cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.01 to 5.66; P < 0.05) after adjustment for age, hemodialysis duration, presence of 
      diabetes, serum albumin level, and C-reactive protein level. LIMITATIONS: 
      Nonquantitative assessment of AAC and the lack of information for medication and 
      history of cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: The presence of AAC is significantly 
      associated with both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients, suggesting that careful attention should be given to the presence of AAC 
      in a simple radiograph of the lateral abdomen as a prognostic indicator.

TI  - Lethal post-transplantation calcinosis.
PG  - 21-5
AB  - The case studies of four patients with post-transplantation calcinosis are 
      presented. Three of the four patients died of inanition and sepsis secondary to 
      infection of extensive soft tissue ulcers and diffuse cutaneous vascular 
      calcification with gangrene. The fourth patient survived following removal of all 
      four parathyroid glands and autografting of approximately one-half of one gland. 
      Common to the patients was secondary hyperparathyroidism, elevated mean serum 
      calcium levels after transplantation, and radiographic evidence of small and medium 
      vessel calcification. No other differences could be found between these patients and 
      other patients with post-transplantation hyperparathyroidism without calcinosis. In 
      the face of apparently minor complaints of lower extremity discomfort, elevated 
      parathyroid hormone levels (PTH) and positive xerography may indicate subtotal 
      parathyroidectomy regardless of the serum calcium level.

TI  - Vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 4183-6
AB  - The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include 
      duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, 
      hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was 
      performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis 
      population. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent 
      plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or 
      negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 
      calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients 
      (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for 
      duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = 
      .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or 
      iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not 
      different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to 
      NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = 
      .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, 
      P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the 
      duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular 
      calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other 
      factors in patients with longer dialysis.

TI  - Metastatic pulmonary calcification in a dialysis patient: case report and a review.
PG  - S51-5
AB  - A 19-year-old male presented with chest pain and dyspnea. He was anephric following 
      nephrectomy for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, had a subsequent failed 
      transplant, and had been dialysis dependent for 3 years. Workup revealed 
      hyperparathyroidism and an abnormal chest X-ray and computed tomography scan, 
      significant for massive extra-skeletal pulmonary calcification. A markedly abnormal 
      Technitium99 methylene diphosphonate (Tc99m-MDP) bone scan confirmed the clinical 
      suspicion of metastatic pulmonary calcification. Metastatic pulmonary calcification 
      (MPC) is common, occurring in 60% to 80% of dialysis patients on autopsy and bone 
      scan series. It may lead to impaired oxygenation and restrictive lung disease. 
      Typically, the calcium crystal is whitlockite rather than hydroxyapatite, which 
      occurs in vascular calcification. Four major predisposing factors may contribute to 
      MPC in dialysis patients. First, chronic acidosis leaches calcium from bone. Second, 
      intermittent alkalosis favors deposition of calcium salts. Third, 
      hyperparathyroidism tends to cause bone resorption and intracellular hypercalcemia. 
      Finally, low glomerular filtration rate can cause hyperphosphatemia and an elevated 
      calcium-phosphorus product. There may be other factors. Some authors suggest that 
      the incidence of MPC in recent years may be lower due to improved dialysis 
      techniques. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy, but can be suspected by typical 
      findings on a Tc99m-MDP bone scan. Therapy is limited to ensuring adequate dialysis, 
      correcting calcium-phosphorus product, and hyperparathyroidism; discontinuing 
      vitamin D analogues may help. Conflicting reports show that transplantation may 
      either improve or worsen the situation. MPC should be considered in dialysis 
      patients who have characteristic abnormal chest radiography and/or pulmonary 
      symptoms.

AB  - While all mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are unknown, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be 
      involved in this process in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the association between ACE2 and CAC in patients on MHD 
      therapy. Ninety patients on MHD therapy were involved in this prospective study. CAC 
      was quantified by CAC score (CACs) using the Agatston method and a multi-slice CT 
      scanner. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the 
      association between ACE2 and CACs. In the univariate analysis, CACs positively 
      correlated with ACE2 (r = 0.666, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, 
      hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, ACE2 levels 
      continued to significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve 
      analysis showed that the serum ACE2 level can predict the extent of CAC. These 
      findings indicate that elevated serum ACE2 may be involved in vascular calcification 
      in patients receiving MHD therapy.

TI  - Factors influencing transperitoneal calcium balance during CAPD.
PG  - M589-92
AB  - A dialysate containing a calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/L has been the standard 
      in CAPD for a long time. This concentration was chosen to achieve a positive calcium 
      balance to suppress hyperparathyroidism. In the measurement of peritoneal calcium 
      mass transfer, conflicting results have been published, with positive and negative 
      calcium balances reported. These differences have been explained by differences in 
      the filtration rate, and a negative correlation between the filtration rate and the 
      peritoneal calcium mass transfer can be found. Whereas nearly all patients in this 
      study had a negative calcium balance using a glucose solution of 3.86%, a wide 
      variation was found for the 1.36% glucose solution. There were several patients who 
      had a positive calcium balance despite a positive filtration rate. The explanation 
      for this finding lay in differences in serum concentrations of calcium, and 
      especially differences in the size of the total exchangeable calcium pool that 
      contains the plasma calcium compartment. A negative correlation between peritoneal 
      calcium balance and the size of the total exchangeable calcium pool could be 
      demonstrated. This finding may explain the differences in the peritoneal calcium 
      flux reported in the literature. As an enlargement of the exchangeable calcium pool 
      correlates with the progression of vascular calcification, therapeutic efforts 
      should be directed toward prevention of an enlargement of this pool.

      phosphate binders that remain in widespread use in the dialysis population. We 
      conducted a pilot study examining whether the use of a combined 
      magnesium/calcium-based binder was as effective as calcium carbonate at lowering 
      serum phosphate levels in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-over, investigator-masked pilot study in which prevalent PD patients received 
      calcium carbonate alone (200 mg calcium per tablet) or calcium magnesium carbonate 
      (100 mg calcium, 85 mg magnesium per tablet). Primary outcome was serum phosphate 
      level at 3 months. Analysis was as per protocol. RESULTS: Twenty patients were 
      recruited, 17 completed the study. Mean starting dose was 11.35 ± 7.04 pills per day 
      of MgCaCO3 and 9.00 ± 4.97 pills per day of CaCO3. Mean phosphate levels fell from 
      2.13 mmol/L to 2.01 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.76 - 2.30, p = 0.361) in 
      the MgCaCO3 group, and 1.81 mmol/L (95% CI: 1.56 - 2.0, p = 0.026) in the CaCO3 
      alone group. Six (35%) patients taking MgCaCO3 and 9 (54%) taking CaCO3 alone 
      achieved Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) serum phosphate targets 
      at 3 months. Diarrhea developed in 9 patients taking MgCaCO3 and 3 taking CaCO3. 
      Serum magnesium exceeded 1.4 mmol/L in 5 patients taking MgCaCO3 while serum calcium 
      exceeded 2.65 mmol/L in 3 patients receiving CaCO3. When compared to the initial 
      dose, the prescribed dose at 3 months was reduced by 44% (to 6.41 tablets/day) in 
      the MgCaCO3 group and by 8% (to 8.24 pills per day) in the CaCO3 alone group. 
      CONCLUSION: Compared with CaCO3 alone, the preparation and dose of MgCaCO3 used in 
      this pilot study was no better at lowering serum phosphate levels in PD patients, 
      and was associated with more dose-limiting side effects.

TI  - High Dephosphorylated-Uncarboxylated MGP in Hemodialysis patients: risk factors and 
      response to vitamin K(2), A pre-post intervention clinical trial.
PG  - 191

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients. 
      Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) was found to increase in vitamin 
      K-deficient patients and may be associated with vascular calcifications. 
      Supplementation of hemodialysis patients with vitamin K(2) (menaquinone-7) has been 
      studied in Europe with a maximum 61% drop of dp-ucMGP levels. The aim of this study 
      is to assess first the drop of dp-ucMGP in an Eastern Mediterranean cohort after 
      vitamin K(2) treatment and second the correlation between baseline dp-ucMGP and 
      vascular calcification score. METHODS: This is a prospective, pre-post intervention 
      clinical trial involving 50 hemodialysis patients who received daily 360 μg of 
      menaquinone-7 for 4 weeks. At baseline they were assessed for plasma dp-ucMGP levels 
      and vascular calcification scores (AC-24) as well as for other demographic, clinical 
      and biological variables. Dp-ucMGP levels were measured a second time at 4 weeks. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, dp-ucMGP levels were extremely elevated with a median of 
      3179.15 (1825.25; 4339.50) pM and correlated significantly with AC-24 (Spearman's 
      rho = 0.43, P = 0.002). Using a bivariate regression analysis, the association 
      between dp-ucMGP levels and AC-24 was most significant when comparing dp-ucMGP 
      levels less than 1000 to those more than 1000 pM (P = 0.02). Dp-ucMGP levels higher 
      than 5000 pM were significantly associated with females, patients with recent 
      fracture and patients with lower serum albumin (respectively P = 0.02, 0.004 and 
      0.046). The average drop of dp-ucMGP at 4 weeks of treatment was found to be 86% 
      with diabetics having the lowest drop rate (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Vitamin K 
      deficiency, as assessed by high dp-ucMGP levels, is profound in hemodialysis 
      patients from the Eastern Mediterranean region and it is significantly correlated 
      with vascular calcifications. Daily 360 μg of menaquinone-7, given for 4 weeks, 
      effectively reduces dp-ucMGP in this population. Future studies are needed to assess 
      the changes in vascular calcifications in hemodialysis patients treated with vitamin 
      K(2) over a longer follow-up period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The clinical trial was 
      registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identification number NCT02876354 , on August 11, 
      2016).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent hyperparathyroidism (HPT) with hypercalcemia is prevalent 
      after transplant and is considered a risk factor for progressive bone loss and 
      fractures and vascular calcification, as well as the development of 
      tubulointerstitial calcifications of renal allografts and graft dysfunction. The 
      subtotal parathyroidectomy is the standard treatment, although currently it has been 
      replaced by the calcimimetic cinacalcet. AIM: The hypothesis of this study is that 
      subtotal parathyroidectomy is superior to cinacalcet for treatment of persistent 
      secondary parathyroidectomy post renal transplant, with minimal morbidity and 
      significantly it reduces the cost of treatment after transplantation. METHODS: We 
      report our long-term clinical experience with either cinacalcet or parathyroidectomy 
      in 59 kidney transplant recipients with hyperparathyroidism. Group one included 
      medical treatment with cinacalcet and had 45 patients while parathyroidectomy 
      patients (group 2) were 16 patients with two of them excluded because of surgical 
      failure. RESULTS: No difference was found between groups for any parameter. A 
      greater short-term change of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis obtained by surgery 
      than by cinacalcet, and in long term change, no significant difference between the 
      two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this study are that correction of 
      severe hyperparathyroidism was similar in both surgical and cinacalcet groups with 
      the absence of a difference of long-term serum iPTH 1-84 levels between the two 
      groups.

AB  - The hemodialysis (HD) procedure induces an inflammatory response potentially 
      contributing to cardiovascular disease. Here we investigated the acute impact of HD 
      on circulating biomarkers. Circulating biomarkers (small solutes, middle 
      molecular-sized peptides, and proteins) related to inflammation, oxidative stress, 
      and vascular calcification (VC) were measured before and after a single session of 
      HD in 45 clinically stable patients. Concentrations were corrected for 
      ultrafiltration-induced hemoconcentration. Among vascular calcification-related 
      biomarkers, osteoprotegerin and fetuin-A remained unchanged while fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF23) decreased by -19%. Changes of FGF23 and changes of phosphate 
      correlated (ρ = 0.61, P < 0.001). While C-reactive protein did not change, 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased by 14% and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) increased by 45%. IL-6 
      and PTX3 appear to be valid biomarkers of the intradialytic inflammatory response. 
      VC-related markers were in general not affected by the single HD session; however, 
      the observed correlation between acute changes of FGF-23 and phosphate during HD 
      warrants further studies.

TI  - Baseline FGF23 is Associated with Cardiovascular Outcome in Incident PD Patients.
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2013.00343 [doi]
AB  - ♦ BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a phosphate regulating protein. 
      Several studies demonstrated that elevated FGF23 is independently associated with 
      mortality for early-stage chronic kidney disease and incident hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. However, little is known about the significance of elevated FGF23 in 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Here, we analyzed the association of FGF23 with 
      cardiovascular (CV) events, all-cause mortality, residual renal function (RRF), and 
      CV parameters in PD patients. ♦ METHODS: The present study is a single-center, 
      retrospective study. Patients who started PD at Seoul National University Hospital 
      between January 2005 and July 2011 and whose baseline serum samples were available 
      were enrolled. C-terminal FGF23 was measured. Subjects were divided into 2 groups; 
      lower 2 tertiles (FGF23 ≤ 119.0 RU/mL) and top tertile (FGF23 > 119.0 RU/mL). The 
      primary outcome was time to fatal or non-fatal CV events. In the subgroup analysis, 
      the associations of FGF23 with aortic stiffness or with vascular calcification were 
      analyzed. ♦ RESULTS: A total of 205 incident PD patients were analyzed. Mean 
      duration of follow-up was 41.6 ± 20.0 months. The baseline median FGF23 level was 
      78.6 RU/mL (inter-quartile range [IQR], 34.1 - 155.0). At baseline, subjects in the 
      higher FGF23 group were younger, and had a lower RRF, lower prevalence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular disease. During follow-up, 22 of the 205 patients 
      (10.7%) reached primary outcome. After adjustment for age, DM, pre-existing coronary 
      artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and left 
      ventricular mass index, the higher FGF23 group exhibited significantly higher risk 
      of primary outcome, compared with the lower group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.54; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.05 - 6.12; p = 0.045). There were no significant 
      differences in all-cause mortality and development of anuria between the 2 FGF23 
      groups. In the subgroup analysis, FGF23 groups were not associated with pulse wave 
      velocity and abdominal aortic calcification score. ♦ CONCLUSION: Elevated FGF23 is 
      associated with higher risk of adverse CV outcome for incident PD patients.

TI  - Long-term effects of magnesium carbonate on coronary artery calcification and bone 
      mineral density in hemodialysis patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 453-9

AB  - Observational data suggest that elevated magnesium levels in dialysis patients may 
      prevent vascular calcification and in vitro magnesium can prevent hydroxyapatite 
      crystal growth. However, the effects of magnesium on vascular calcification and bone 
      mineral density have not been studied prospectively. Seven chronic hemodialysis 
      patients participated in this open label, prospective pilot study to evaluate the 
      effects of a magnesium-based phosphate binder on coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      scores and vertebral bone mineral density (V-BMD) in patients with baseline CAC 
      scores >30. Magnesium carbonate/calcium carbonate (elemental Mg: 86 mg/elemental Ca 
      100 mg) was administered as the principal phosphate binder for a period of 18 months 
      and changes in CAC and V-BMD were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Serum 
      magnesium levels averaged 2.2+/-0.4 mEq/L (range: 1.3-3.9 mEq/L). Phosphorus levels 
      (4.5+/-0.6 mg/dL) were well controlled throughout the 18 months study. Electron beam 
      computed tomography results demonstrated a small not statically significant increase 
      in absolute CAC scores, no significant change in median percent change, and a small 
      none significant change in V-BMD. Magnesium may have a favorable effect on CAC. The 
      long-term effect on bone mineral density remains unclear. Larger studies are needed 
      to confirm these findings.

TI  - Long-term sevelamer treatment lowers serum fibroblast growth factor 23 accompanied 
      with increasing serum Klotho levels in chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 672-8
LID - 10.1111/nep.12319 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and Klotho are associated with vascular 
      calcification and cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients. Sevelamer has been 
      shown to reduce progression of vascular calcification. This study aimed to determine 
      the long-term effect of sevelamer treatment on serum FGF23 and Klotho levels in 
      chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In the post-hoc analysis, we measured 
      serum FGF23, Klotho and other biochemical factors (Ca, P, i-PTH, hsCRP, LDL-C) in 50 
      haemodialysis patients, who completed a 48-week, open-Label, controlled randomized 
      parallel-group study. Twenty-three patients received sevelamer and 27 patients 
      received calcium carbonate. RESULTS: After 48-week sevelamer treatment, there were 
      significant changes with lower LDL-C (from 2.82 ± 0.78 to 1.65 ± 0.53 mmol/L, 
      P = 0.000), lower FGF23 (from 2465.97 (2568.88) to 795.61 (1098.39), P = 0.000) and 
      higher s-Klotho levels (from 189.35 (161.88) to 252.94 (517.80) pg/mL, P = 0.000). 
      In calcium carbonate group, there were no significant changes of LDL-C and FGF23, 
      but with a borderline significant increase of s-Klotho level (from 142.34 (265.24) 
      to 188.57 (252.38) pg/mL, P = 0.054). Multivariate analysis showed that FGF23 
      decrement was associated with sevelamer treatment (β = -0.277, P = 0.005), change of 
      serum phosphate (β = 0.609, P = 0.000) and calcium levels (β = 0.635, P = 0.000). 
      The increase of serum Klotho was associated with the decrease of serum phosphate 
      (β = 0.490, P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Maintenance HD patients had lower serum FGF23 
      levels, accompanied with significantly increased serum Klotho levels, after 48-week 
      sevelamer treatment. The FGF23 decrement was associated with sevelamer use, the 
      change of serum phosphate and calcium levels. The serum Klotho increment was 
      proportional to the phosphate-lowering power of the binders.

TI  - Peritoneal magnesium elimination and its clinical relevance in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 181-186
LID - 10.5414/CN110115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients are at increased risk for vascular calcification and 
      cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggests that magnesium might be protective 
      for the vascular system in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as well. However, only 
      limited data is available on the elimination of magnesium through PD treatment. This 
      study aims to evaluate the peritoneal magnesium elimination characteristics in 
      comparison to other small solutes and the influence of peritoneal transport status. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peritoneal elimination of magnesium, blood-urea-nitrogen 
      (BUN), and creatinine during a 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was 
      assessed in 30 stable PD patients. Absolute magnesium elimination was compared 
      overall and between creatinine transport tertiles. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years, 
      50% of patients were male, 20% were on automated PD treatment. Serum magnesium was 
      0.84 mmol/L, and dialysate magnesium at the end of the PET was 0.57 mmol/L in the 
      overall cohort and did not differ significantly between tertiles. The magnesium 
      dialysate-to-plasma ratio was significantly different between the subgroups (lower 
      tertile: median 0.60 (minimum 0.52, maximum 0.68) vs. middle tertile: 0.64 (0.58, 
      0.68) vs. upper tertile: 0.69 (0.67, 0.74), p &lt; 0.001). The elimination per liter 
      of dialysis fluid was also significantly different (8.6 (6.6, 10.4) vs. 9.4 (8.0, 
      10.5) vs. 10.6 (0.2, 11.8) mg/L, p = 0.002), as was the absolute removal during the 
      4-hour dwell (18.6 (15.8, 21.2) vs. 19.4 (13.4, 24.6) vs. 22.7 (19.6, 31.9) mg, 
      p = 0.007, respectively). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal magnesium elimination is similar to 
      small solute transport characteristics. However, the absolute differences among 
      patients with slower and faster transport types are small. Therefore, magnesium 
      supplementation in PD patients should be guided by serum magnesium concentrations 
      rather than the amount of peritoneal elimination.

TI  - Serum albumin, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and fetuin a as predictors of 
      malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in patients with ESRD.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum albumin (S-Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 
      (IL-6) predict malnutrition, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fetuin A, an inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification, also is associated strongly with clinical outcome in 
      patients with ESRD. In this study, multivariate analyses were performed to assess 
      these 4 biomarkers as predictors of malnutrition, CVD, and mortality in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with ESRD (54 +/- 12 years) 
      underwent measurements of S-Alb, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), plasma IL-6, and 
      fetuin A close to the start of dialysis therapy and were followed up for a median of 
      26 months (range, 1 to 66 months). Nutritional status was evaluated by means of 
      subjective global assessment. CVD was defined based on medical history. Associations 
      between biomarker levels and malnutrition, CVD, and mortality were evaluated by 
      means of receiver operating characteristic curve, logistic regression analysis, and 
      Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: All 4 biomarkers predicted malnutrition, 
      CVD, and mortality. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, showed that malnutrition was predicted best by hs-CRP and 
      IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; and mortality, by albumin and IL-6 levels. When 
      using the cutoff levels derived from receiver operating characteristics, logistic 
      regression analysis showed that only hs-CRP level (odds ratio [OR], 3.6) was 
      associated with malnutrition, and only IL-6 level (OR, 3.7) was associated with CVD. 
      Levels of S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A, but not hs-CRP, were associated with increased 
      relative risk for mortality as assessed by Cox in a model adjusting for age, sex, 
      and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analyses show that in patients with 
      ESRD, malnutrition is predicted best by hs-CRP and IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; 
      and mortality, by S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A levels, but not by hs-CRP level. This 
      comparative analysis indicates that of these biomarkers, IL-6 level may be the most 
      reliable predictor of CVD and mortality in patients with ESRD.

TI  - Vascular calcification, autonomic neuropathy, and peripheral blood flow in patients 
      with diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - The possibility that digital gangrene in patients with diabetic nephropathy might be 
      due to abnormalities of peripheral blood flow secondary to vascular calcification 
      has been investigated. Twenty patients with renal failure due to diabetic 
      nephropathy were studied. Peripheral blood flow was measured using venous occlusion 
      plethysmography, together with an assessment of medial arterial calcification on 
      plain radiographs of the hands and feet, and transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2). 
      Hallux blood flow was markedly raised (median 22.5, range 11.5-56.5, ml min-1 
      100-ml-1) compared with non-diabetic control subjects (4.7, 1.1-10.5, ml min-1 
      100-ml-1; p less than 0.01) and similar to that in diabetic patients with autonomic 
      neuropathy (29.5, 16.7-49.6, ml min-1 100-ml-1). Although vascular calcification was 
      common and extensive in the patients with diabetic nephropathy, TcPO2 measurements 
      in the supine foot were normal and did not indicate tissue ischaemia. We conclude 
      that despite extensive vascular calcification high peripheral blood flow occurs in 
      the feet of these patients at rest together with normal transcutaneous oxygen 
      tension.

TI  - Trends and dynamics of changes in calcification score over the 1-year observation 
      period in patients on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 517-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated vascular calcification is an important cause of excess 
      mortality in patients on dialysis therapy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the 
      trends in coronary artery calcification (CAC) score (CaSc) during a 1-year period in 
      a group of stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and identify factors that may be 
      associated with CaSc changes. METHODS: Sixty-one stable patients (28 women, 33 men) 
      on PD therapy with a mean age of 50.4 +/- 13.6 years were included. Forty-seven 
      patients survived the entire study period on PD therapy and were suitable for the 
      final analysis. CaSc was assessed at baseline and after 12 months by using 
      multislice spiral computed tomography. Proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein 
      [CRP], fibrinogen), calcium-phosphate balance, and lipid profile were assessed at 
      baseline and after 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Median CaSc was 22.6 Agatston units 
      (range, 0 to 5,502.8 Agatston units) at baseline and increased to 84 Agatston units 
      (range, 0 to 5,001.3 Agatston units) at a 1-year follow-up (P < 0.05). In the entire 
      group of patients, 3 subgroups were identified: patients with progression (n = 21; P 
      = 0.02 for the difference between initial versus follow-up CaSc), patients with 
      regression (n = 12; P = 0.05), and subjects without change in CaSc after 1 year (n = 
      14). Patients without progression showed no calcifications at baseline and follow-up 
      and were younger, less overweight, and characterized by significantly lower mean 
      TNF-alpha, leptin, and CRP levels during 1 year compared with both progressors and 
      regressors. Mean serum phosphate and calcium x phosphate product (Ca x P) values 
      were gradually increasing from regressors through the no-calcification group to 
      progressors (P < 0.01 for phosphate levels, P < 0.02 for Ca x P product). 
      Significant correlations were found between changes in CaScs and mean values for 
      phosphate (R = 0.44; P < 0.0005) and Ca x P product (R = 0.38; P < 0.005). 
      CONCLUSION: Chronic nonspecific inflammation does not directly attribute to 
      progression in CaScs. Calcium-phosphate balance abnormalities appear to be the only 
      important factors promoting CAC, although a permissive or promoting role of 
      inflammation cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Management of calcium, phosphorus and bone metabolism in dialysis patients using 
      sevelamer hydrochloride and vitamin D therapy.
PG  - S16-21
AB  - Abnormalities of mineral metabolism, including those of calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis induce 
      severe bone involvement, which manifests as renal osteodystrophy. Recently, vascular 
      calcification caused by abnormal mineral metabolism has been attracting attention 
      because cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of death in hemodialysis 
      patients. Since 2000, the treatment standard for overt secondary hyperparathyroidism 
      (SHPT) in our facilities has shifted from conventional or pulse therapy with oral 
      vitamin D3 (VitD) to intravenous pulse therapy with maxacalcitriol or calcitriol. 
      After selecting the criterion of overt SHPT as intact-PTH>500 pg/mL, the proportion 
      of overt SHPT cases among all hemodialysis patients decreased from 12% at the start 
      of intravenous pulse treatment to 6.4% after 4 years' treatment. However, the number 
      of patients who had an interruption to pulse treatment because of hypercalcemia 
      and/or hyperphosphatemia was high and it became a bottleneck for the continuation of 
      the therapy. The major cause of hypercalcemia is considered to be Ca load derived 
      from oral calcium carbonate. In Japan, sevelamer hydrochrolide (SH), which does not 
      contain Ca, has been available commercially since 2003 and potentially should enable 
      a reduction in the incidence of overt SHPT during long-term intravenous treatment 
      when combined with careful adjustment of the dose of VitD and strict monitoring of 
      Ca and P level concentrations. In this study, we found that the proportion of 
      patients who satisfy the recommended serum concentrations of Ca and P reported by 
      K/DOQI guideline was low irrespective of the serum concentration of intact-PTH. The 
      aortic calcification index was high in the patient group with lower intact-PTH level 
      concentration, probably because of reduced Ca and P buffering ability associated 
      with reduced bone turnover. We consider that VitD treatment with SH might give 
      better control of the intact-PTH level concentration within the range recommended by 
      the K/DOQI guideline.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature vascular calcification (or rather ossification) significantly 
      contributes to morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 
      5 (CKD-5) and is linked to dysregulation of bone remodelling proteins. Recent 
      evidence of a cross-talk between bone and fat tissue urged us to investigate whether 
      the calcification/ossification-associated factors osteoprotegerin (OPG) and 
      alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) are expressed in human uremic subcutaneous adipose 
      tissue (SAT) and if the expression differs from nonuremic SAT. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Abdominal SAT biopsies were obtained from 38 patients with CKD-5 [16 women, 
      58 (22-73) years old] during the surgical insertion of a peritoneal dialysis 
      catheter and 20 controls [11 females, 56 (40-77) years old] undergoing elective 
      hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) quantifications were performed followed by immunohistochemical staining and 
      serum protein concentration measurements. Relative mRNA expression and protein 
      concentrations were evaluated together with clinical parameters. An additional 59 
      patients with CKD-5 were included for replication of statistical analyses. RESULTS: 
      OPG but not AHSG mRNAs were detected in SAT, which were also positively 
      immunolabelled for OPG. OPG mRNA levels were reduced (P = ·0001) and serum OPG 
      concentrations were elevated (P < 0·0001), both about twofold, in patients compared 
      to controls. Circulating OPG increased in proportion to BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Human SAT 
      expresses OPG but not AHSG, and OPG expression is reduced in patients with CKD-5 
      when compared to controls, despite increased circulating protein levels.

PG  - 53-8

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is elevated in patients with end-stage kidney 
      disease and has been linked with mortality, vascular calcification, markers of bone 
      turnover, and left ventricular hypertrophy. In this cohort study, we determined the 
      correlates of FGF-23 (including cardiac troponin T [cTNT]) and determined its 
      association with mortality over 3.5 years of follow-up in 103 prevalent hemodialysis 
      patients. Mean age was 61.2 (15.5) and the mean dialysis vintage was 4.19 years 
      (4.6). The median (interquartile range) FGF-23 was 1259 (491, 2885) RU/mL. 
      Independent predictors (estimate standard error) of log-transformed FGF-23 
      concentrations included phosphorus (0.75 [0.237], P = 0.002) and cardiac troponin T 
      (1.04 [0.41], P = 0.01). There were 57 deaths. In the fully adjusted model, the 
      significant predictors of mortality included age and albumin. The independent 
      association between FGF-23 and cTNT is a novel finding. Whether this relationship 
      supports the possibility that a downstream effect of dysregulated phosphorous 
      homeostasis may be enhanced cardiac remodeling requires further study.

TI  - [Multidetector row CT in assessment of coronary artery calcification on 
      hemodialisis].
PG  - 721-8
AB  - Vascular calcification is a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause 
      mortality. Coronary artery calcification is more frequent, more extensive and 
      progresses more rapidly in CKD than in general population. They are also considered 
      a marker of coronary heart disease, with high prevalence and functional 
      significance. It suggests that detection and surveillance may be worthwhile in 
      general clinical practice. New non-invasive image techniques, like Multi-detector 
      row CT, a type of spiral scanner, assess density and volume of calcification at 
      multiple sites and allow quantitative scoring of vascular calcification using 
      calcium scores analogous to those from electron-beam CT. We have assessed and 
      quantified coronary artery calcification with 16 multidetector row CT in 44 patients 
      on hemodialysis and their relationship with several cardiovascular risk factors. 
      Coronary artery calcification prevalence was of 84 % with mean calcium score of 1580 
      +/- 2010 ( r 0-9844) with calcium score > 400 in 66% of patients. It was usually 
      multiple, affecting more than two vessels in more than 50%. In all but one patient, 
      left anterior descending artery was involved with higher calcium score level at 
      right coronary artery. Advanced age, male, diabetes, smoking, more morbidity, 
      cerebrovascular disease previous, and calcium-binders phosphate and analogous 
      vitamin D treatment would seem to be associated with coronary artery calcification. 
      Coronary artery calcification is very frequent and extensive, usually multiple and 
      associated to modifiable risk factors in hemodialysis patients. Multi-detector-row 
      CT seems an effective, suitable, readily applicable method to assess and quantify 
      coronary artery calcification.

TI  - Cardiovascular calcification in Hispanic Americans (HA) with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) due to type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is common and severe in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on dialysis. However, the prevalence and severity of CVC is 
      less well documented in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on 
      dialysis. METHODS: Fifty-eight nondialyzed HA with type 2 diabetes and CKD were 
      enrolled. They comprise 29 patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD (early CKD group) and 26 
      patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (advanced CKD group). Coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) was measured by ultrafast spiral computed tomography, while peripheral artery 
      calcification (PAC) was evaluated by plain x-ray of the chest, pelvis, thighs, and 
      lower extremities. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC and PAC were significantly higher 
      in the advanced CKD group compared to the early CKD group (73% vs. 38%; P < 0.01 and 
      85% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001, respectively). The median CAC scores were 18-fold greater 
      in the advanced CKD group (138.9 vs. 7.8, respectively). By linear regression 
      analysis, a strong association was found between the level of renal function and ln 
      total volume of CAC. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that CAC and PAC are common and 
      severe in HA diabetic patients with CKD not previously treated with dialysis, 
      calcium-based phosphate binders, or vitamin D analogues. Lower level of renal 
      function is associated with increased burden of vascular calcification in 
      predialysis patients with CKD.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of etidronate on the progression of vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - The present study was designed to determine if etidronate inhibits the development 
      of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Eighteen Japanese HD patients 
      were divided randomly into etidronate-treated or control groups. Etidronate was 
      given orally at the dose of 200 mg just before sleep on the day of dialysis, which 
      was performed three times per week. In the control group, the aortic calcification 
      area (ACA) increased after 6 months. In the patients who received etidronate, 
      however, when compared to the control group, increases in ACA were significantly 
      suppressed. Serum Ca, P, and the Ca x P product did not change during etidronate 
      treatment. These results suggest that etidronate inhibits the progression of 
      vascular calcification without changes in serum Ca and P levels.

TI  - An optical method for serum calcium and phosphorus level assessment during 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 719-27
LID - 10.3390/toxins7030719 [doi]
AB  - Survival among hemodialysis patients is disturbingly low, partly because vascular 
      calcification (VC) and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent. Elevated serum 
      phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) levels play an essential role in the formation of VC 
      events. The purpose of the current study was to reveal optical monitoring 
      possibilities of serum P and Ca values during dialysis. Twenty-eight patients from 
      Tallinn (Estonia) and Linköping (Sweden) were included in the study. The serum 
      levels of Ca and P on the basis of optical information, i.e., absorbance and 
      fluorescence of the spent dialysate (optical method) were assessed. Obtained levels 
      were compared in means and SD. The mean serum level of Ca was 2.54 ± 0.21 and 2.53 ± 
      0.19 mmol/L; P levels varied between 1.08 ± 0.51 and 1.08 ± 0.48 mmol/L, measured in 
      the laboratory and estimated by the optical method respectively. The levels achieved 
      were not significantly different (p = 0.5). The Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement 
      between the two methods varied from -0.19 to 0.19 for Ca and from -0.37 to 0.37 in 
      the case of P. In conclusion, optical monitoring of the spent dialysate for 
      assessing the serum levels of Ca and P during dialysis seems to be feasible and 
      could offer valuable and continuous information to medical staff.

LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2014.09.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors 
      such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K 
      insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) 
      years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation. FACTOR: 
      Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K 
      status. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant failure. RESULTS: At inclusion, 
      median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients 
      having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median 
      follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) 
      developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at 
      considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile 
      (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). 
      After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion 
      of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained 
      significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing 
      transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs 
      Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney 
      function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7). 
      LIMITATIONS: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No 
      data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, 
      is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated 
      independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address 
      whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Factors associated with mortality in patients new to haemodialysis.
PG  - 3568-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving dialysis therapy for end-stage kidney failure have a 
      high cardiovascular mortality that can only be partially explained by traditional 
      risk factors. METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of a prospectively 
      gathered data set from a randomized trial comparing outcomes in new haemodialysis 
      patients treated with sevelamer or calcium-containing phosphate binders. Patients 
      were followed from the time of enrollment until death or censor on 31 December 2005. 
      Median follow-up was 3.6 years. Demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, 
      laboratory data, medication use and severity of vascular calcification were 
      available at baseline and over the first 18 months of dialysis. RESULTS: Baseline 
      predictors of mortality included age, creatinine, heart rate, iPTH, C-reactive 
      protein (CRP), coronary and aortic calcium scores and the presence of aortic valve 
      calcification. Over the first 18 months, averages of diastolic blood pressure, BUN, 
      creatinine, albumin, phosphorus, iPTH and CRP were all significantly different 
      between survivors and non-survivors. A stepwise multivariable adjusted Cox 
      regression model demonstrated that low BUN and albumin and high CRP along with the 
      use of calcium-containing phosphate binders (rather than sevelamer) were the 
      strongest predictors of mortality in patients new to haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that non-traditional risk factors, such as inflammation and 
      malnutrition measured during the first 18 months of dialysis, are important 
      determinates of survival in new dialysis patients. In addition, the unique risk 
      factor for dialysis patients, the use of calcium-containing phosphate binders, was 
      associated with a higher mortality rate in patients new to dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are prone to neointimal hyperplasia leading 
      to AVG failure. We hypothesized that pre-existing pathologic abnormalities of the 
      vessels used to create AVGs (including venous intimal hyperplasia, arterial intimal 
      hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification) are associated 
      with inferior AVG survival. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing placement of a new AVG 
      at a large medical center who had vascular specimens obtained at the time of surgery 
      (n = 76). PREDICTOR: Maximal intimal thickness of the arterial and venous intima, 
      arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial medial calcification. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: 
      Unassisted primary AVG survival (time to first intervention) and frequency of AVG 
      interventions. RESULTS: 55 patients (72%) underwent interventions and 148 graft 
      interventions occurred during 89.9 years of follow-up (1.65 interventions per 
      graft-year). Unassisted primary AVG survival was not associated significantly with 
      arterial intimal thickness (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.27; P = 0.3), venous intimal 
      thickness (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; P = 0.1), severe arterial medial fibrosis 
      (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.06; P = 0.6), or severe arterial calcification (HR, 0.68; 
      95% CI, 0.37-1.31; P = 0.3). The frequency of AVG interventions per year was 
      associated inversely with arterial intimal thickness (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% 
      CI, 1.16-3.42; P < 0.001 for thickness <10 vs. >25 μm), venous intimal thickness 
      (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001 for thickness <5 vs. >10 μm), arterial 
      medial fibrosis (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.96-5.13; P < 0.001 for fibrosis <70% vs. ≥70%), 
      and arterial calcification (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.31-3.43; P = 0.001 for <10% vs. ≥10% 
      calcification). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study. Study may be underpowered to 
      demonstrate differences in unassisted primary AVG survival. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pre-existing vascular pathologic abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease may not be associated significantly with unassisted primary AVG survival. 
      However, vascular intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial 
      calcification may be associated with a decreased frequency of AVG interventions.

LID - 10.1681/ASN.2015060622 [doi]
AB  - Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcemia after kidney 
      transplant. We designed this 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open-label, 
      randomized study to evaluate whether subtotal parathyroidectomy is more effective 
      than cinacalcet for controlling hypercalcemia caused by persistent 
      hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplant. Kidney allograft recipients with 
      hypercalcemia and elevated intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentration were 
      eligible if they had received a transplant ≥6 months before the study and had an 
      eGFR>30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) The primary end point was the proportion of patients 
      with normocalcemia at 12 months. Secondary end points were serum iPTH concentration, 
      serum phosphate concentration, bone mineral density, vascular calcification, renal 
      function, patient and graft survival, and economic cost. In total, 30 patients were 
      randomized to receive cinacalcet (n=15) or subtotal parathyroidectomy (n=15). At 12 
      months, ten of 15 patients in the cinacalcet group and 15 of 15 patients in the 
      parathyroidectomy group (P=0.04) achieved normocalcemia. Normalization of serum 
      phosphate concentration occurred in almost all patients. Subtotal parathyroidectomy 
      induced greater reduction of iPTH and associated with a significant increase in 
      femoral neck bone mineral density; vascular calcification remained unchanged in both 
      groups. The most frequent adverse events were digestive intolerance in the 
      cinacalcet group and hypocalcemia in the parathyroidectomy group. Surgery would be 
      more cost effective than cinacalcet if cinacalcet duration reached 14 months. All 
      patients were alive with a functioning graft at the end of follow-up. In conclusion, 
      subtotal parathyroidectomy was superior to cinacalcet in controlling hypercalcemia 
      in these patients with kidney transplants and persistent hyperparathyroidism.

TI  - Clinical assessment of atherosclerotic parameters and cardiac function in chronic

PG  - 651-8
LID - 10.1007/s10157-009-0220-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Atherosclerosis is evaluated by carotid mean intima-media thickness 
      (mean IMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and the aortic calcification index (ACI). We 
      have attempted to examine if these atherosclerotic parameters are associated with 
      each other and which parameters are closely related to cardiac function in chronic 
      HD patients. METHODS: The mean IMT, PWV and ACI were examined in 69 maintenance HD 
      patients using carotid ultrasonography, a blood volume plethysmographic apparatus 
      and abdominal CT, respectively. Echocardiographic studies were also performed for 
      measuring left ventricular (LV) geometry. Serum total cholesterol, high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, 
      C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium and phosphate were measured. RESULTS: The mean IMT 
      correlated positively with ACI (r = 0.461, P < 0.0001) and tended to be correlated 
      with PWV, but did not reach statistical significance. The PWV value correlated 
      positively with ACI (r = 0.494, P <or= 0.0001). The mean IMT correlated positively 
      with the LV mass index (r = 0.273, P = 0.0228), and fractional shortening (FS) 
      correlated negatively with PWV value (r = -0.293, P = 0.0141) and ACI score (r = 
      -0.289, P = 0.0158). Multivariate analyses indicated that the LV mass index was 
      independently associated with mean IMT (P = 0.0231) as well as systolic blood 
      pressure (P < 0.0001), pulse pressure (P < 0.0001) and hemoglobin (P = 0.016), and 
      FS is independently associated with ACI (P = 0.0162) as well as PWV (P = 0.0144) and 
      CRP (P = 0.0375). CONCLUSION: Atherosclerosis and reduced LV function are associated 
      with increased vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in chronic HD patients.

AB  - Hypertension is very common in dialysis patients. Disorders of mineral metabolism 
      have been linked to vascular calcification and hypertension in dialysis. Fifty-four 
      hemodialysis patients were included in a cross-sectional study in a dialysis unit 
      during a 6-month period. Linear regression analysis was done between averages of 
      calcium and phosphorus (ca x ph) product and blood pressures (BPs). Ca x ph was 
      significantly associated with systolic BP predialysis (P=.03, R=0.28), diastolic BP 
      predialysis (P=.001, R=0.44), predialysis mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P=.002, 
      R=0.4), and diastolic BP postdialysis (P=.03, R=0.26). No relationship was found 
      with pulse pressures. Multilinear regression analysis was then done between ca x ph 
      product and BPs adjusting for age, sex, hemoglobin, diabetes, albumin, parathyroid 
      hormone, ultrafiltration volume, and average BP medications per patient. There was a 
      strong positive association with predialysis systolic BP (P=.003, R(2)=0.49), 
      predialysis MAP (P=.001, R(2)=0.51), and postdialysis MAP (P=.02, R(2)=0.65). No 
      associations with pulse pressures were detected. The study findings suggest that ca 
      x ph product is significantly associated with dialysis MAP and not pulse pressure. 
      This is likely secondary to the stronger relationship with diastolic BP than with 
      systolic BP. Prospective studies looking into the associated hemodynamic parameters 
      related to arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction along with measures for 
      calcifications would be very beneficial.

TI  - Close association of vascular and valvular calcification and prognosis of patients 
      on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 60-4
AB  - In the present study, we examined the association between vascular and valvular 
      calcification and the prognosis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD). Data were collected from the records of patients introduced onto 
      CAPD therapy during 1999 - 2006 at the Department of Nephrology, Saitama Medical 
      University. At the start of CAPD, cardiac and vascular echography were used to 
      examine 162 patients (average age: 56 +/- 5 years; 58 men, 104 women; 43 with and 
      119 without diabetes) for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. Both 
      vascular and valvular calcification were found in 32 patients. Vascular 
      calcification was found in 16, and valvular calcification in 11. Over 5 years, 11 
      patients suffered from cardiovascular disease (7 with stroke, 4 with myocardial 
      infarction). All of these patients had vascular or valvular calcification at the 
      start of CAPD therapy. We also used Cox hazard analysis to examine values for Ca, P, 
      Ca x P, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and lipids. None of these values were 
      independent contributory factors for incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients 
      on CAPD. These data suggest the importance of vascular and valvular echography to 
      evaluate patients on CAPD, especially at the start of CAPD therapy. Vascular and 
      valvular calcification are important factors for determining the prognosis of 
      patients on CAPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients have high cardiovascular risk, and vascular 
      inflammation may play an important role. We explored whether the inflammatory state 
      in the vessel wall was related to carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) and patient 
      survival following kidney transplantation. METHODS: In this prospective 
      observational cohort study we measured c-IMT and expression of proinflammatory 
      cytokines and adhesion molecules in the inferior epigastric artery in 115 kidney 
      transplant candidates. Another c-IMT measurement was done 1-year 
      post-transplantation in 107. By stepwise multiple regression analysis we explored 
      factors associated with baseline c-IMT and their changes over time. Multivariate Cox 
      regression analysis was constructed to identify risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: 
      A worse cardiovascular profile (older age, smoker, diabetic, carotid plaque, 
      systolic blood pressure and vascular calcification) and higher VCAM-1 levels were 
      found in patients in the highest baseline c-IMT tertile, who also had a worse 
      survival. Factors independently related to baseline c-IMT were age (β=0.369, 
      P<0.0001), fasting glucose (β=0.168, P=0.045), smoking (β=0.228, P=0.003) and VCAM-1 
      levels (β=0.244, P=0.002). Independent factors associated with c-IMT measurement 
      1-year post-transplantation were baseline c-IMT (β=-0.677, P<0.0001), 
      post-transplant diabetes (β=0.225, P=0.003) and triglycerides (β=0.302, P=0.023). 
      Vascular VCAM-1 levels were associated with increased risk of mortality in bivariate 
      and multivariate Cox regression. Notably, nearly 50% of patients showed an increase 
      or maintenance of high c-IMT 1 year post-transplantation and these patients 
      experienced a higher mortality (13 versus 3.5%; P=0.021). CONCLUSION: A worse 
      cardiovascular profile and a higher vascular VCAM-1 protein levels at time of KT are 
      related to subclinical atheromatosis. This could lead to a higher post-transplant 
      mortality. Pre-transplant c IMT, post-transplant diabetes and triglycerides at 
      1-year post-transplantation may condition a high c-IMT measurement 
      post-transplantation, which may decrease patient survival.

TI  - Association of changes in bone remodeling and coronary calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients: a prospective study.
PG  - 1139-50
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2008.06.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common and constitutes a prognostic marker of 
      mortality in the hemodialysis population. Derangements of mineral metabolism may 
      influence its development. The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the 
      association between bone remodeling disorders and progression of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in hemodialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study nested 
      within a randomized controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 64 stable hemodialysis 
      patients. PREDICTOR: Bone-related laboratory parameters and bone histomorphometric 
      characteristics at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up. OUTCOMES: Progression of 
      CAC assessed by means of coronary multislice tomography at baseline and after 1 year 
      of follow-up. Baseline calcification score of 30 Agatston units or greater was 
      defined as calcification. Change in calcification score of 15% or greater was 
      defined as progression. RESULTS: Of 64 patients, 38 (60%) of the patients had CAC 
      and 26 (40%) did not [corrected]. Participants without CAC at baseline were younger 
      (P < 0.001), mainly men (P = 0.03) and nonwhite (P = 0.003), and had lower serum 
      osteoprotegerin levels (P = 0.003) and higher trabecular bone volume (P = 0.001). 
      Age (P = 0.003; beta coefficient = 1.107; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.036 to 
      1.183) and trabecular bone volume (P = 0.006; beta coefficient = 0.828; 95% CI, 
      0.723 to 0.948) were predictors for CAC development. Of 38 participants who had 
      calcification at baseline, 26 (68%) had CAC progression in 1 year. Progressors had 
      lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.03) and deoxypyridinoline levels (P 
      = 0.02) on follow-up, and low turnover was mainly diagnosed at the 12-month bone 
      biopsy (P = 0.04). Low-turnover bone status at the 12-month bone biopsy was the only 
      independent predictor for CAC progression (P = 0.04; beta coefficient = 4.5; 95% CI, 
      1.04 to 19.39). According to bone histological examination, nonprogressors with 
      initially high turnover (n = 5) subsequently had decreased bone formation rate (P = 
      0.03), and those initially with low turnover (n = 7) subsequently had increased bone 
      formation rate (P = 0.003) and osteoid volume (P = 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Relatively 
      small population, absence of patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, short 
      observational period. CONCLUSIONS: Lower trabecular bone volume was associated with 
      CAC development, whereas improvement in bone turnover was associated with lower CAC 
      progression in patients with high- and low-turnover bone disorders. Because CAC is 
      implicated in cardiovascular mortality, bone derangements may constitute a 
      modifiable mortality risk factor in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification in haemodialysis patients: role of calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.
PG  - 2037-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
      frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
      potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD 
      patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control 
      subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was 
      determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of 
      haemodialysis. RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients 
      than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% 
      vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older 
      than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, 
      had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
      highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and 
      the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also found a 
      positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was 
      found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple 
      stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters 
      for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more 
      frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and 
      with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age 
      (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and 
      calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support 
      careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage 
      renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

TI  - Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery in haemodialysis 
      patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - AIM: to look for differences in clinical characteristics, and differences in the 
      role of mineral metabolism disorders and inflammation in diabetic and non diabetic 
      patients. METHODS: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 46 with 
      DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery 
      were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest and lower extremities. Clinical 
      characteristics and laboratory values were taken from the medical records. RESULTS: 
      the overall prevalence of vascular calcification was similar in our haemodialysis 
      patients, with or without DM (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general 
      of older age (58.5+10.3 vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 
      vs 86+14 mmHg, p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery 
      calcification (13% vs 2.5%, p<0.05). Vascular calcification in diabetic 
      haemodialysis patients occurred at the same rate in spite of a lower serum P, 
      (5.7+1.5 vs 6.9+1.5 mg/dl, p<0.05), and Ca X P product (52.3+14.5 vs 60.7+14.5, 
      p<0.05), and shorter HD vintage (1.3+0.9 vs 3.2+3.3 years, p<0.05). In a sub 
      analysis comparing patients according to presence and location of vascular 
      calcification, patients with vascular calcification of the peripheral artery only 
      were mostly diabetics (75%), had lower serum Ca (8.6+0.5mg/dl), P (6.7+0.6mg/dl), Ca 
      x P product (57.4+5.10 mg2/dl2), and higher serum CRP (1.70+1.59mg/dl). CONCLUSION: 
      diabetic patients on HD may be at higher risk for peripheral artery calcification, 
      at lower serum Ca, P, and Ca X P product. The higher CRP may indicate a higher 
      inflammatory status, which is probably the major risk factor for vascular 
      calcification of the peripheral artery.

      following warfarin initiation.
PG  - 1158-62
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2010.06.017 [doi]
AB  - We describe a case of rapid onset of vascular calcification coincident with the 
      initiation of warfarin therapy in a kidney transplant recipient. Calcification 
      developed within the media of the blood vessel wall, with relative intimal sparing. 
      Medium and small arteries were affected; however, the aorta was mostly free of 
      calcifications, suggesting a differential response to warfarin between the intima 
      and media and between different vascular beds. In addition, unlike the highly 
      calcified native kidney's vessels, the kidney allograft was not calcified, 
      suggesting local genetically determined mechanisms in preventing vascular 
      calcification. Distal subcutaneous necrosis ultimately led to the patient's death.

TI  - Substitution of aluminium hydroxide by high doses of calcium carbonate in patients 
      on chronic haemodialysis: disappearance of hyperaluminaemia and equal control of 
      hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 784-7
AB  - Al(OH)3 was discontinued in 26 patients on chronic haemodialysis as well as vitamin 
      D metabolites in eight. Oral CaCO3 was progressively increased from 4 +/- 3 to 10 
      +/- 5g/d to keep plasma PO4 less than 6.0mg/dl and P Ca less than 10.5mg/dl. This 
      treatment had to be discontinued in three cases because of diarrhoea and/or 
      uncontrolled hyperphosphataemia. In the remaining patients the control of 
      hyperphosphataemia and of PTH values was as good or even better. Hyperaluminaemia 
      disappeared in most patients demonstrating the role of oral Al(OH)3 in the induction 
      of hyperaluminaemia. Because of frequent transient hypercalcaemia and of the 
      occurrence of vascular calcification in two patients, high doses of CaCO3 after 
      discontinuation of Al(OH)3 are advised only in cases of hyperaluminaemia.

TI  - High molecular weight adiponectin inhibits vascular calcification in renal allograft 
      recipients.
PG  - e0195066

LID - e0195066
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin (ADPN) prevents the development/recurrence of cardiovascular 
      events via its anti-atherogenic effects. However, few long-term studies have 
      examined the changes in serum ADPN levels and arterial calcification seen in renal 
      allograft recipients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of the serum ADPN level on 
      arterial calcification were examined in 51 Japanese renal allograft recipients. 
      Abdominal aorta calcification was evaluated on computed tomography using the aortic 
      calcification area index (ACAI). The change in the ACAI and serum 
      high-molecular-weight (HMW)-ADPN fractions were studied over an 8-year period. The 
      arterial expression of ADPN, ADPN receptors (AdipoR)1 and 2, and T-cadherin 
      (cadherin-13) were also examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The change in the 
      ACAI were grouped into quartiles and compared with the alterations in the serum 
      levels of each ADPN fraction over an 8-year period. The change in the ACAI was much 
      lower in the patients with highly elevated HMW-ADPN levels.Multiple regression 
      analysis demonstrated that an advanced age at transplant and a history of 
      cardiovascular complications were associated with an increased change in the ACAI, 
      while higher HMW-ADPN concentrations were associated with improvements in the ACAI. 
      Serum HDL-C level was also identified as a positive factor to increase serum 
      HMW-ADPN level.In immunohistochemical examinations, ADPN was detected on 
      CD31-positive arterial endothelial cells from renal allograft biopsy samples. ADPN 
      co-localized with T-cadherin and AdipoR1, but only partially co-localized with 
      AdipoR2. CONCLUSION: Both HMW-ADPN and HDL-C might inhibit the progression of 
      vascular calcification by promoting ADPN binding to vascular endothelial cells via 
      T-cadherin and AdipoR in Japanese renal allograft recipients.

TI  - Pentosidine in chronic hemodialysis patients: relation with arteriovenous fistula 
      morphology and function.
PG  - 1035-1042
LID - 10.1007/s11255-019-02151-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It has been suggested that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are 
      involved in atherogenesis, vascular calcification and remodeling, including 
      neointimal hyperplasia, in renal and non-renal patients. Their relevance for 
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) function has been poorly studied to date, with only one 
      clinical study addressing the issue of thrombosis of vascular access in relation to 
      AGEs in dialysis patients. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum 
      pentosidine and AVF morphology and function. METHODS: Eighty-eighth hemodialysis 
      patients with patent native AVF were included. Ultrasound examination of AVF 
      evaluated blood flow in the brachial artery, resistivity index (RI), the diameter of 
      the vessels and the presence of stenosis. AVF and cardiovascular history were 
      recorded, routine clinical and laboratory evaluation was performed and serum 
      pentosidine was assessed. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (54.54%) had AVF stenosis. 
      Pentosidine correlated in univariate analysis with cholesterol (r = 0.270, 
      p = 0.01), triglycerides (r = 0.309, p = 0.003), calcium (r = 0.040, p < 0.001) and 
      inversely to dialysis vintage (r = - 0.453, p < 0.001), access vintage (r = - 0.432, 
      p = 0.001), phosphate (r = - 0.211, p = 0.04), parathyroid hormone (r = - 0.211, 
      p = 0.04), urea (r = - 0.230, p = 0.03), residual diameter of AVF (r = - 0.023, 
      p = 0.03). In multivariate regression calcium (p = 0.006), access vintage 
      (p = 0.03), and residual diameter of AVF vein (p = 0.02) remain significantly linked 
      to pentosidine. Patients with pentosidine above median had higher cholesterol 
      (179.91 vs. 160.97, p = 0.04), triglycerides (187.18 vs. 129.31, p = 0.002) and 
      higher prevalence of hypertension (93.70% vs. 84.10%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggests that pentosidine could be associated to vascular access morphology 
      and function in dialysis patients.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is independently correlated to aortic 
      calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2679-85
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification has detrimental consequences on chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients, yet its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is involved in the regulation of mineral metabolism which 
      may in turn affect vascular calcification. Data on the relationship between FGF-23 
      and peripheral vascular calcification, using conventional radiographs, are 
      conflicting, and less is known about its relation to aortic calcification. We 
      conducted this study to investigate the relationship between FGF-23 and aortic 
      calcification in a standard haemodialysis setting. METHODS: The study included 65 
      haemodialysis patients (46 prevalent and 19 incident) on a three times 4-h dialysis 
      schedule as well as 15 controls. Those with diabetes, oral anticoagulation or 
      parathyroidectomy were excluded. Intact FGF-23, parathormone, lipids, calcium and 
      phosphorus were measured. Aortic calcification index (ACI) was assessed by a 
      non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) of the abdominal aorta. RESULTS: FGF-23 
      levels were higher among haemodialysis patients (4681.3 +/- 3906.1 pg/mL) compared 
      to controls (98.2 +/- 51.9 pg/mL), P = 0.005. ACI was higher in haemodialysis 
      patients (14.1 +/- 12) than controls (3.2 +/- 3.6), P = 0.009. FGF-23 (P < 0.0001) 
      and systolic blood pressure (BP) (P < 0.0001) were independently related to ACI in 
      stepwise multiple regression analysis of pooled analysis of haemodialysis patients, 
      R(2) = 0.476; in subgroup analysis, the independent factors relating to ACI among 
      prevalent dialysis patients were systolic BP (P < 0.0001), FGF-23 (P = 0.002) and 
      age (P = 0.012), R(2)=0.48; whereas in incident patients, only FGF-23 was associated 
      with ACI (P = 0.007), R(2) = 0.37. CONCLUSIONS: In haemodialysis patients, FGF-23 
      and ACI were significantly increased, and FGF-23 was independently associated with 
      aortic calcification.

TI  - Predictors of atherosclerotic events in patients on haemodialysis: post hoc analyses 
      from the AURORA study.
PG  - 102-112
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on haemodialysis (HD) are at high risk for cardiovascular 
      events, but heart failure and sudden death are more common than atherosclerotic 
      events. The A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatinin in Subjects on Regular 
      Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) trial was 
      designed to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction and death 
      from any cardiac cause in 2773 HD patients. We studied predictors of the 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in AURORA. METHODS: We readjudicated all 
      deaths and presumed myocardial infarctions according to the criteria used in the 
      Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP); these were specifically developed to 
      separate atherosclerotic from non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. The 
      readjudicated atherosclerotic end point included the first event of the following: 
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal and fatal 
      non-haemorrhagic stroke, coronary revascularization procedures and death from 
      ischaemic limb disease. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to identify the 
      predictors of such events. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 506 
      patients experienced the new composite atherosclerotic outcome. Age, male sex, 
      prevalent diabetes, prior cardiovascular disease, weekly dialysis duration, baseline 
      albumin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99 per g/L 
      increase], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04-1.22 per mg/L 
      increase) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HR 1.09; 95% CI 
      1.03-1.17 per 10 U/L increase) were selected as significant predictors in the model. 
      Neither LDL cholesterol nor allocation to placebo/rosuvastatin therapy predicted the 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the use of strict criteria for end point definition, 
      non-traditional risk factors, but not lipid disturbances, predicted atherosclerotic 
      events in HD patients.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene promoter 
      polymorphisms are associated with mortality in haemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major causes 
      of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a 
      family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in 
      atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of 
      atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G) and 
      MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery 
      calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) 
      and all-cause mortality risk in HD. METHODS: Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up 
      for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD 
      patients' characteristics were age 64 +/- 13 years, males 64%, diabetic 24%, 
      hypertensive 62%, smokers 38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all undergoing standard HD thrice 
      weekly. RESULTS: ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was 
      associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, diabetes, 
      hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage 
      and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for 
      the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 
      3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity 
      significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 
      (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first 
      time that MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors 
      for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. 
      These data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis 
      of the increased mortality in HD patients.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in bone and mineral metabolism after cessation of cinacalcet in 
      dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement 
      of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication 
      cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including 
      changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are 
      nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Dialysis 
      patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 
      2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the 
      time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical 
      outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve 
      dialysis patients. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age 
      was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of 
      cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 
      27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium 
      (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) 
      (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), 
      calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin 
      (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular 
      events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality 
      rate of 19% (n = 13). CONCLUSION: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet 
      withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium 
      and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

TI  - Fetuin-A and atherosclerotic calcified plaque in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 873-8
LID - 10.1016/j.metabol.2009.10.005 [doi]
AB  - Fetuin-A is a multifunctional circulating glycoprotein. Among its roles, inhibition 
      of ectopic calcification is a prominent feature. Low fetuin-A levels in dialysis 
      patients are associated with cardiovascular mortality, possibly via accelerating 
      vascular calcification. However, except for dialyzed conditions, a correlation 
      between fetuin-A levels and vascular calcification remains controversial. 
      Furthermore, any inhibitory effect of fetuin-A on atherosclerotic calcified plaques 
      (CPs) remains unclear compared with its effect on medial artery calcification that 
      is often found in dialyzed patients. Therefore, we examined the association between 
      fetuin-A levels and atherosclerotic CPs. For this study, 416 consecutive patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without renal dysfunction were examined. We 
      measured serum fetuin-A levels and investigated for the presence of CP in the common 
      carotid and femoral arteries using ultrasonography. Fetuin-A levels were 
      significantly lower in patients with CP than those without CP (262.6 +/- 56.7 and 
      281.5 +/- 64.6 microg/mL, respectively; P = .001). Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed that fetuin-A levels were inversely associated with the presence of 
      CP (odds ratio = 0.753; 95% confidence interval, 0.608-0.933; P = .010). These 
      results suggest that fetuin-A may inhibit the calcification of atherosclerotic 
      plaques independently of the dialyzed condition.

TI  - Low serum fetuin A levels and incident stroke in patients with maintenance 
      haemodialysis.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.1111/eci.12057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients, 
      is associated with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Whether it predicts stroke remains unknown. This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between fetuin A and incident stoke in maintenance HD 
      patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: This is a prospective 
      observational study. 238 prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean age, 60 
      ± 12 years) were followed up for the occurrence of stroke for 55 months. Baseline 
      circulating fetuin A levels, biochemical data and other markers of inflammation were 
      measured. The major outcome was the occurrence of incident ischaemic or haemorrhagic 
      stroke. RESULTS: Thirty one patients had incident strokes; an incidence of 38·4/1000 
      patient-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 36·5-39·8/1000 patient-years) on 
      follow-up. Patients in the lowest tertile of fetuin A concentration had highest risk 
      to have incident stroke (P < 0·001, log-rank test). By Cox proportional-hazards 
      regression, patients with higher fetuin A levels experienced lower incidence of 
      stroke, hazard ratio (HR) of 0·89 (95% CI, 0·84-0·96), while those with higher mean 
      arterial blood pressure had an HR of 1·19 (95% CI, 1·07-1·34) and those with higher 
      calcium phosphate product (CaxP) had an HR of 1·39 (95% CI, 1·1-1·73) for having 
      strokes. For patients without previous history of diabetes and cerebrovascular 
      disease, fetuin A deficiency also predicts the occurrence of incident stroke. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of incident stroke 
      among prevalent HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parathyroidectomy (PTx) decreases the mortality rate of refractory 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (rSHP) due to chronic kidney disease. A consensus 
      regarding which techniques of PTx are associated with better outcomes is not 
      available. The aims of this study are to evaluate the clinical and laboratory 
      evolution of 49 hemodialysis patients with rSHP who underwent PTx using different 
      techniques. METHODS: Patients underwent subtotal PTx (sub-PTx) or total PTx with 
      autotransplantation (AT) of 45 (PTx-AT(45)) or 90 parathyroid fragments (PTx-AT(90)) 
      and were followed for 12 months. We analyzed the expression of proliferating cell 
      nuclear antigen (PCNA), calcium-sensing receptor (CasR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), 
      fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), sodium-dependent phosphate 
      cotransporter-1 (PIT1), and Klotho in parathyroid glands. RESULTS: Baseline median 
      serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were 1,466 (1,087-2,125) pg/mL; 
      vascular calcification scores correlated with serum iPTH (r = 0.529; P = .002) and 
      serum phosphate levels (r = 0.389; P = .028); and Klotho expression was negatively 
      correlated with serum phosphate levels (r = -0.4; P = .01). After 12 months, serum 
      iPTH and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly controlled in all groups, as 
      was bone pain. The proportions of patients with serum iPTH levels within the ranges 
      recommended by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes were similar among the 
      treatment groups. During the hungry bone disease (HBS), patients received 3,786 g 
      (1,412-7,580) of elemental calcium, and a trend toward a positive correlation 
      between the cumulative calcium load at the end of follow up and VC score post-PTx 
      was noted (r = 0.390; P = .06). Two cases evolved to clinically uncontrolled 
      hyperparathyroidism in the sub-PTx group. The expression patterns of PCNA, VDR, 
      CasR, PIT1, FGFR1, and Klotho in parathyroid glands did not correlate with serum 
      systemic iPTH levels or the duration of HBS. CONCLUSIONS: All 3 operative techniques 
      were effective at controlling rSHP, both in clinical and laboratory terms. Neither 
      the quantity nor quality of parathyroid fragments influenced serum systemic iPTH and 
      AT-iPTH levels. The cumulative calcium load appeared to correlate with the VC score 
      and may have affected its progression. The effects of phosphate restriction on 
      Klotho expression in human parathyroid glands and the subsequent decrease in FGF23 
      resistance must be addressed in further studies.

TI  - Aortic calcifications and arterial stiffness as predictors of cardiovascular events

AB  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. 
      Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known CV risk 
      factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine the 
      prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We 
      conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar 
      X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 
      patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 
      32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV subgroup. When 
      we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 
      unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) 
      remained an independent predictor of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using 
      receiver operating characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV 
      events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC 
      are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR population. These 
      vascular assessments are readily available and easy to perform, making them ideal 
      tools for further risk stratification. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00547040).

TI  - Cerebral atrophy in patients on long-term regular hemodialysis treatment.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - The presence of Cerebral Atrophy in the form of cortical damage (Cortical Atrophy) 
      or subcortical damage (enlargement of ventricular cavities) was explored by computed 
      tomography (CT) scans in 30 patients maintained on regular hemodialysis treatment 
      (RDT) for not less than 10 years, and less than 50 years of age. Whereas a group of 
      50 normal subjects of the same age, used as control, gave no evidence of cerebral 
      atrophy, 46.6% of the patients maintained on RDT showed cortical atrophy, evenly 
      diffuse in half the cases and predominantly frontal in the other half. In addition 
      16.6% of the patients showed subcortical atrophy, even in the absence of evident 
      central neurologic or neuropsychic symptoms. In a search for the possible causes of 
      this high incidence of cerebral atrophy in chronic hemodialysis patients we reviewed 
      the last five years' profiles of clinical and blood biochemistry parameters known or 
      suspected to produce brain damage when altered, as stored in a computer system 
      available to our Hemodialysis Unit: these were mean blood pressure before and after 
      hemodialysis, blood cholesterol and triglyceride assays, and mean daily oral intake 
      of A1(OH)3. The status of arterial blood vessels in terms of vascular calcification 
      in soft tissue roentgenograms was also defined; then we correlated these clinical 
      and biochemical indices with the findings of cerebral CT scans by the Fisher test 
      and Discriminant Analysis. The Fisher test revealed a decreasing correlation of 
      cerebral atrophy with mean blood pressure, A1(OH)3 intake, blood cholesterol 
      content, arterial calcifications and blood trygliceride assay in that 
      order.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - A new peritoneal dialysis fluid for Japanese patients: a randomized non-inferiority 
      clinical trial of safety and efficacy.
PG  - 895-907
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1346-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report here two new peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs) for Japan [BLR 
      250, BLR 350 (Baxter Limited, Japan)]. The PDFs use two-chamber systems, and have 
      bicarbonate and lactate buffer to a total of 35 mmol/L. In separate trials, the new 
      PDFs were compared to two "standard" systems [PD-4, PD-2 (Baxter Limited, Japan)]. 
      The trials aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority of peritoneal creatinine clearance 
      (pCcr), peritoneal urea clearance (pCurea) and ultrafiltration volume (UF), and 
      compare acid-base and electrolyte balance. METHODS: We performed randomized, 
      multicenter, parallel group, controlled, open-label clinical trials in stable 
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The primary endpoints 
      were pCcr and UF. The secondary endpoints were serum bicarbonate and peritoneal urea 
      clearance. The active phase was 8 weeks. These trials were performed as 
      non-inferiority studies, with the lower limit of non-inferiority for pCcr and UF set 
      at 3.2 L/week/1.73 m(2) and 0.12 L/day, respectively. RESULTS: 108 patients (28 
      centers) and 103 patients (29 centers) took part in the two trials. Groups were well 
      balanced at baseline. The investigative PDFs were non-inferior to the "standard" 
      ones in terms of primary endpoints, comparable in terms of pCurea, and superior in 
      terms acid-base balance, especially correcting those with over-alkalinization at 
      baseline. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated fundamental functionality of two new PDFs and 
      showed superior acid-base balance. Given the propensity of Japanese CAPD patients 
      for alkalosis, it is important to avoid metabolic alkalosis which is associated with 
      increased cardiovascular mortality risk and accelerated vascular calcification. The 
      new PDFs are important progress of CAPD treatment for Japanese patients.

TI  - Prevention and management of hyperphosphatemia with sevelamer in Canada: health and 
      economic consequences.
PG  - 16-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) binds phosphate in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease without the use of exogenous calcium and may reduce the 
      progression of coronary vascular calcification. This intervention was shown to be 
      cost-effective in the United States. This paper presents the Canadian adaptation. 
      METHODS: A discrete event simulation of the long-term cardiovascular implications of 
      1 year of phosphate binding in a prevalent hemodialysis population was used to 
      estimate the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer use in Canada based on the 
      demographics, comorbidities, physiological and renal characteristics. Initial 
      calcification score and expected changes over 1 year were derived using regression 
      equations developed from a clinical trial and translated to cardiovascular disease 
      risk based on equations developed from a long-term cohort study. Direct medical 
      costs from a Canadian Medicare perspective were taken from Ontario data. Ten 
      replications of 10,000 patients over 13 years (discounting at 3%) were done for the 
      base case and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The 
      cardioprotective effect of sevelamer over 1 year is estimated to prevent 10 
      cardiovascular events and gain 18 life-years compared with calcium carbonate in 100 
      patients over a lifetime. These benefits are obtained at a net cost of CAD$2,096; an 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CAD$12,384 per discounted life-year gained. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that the time horizon and efficacy were the most 
      important factors. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence that use 
      of sevelamer in Canada would be economically sound.

      randomized crossover study.
PG  - 130
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-15-130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of cardiovascular disease is tremendously high in dialysis 
      patients. Dialysis patients treated with vitamin D analogs show decreased 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with untreated patients. We examined 
      the influence of two common vitamin D analogs, alfacalcidol and paricalcitol, on 
      important cardiovascular biomarkers in hemodialysis patients. Anti-inflammatory 
      effects and the influence on regulators of vascular calcification as well as markers 
      of heart failure were examined. METHODS: In 57 chronic hemodialysis patients 
      enrolled in a randomized crossover trial comparing paricalcitol and alfacalcidol, we 
      examined the changes in osteoprotegerin, fetuin-A, NT-proBNP, hs-Crp, IL-6 and 
      TNF-α, during 16 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: NT-proBNP and osteoprotegerin 
      increased comparably in the paricalcitol and alfacalcidol-treated groups. Fetuin-A 
      increased significantly in the alfacalcidol-treated group compared with the 
      paricalcitol-treated group (difference 32.84 μmol/l (95% C.I.; range 0.21-67.47)) 
      during the first treatment period. No difference was found between the groups during 
      the second treatment period, and IL-6, TNF-α and hs-Crp were unchanged in both 
      treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Paricalcitol and alfacalcidol modulate regulators of 
      vascular calcification. Alfacalcidol may increase the level of the calcification 
      inhibitor fetuin-A. We did not find any anti-inflammatory effect or difference in 
      changes of NT-proBNP. TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00469599 May 3 2007.

TI  - The circulating inactive form of matrix Gla Protein (ucMGP) as a biomarker for 
      cardiovascular calcification.
PG  - 427-36
LID - 10.1159/000124863 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matrix gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) protein (MGP) is a vitamin 
      K-dependent protein and a strong inhibitor of vascular calcification. Vitamin K 
      deficiency leads to inactive uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP), which accumulates at sites 
      of arterial calcification. We hypothesized that as a result of ucMGP deposition 
      around arterial calcification, the circulating fraction of ucMGP is decreased. Here 
      we report on the development of an ucMGP assay and the potential diagnostic utility 
      of monitoring serum ucMGP levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: An ELISA-based assay was 
      developed with which circulating ucMGP can be determined. Serum ucMGP levels were 
      measured in healthy subjects (n = 165) and in four patient populations; patients who 
      underwent angioplasty (n = 30), patients with aortic stenosis (n = 25), hemodialysis 
      patients (n = 52), and calciphylaxis patients (n = 10). All four patient populations 
      had significantly lower ucMGP levels. In angioplasty patients and in those with 
      aortic stenosis, some overlap was observed with the control population. However, in 
      the hemodialysis and calciphylaxis populations, virtually all subjects had ucMGP 
      levels below the normal adult range. CONCLUSION: Serum ucMGP may be used as a 
      biomarker to identify those at risk for developing vascular calcification. This 
      assay may become an important tool in the diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification.

TI  - Fondaparinux as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 3090-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft293 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated vascular calcification and increased risk of calciphylaxis 
      can be a reason to restrict the use of vitamin K antagonists in dialysis patients. 
      We describe the use of fondaparinux, a prototype indirect factor Xa inhibitor, as an 
      alternative anticoagulant to coumarin derivatives in dialysis patients. METHODS: In 
      this case series, we included six chronic haemodialysis patients treated with 
      vitamin K antagonists. Low-molecular-weight heparin given as anticoagulant during 
      dialysis was replaced by fondaparinux. Anti-Xa activity was regularly measured pre- 
      and postdialysis to adapt the dose of fondaparinux. Adequate continuous 
      anticoagulation and circuit patency were registered by evaluating clotting in the 
      bubble trap and dialyser membrane at the end of dialysis. RESULTS: Anticoagulation 
      with fondaparinux at a starting dose of 2.5 mg resulted in an effective 
      anticoagulation in the majority of dialysis sessions. Although median predialysis 
      anti-Xa levels were significantly lower [0.36 IU/mL (0.30-0.42 IU/mL) (P < 0.0001)] 
      than postdialysis levels [0.75 IU/mL (0.65-0.80 IU/mL)], predialysis anti-Xa levels 
      were sufficient to limit the risk of thromboembolism. After an initial period of 
      gradually increasing anti-Xa levels due to accumulation of fondaparinux, stable 
      levels were achieved. Haemodialysis without clotting problems was possible in 96% of 
      the sessions (clotting score ≤1), whereas two episodes (2/459 dialysis sessions) of 
      major clotting were observed, defined as clotting of the extracorporeal circuit 
      necessitating premature termination of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated 
      that fondaparinux is a valuable anticoagulant for patients dialysed with low-flux 
      membranes in need of continuous anticoagulation.

PG  - 997-1002
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in dialysis patients and 
      are associated with arterial stiffness and mortality. The use of simple and 
      inexpensive methods to evaluate arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications is 
      desired. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of a simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) with pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse 
      pressure (PP) and to evaluate their association with all-cause mortality. METHODS: 
      101 haemodialysis patients (71 men; 19% diabetic) were evaluated. At baseline, 
      arterial stiffness was measured by PP and by PWV with Complior. SVCS was evaluated 
      in plain X-ray of pelvis and hands. RESULTS: During a 43-month observational period, 
      31 patients died. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, SVCS >3 (P = 0.001), PP > 70 mmHg (P = 
      0.001) and PWV > 10.5 m/s (P < 0.001) were found to be associated with lower 
      cumulative survival. Adjusting for multiple variables, association with mortality 
      was maintained for SVCS >3 (HR = 3.308, P = 0.032) and PP > 70 mmHg (HR = 3.227, P = 
      0.031) in all patients and for PWV > 10.5 m/s (HR = 2.981, P = 0.047) in 
      non-diabetic patients. Age (P < 0.001), systolic pressure (P = 0.004) and SVCS > 3 
      (P = 0.032) were associated with PWV. Diabetes (P = 0.031), calcium carbonate dose 
      (P = 0.009) and SVCS > 3 (P = 0.012) were associated with PP. CONCLUSION: Higher 
      SVCS, PWV and PP were associated with higher mortality in this population. SVCS was 
      associated with arterial stiffness. Simple and inexpensive methods such as PP or 
      SVCS may be used to detect mortality risk and to provide important information that 
      may be relevant for guiding therapeutic intervention in dialysis patients.

PG  - 54-6
AB  - Fetuin A, 59 kDa protein, produced in the liver is a circulating inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification. The aim of the study was to estimate a concentration of 
      fetuin A in children with renal diseases. Fifty three children were examined: 18 
      with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) aged 2.5 to 14.5 years, mean 6.6 +/- 3.6 and 
      35 with chronic renal failure (CRF) aged 4.5 to 20 years, mean 13.3 +/- 3.9. The 
      control group (K) consisted of 22 healthy children, aged from 6.5 to 17.5 years, 
      mean 10.8 +/- 3.3. In all children serum concentration of fetuin A (ELISA method, 
      BioVendor), calcium (sCa), phosphorus (sP), protein (P), albumin (Alb), total 
      cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were measured. The daily protein excretion 
      in children with proteinuria (mg/kg/day) and the serum parathormone (PTH) level in 
      children with CRF were analysed. RESULTS: The concentration of fetuin A was the 
      lowest in children with NS (78.1 +/- 24.5 ng/ml) and was statistically different 
      (p=0.0003) than in group K (101.4 +/- 11 ng/ml) and group CRF (106.7 +/- 13.7 
      ng/ml). In group NS significant correlations were found between concentrations of 
      fetuin A and sCa (r=0.62, p<0.01), P (r=0.59, p= 0.01) and Alb (r=0.64, p<0.01) and 
      negative correlations with concentration of TC (r=-0.68, p<0.01) and daily 
      proteinuria (r=-0.79, p<0.001). In groups K and CRF the correlations of fetuin A 
      level and analysed parameters were not found. CONCLUSION: Low concentration of 
      fetuin A in children with nephrotic syndrome may be the additional agent to promote 
      the atherogenic lesions.

TI  - Successful management of critical limb ischemia with intravenous sodium thiosulfate 
      in a chronic hemodialysis patient.
PG  - 140-3
AB  - Vascular calcification is common among hemodialysis (HD) patients and contributes to 
      the development of peripheral arterial disease. A 57-year-old Japanese man who had 
      been on HD for 30 years was referred to us for severe pain with multiple ulcers on 
      his toes and fingers. He was an ex-smoker and had no diabetes mellitus. On 
      admission, he had ulcers on his big toes bilaterally and right 2nd - 4th fingers. 
      Peripheral pulses were strong and his ankle-brachial pressure index was above 1.3. 
      Laboratory data were as follows: calcium 9.9 mg/dl, albumin 3.3 g/dl, phosphate 3.0 
      mg/dl, Ca x P product 30, and parathyroid hormone 98 pg/ml. He had a 
      parathyroidectomy in 1998 and 1999. X-rays of his hands and legs showed diffuse 
      subcutaneous arteriolar calcification. Angiography revealed no local stenotic 
      lesions. Despite intensive therapies including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, painful 
      gangrene developed on his right big toe and the pain was so intense that he could 
      not go to sleep in a supine position. We infused intravenous sodium thiosulfate (20 
      g) 3 times weekly, based on previous reports. Within 4 - 5 days, he experienced 
      rapid and dramatic symptom relief. The score of the visual analogue pain scale 
      improved from 10/10 - 2/10. The signs of ischemia, measured by transcutaneous 
      partial oxygen pressure and thermography, improved significantly. During the 
      infusion of sodium thiosulfate, the patient complained of nausea, vomiting and 
      hyperosmia. These adverse symptoms were resolved after discontinuation of the 
      infusion. Pain relief was sustained and he could walk after 2 weeks of infusion. Our 
      case supports the use of sodium thiosulfate as a novel therapeutic choice for 
      critical limb ischemia with severe vascular calcification in chronic HD patients.

TI  - [Prevalence and functional effect of arteriovenous fistula calcifications, evaluated 
      by spiral CT in chronic haemodialysis patients].
PG  - 214-21

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was 
      to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous fistula 
      AVF (feeding artery and/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral 
      computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). PATIENTS 
      AND METHOD: Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%, mean duration 
      65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were evaluated by CT 
      in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F: 28.9%; mean time on HD 
      53.1 +/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF explorations were 
      performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual machine, GE 
      Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was quantified by CT using the 
      following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications, grade II isolated 
      calcifications (<10 groups of calcification), grade III moderate calcifications 
      (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (>20 groups of 
      calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid 
      hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The same week of CT scanning, 
      we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA 
      (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using 
      the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the 
      same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine, 
      Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded 
      simultaneous with QA. RESULTS: Most pts not showed AVF calcification by CT scan 
      (grade I: 27/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts (18/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF 
      calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III 8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial 
      AVF showed higher mean QA compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus 
      1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +/- 16.2 mmHg) 
      and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between 
      both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any 
      calcification on CT scanning (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 
      63.1 versus 24.6 +/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 
      +/- 61.2 months) and similar QA (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9 ml/min) 
      compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, 
      respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), 
      prevalence of brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were 
      found when comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were 
      obtained when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II: 
      73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and 
      without (grade I) AVF calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The prevalence of AVF 
      calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time on 
      HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis and 
      suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.

TI  - The effect of intravenous vitamin C on the phosphorus level reduction in 
      hemodialysis patients: a double blind randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - AIM: The majority of hemodialysis patients are hyperphosphatemic. Hyperphosphatemia 
      in these patients can lead to renal osteodystrophy, vascular calcification, 
      cardiovascular events, and is independently associated with mortality risk. The aim 
      of this study was to evaluate the effect of intravenous vitamin C on phosphorus 
      level in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Using a double blind randomized clinical 
      trial, a total of 60 qualified hemodialysis patients were randomly allocated in two 
      intervention and control groups and serum phosphorus, CRP, calcium, albumin and PTH 
      levels were measured. At the end of each hemodialysis session, intervention group 
      received vitamin C vial (500 mg/5 cc) intravenously three times a week for 8 weeks 
      and control group received normal saline in the same way. Data were collected before 
      and after two months of treatment. Data were analyzed using independent t-test, 
      paired t-test and chi-square test. RESULTS: Vitamin C treated group had a 
      significant decrease in phosphorus (p=0.01), CRP level (p=0.01) and Ca×P product 
      (p=0.03). In contrast, there was no significant difference in phosphorous (p= 0.5) 
      and CRP levels (p= 0.6) and Ca×P product (p=0.7) in the control group. In addition, 
      there was no statistically significant change in calcium (p=0.1), PTH (p=0.4) and 
      albumin (p=0.4) levels in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous vitamin C can 
      significantly decrease phosphorus level in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Role of fibroblast growth factor-23 in peripheral vascular calcification in 
      non-diabetic and diabetic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1506-13
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a recently identified circulating 
      factor that regulates phosphate (Pi) metabolism. Since the derangement of Pi control 
      is an important risk factor for vascular calcification, we investigated the 
      importance of plasma FGF-23 in the development of vascular calcification in the 
      aorta and peripheral artery in hemodialysis patients with and without diabetes 
      mellitus (DM). METHODS: Male hemodialysis patients with DM (n=32) and without DM 
      (n=56) were examined. Plasma samples were obtained before the start of dialysis 
      sessions, and the FGF-23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. Roentgenography of the aorta and hand artery was performed, and visible 
      vascular calcification was evaluated by one examiner, who was blinded to the patient 
      characteristics. RESULTS: In the 56 non-DM hemodialysis patients, vascular 
      calcification was found in the hand artery in 5 patients (8.9%) and in the aorta in 
      23 patients (41.1%). These levels were significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the 32 
      DM patients, of whom, 19 (59.4%) and 21 (65.6%) had vascular calcification of the 
      hand artery and aorta, respectively. Multiple regression analyses performed 
      separately in the non-DM and DM patients showed that the plasma FGF-23 level, CaxPi 
      product, and body weight are independent factors significantly associated with 
      hand-artery calcification and that diastolic blood pressure is associated with aorta 
      calcification in non-DM patients. In DM patients, the plasma FGF-23 level and 
      hemodialysis duration emerged as independent factors associated with hand-artery 
      calcification and diastolic blood pressure was associated with aorta calcification. 
      The independent association of the plasma FGF-23 level with hand-artery 
      calcification was retained in both non-DM and DM patients when adjusted for the 
      CaxPi product. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the plasma FGF-23 level is an 
      independent factor negatively associated with peripheral vascular calcification in 
      the hand artery, but not in the aorta, in both male non-DM and DM hemodialysis 
      patients, even when adjusted for the CaxPi product. This study raises the 
      possibility that the plasma FGF-23 level may provide a reliable marker for 
      Moenckeberg's medial calcification in male hemodialysis patients, independent of its 
      regulatory effect on Pi metabolism.

TI  - Progression of aortic arch calcification over 1 year is an independent predictor of 
      mortality in incident peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - e48793
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048793 [doi]
LID - e48793
AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: The presence and progression of vascular calcification have 
      been demonstrated as important risk factors for mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, since the majority of subjects included in most previous studies were 
      hemodialysis patients, limited information was available in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of 
      aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and prognostic value of AoAC progression in PD 
      patients. METHODS: We prospectively determined AoAC by chest X-ray at PD start and 
      after 12 months, and evaluated the impact of AoAC progression on mortality in 415 
      incident PD patients. RESULTS: Of 415 patients, 169 patients (40.7%) had AoAC at 
      baseline with a mean of 18.1±11.2%. The presence of baseline AoAC was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause [Hazard ratio (HR): 2.181, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.336-3.561, P = 0.002] and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.582, 95% CI: 
      1.577-8.132, P = 0.002). Among 363 patients with follow-up chest X-rays at 12 months 
      after PD start, the proportion of patients with AoAC progression was significantly 
      higher in patients with baseline AoAC (64.2 vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Moreover, all-cause 
      and cardiovascular death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups 
      than in the non-progression group (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that 
      AoAC progression was an independent predictor for all-cause (HR: 2.625, 95% CI: 
      1.150-5.991, P = 0.022) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 4.008, 95% CI: 
      1.079-14.890, P = 0.038) in patients with AoAC at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were independently 
      associated with unfavorable outcomes in incident PD patients. Regular follow-up by 
      chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in these 
      patients.

TI  - [Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone disorder].
PG  - 442-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney disease 
      in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic patients on 
      hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher prevalence of severe and 
      progressive vascular calcification with increased cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. The main factor which causes vascular calcification in patients with 
      diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic control. The recent trial findings 
      describe an inverse correlation between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum 
      levels and glycemic control in a group of diabetic patients on hemodialysis. AIM: 
      The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the laboratory 
      markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on glycemic 
      control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic compensation of 
      diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 
      3rd stage DKD were investigated. There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), 
      average age of patients was 71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l 
      and estimated glomerular filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 
      patients with better glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with 
      poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. 
      Patients were further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH 
      (iPTH < 35 pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis 
      was performed using and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We have found the statistical 
      significance in the serum phosphate and proteinuria levels in between groups with 
      HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 %. Diabetics with better glycemic control had 
      significant reduction in serum phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p 
      = 0.038) and in 24 hrs proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 
      0.007). In the group of presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found 
      the trend towards increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.063) and increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control of 
      diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD. KEY WORDS: diabetes 
      mellitus type 2 (DM2T) - chronic kidney disease (CKD) - mineral and bone disorder 
      (MBD).

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin levels predict cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and 
      deterioration of kidney function in type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
PG  - 2100-7
LID - 10.1007/s00125-008-1123-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The bone-related peptide osteoprotegerin is produced by vascular 
      cells and is involved in the process of vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the predictive value of plasma levels of osteoprotegerin in 
      relation to mortality, cardiovascular events and deterioration in kidney function in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This prospective observational follow-up 
      study included 397 type 1 diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (243 
      men; age [mean+/-SD] 42.1 +/- 10.6 years, duration of diabetes 28.3 +/- 9.9 years, 
      GFR 67 +/- 28 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(2)) and a group of 176 patients with longstanding 
      type 1 diabetes and persistent normoalbuminuria (105 men; age 42.6 +/- 9.7 years, 
      duration of diabetes 27.6 +/- 8.3 years). RESULTS: The median (range) follow-up 
      period was 11.3 (0.0-12.9) years. Among patients with diabetic nephropathy, 
      individuals with high osteoprotegerin levels (fourth quartile) had significantly 
      higher all-cause mortality than patients with low levels (first quartile) 
      (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.00 [1.24-7.27]). High osteoprotegerin levels 
      also predicted cardiovascular mortality (covariate-adjusted HR 4.88 [1.57-15.14]). 
      Furthermore, patients with high osteoprotegerin levels had significantly higher risk 
      of progression to end-stage renal disease than patients with low levels 
      (covariate-adjusted HR 4.32 [1.45-12.87]). In addition, patients with high levels of 
      plasma osteoprotegerin had an elevated rate of decline in GFR. 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High levels of osteoprotegerin predict all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, high 
      levels of osteoprotegerin predict deterioration of kidney function towards end-stage 
      renal disease.

TI  - Impact of lowering dialysate calcium concentration on serum bone turnover markers in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 909-16
AB  - Loss of renal function perturbs bone metabolism because kidney is a vital organ 
      maintaining homeostasis of calcium and phosphate. In hemodialysis patients, bone 
      diseases are serious complications resulting in fractures and extraosseous 
      calcification. The latest clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney 
      Foundation (New York, US) recommend a dialysate calcium concentration (D-Ca) of 2.5 
      mEq/L rather than 3.0 mEq/L to avoid excess calcium load and to prevent subsequent 
      vascular calcification. However, there is no perfect agreement yet about which 
      concentration should be chosen because lowering D-Ca might enhance uncoupled bone 
      resorption. Here, we studied effects of lowering D-Ca from 3.0 to 2.5 mEq/L on bone 
      metabolism in 67 patients. Doses of vitamin D and phosphate binders were kept 
      constant for a 2-month period beginning 1 month before the change in D-Ca, and were 
      adjusted thereafter. In group A [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) < 100 pg/ml 
      before the study], serum cross-linked N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen 
      (NTx) increased immediately after lowering D-Ca and then remained stable. Intact 
      osteocalcin (iOC) increased later along with iPTH, suggesting the improvement of 
      adynamic bone disease which shows a marked decrease in bone turnover without osteoid 
      accumulation. Vitamin D was not dosed up in this group. In group B (100 < or = iPTH 
      < 300), serum NTx increased transiently, which is followed by an increase of iOC but 
      not by a change of iPTH. In group C (300 < or = iPTH), lowering D-Ca allowed us to 
      increase the dose of vitamin D without hypercalcemia, leading to a significant 
      decrease in NTx and iPTH. Overall, serum phosphate increased from 5.4 +/- 1.6 to 6.1 
      +/- 1.6 mg/dL (P < 0.0001) and serum NTx increased by 1.5-fold (P < 0.0001) 1 month 
      after lowering D-Ca. Over a 3-month period after that, serum phosphate and serum NTx 
      decreased to their basal levels. These indicate that bone resorption predominated 
      over formation for only a short period. In conclusion, a D-Ca of 2.5 mEq/L with 
      adjustment of vitamin D ameliorates metabolic abnormalities of bone which develop 
      under 3.0 mEq/L.

TI  - Mineral metabolism, bone histomorphometry and vascular calcification in alternate 
      night nocturnal haemodialysis.
PG  - 224-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor control of bone mineral metabolism (BMM) is associated with renal 
      osteodystrophy and mortality in dialysis-dependent patients. The authors explored 
      the efficacy of alternate nightly home haemodialysis (ANHHD) in controlling BMM 
      parameters and its effects on bone mineral density and histomorphometry. METHODS: In 
      this prospective observational study, 26 patients on home haemodialysis (3-5 h, 
      3.5-4 sessions weekly) were converted to ANHHD (6-9 h, 3.5-4 sessions weekly). 
      Biochemical parameters of BMM at baseline, 6 and 12 months, radiological parameters 
      at baseline and 12 months and bone histomorphometry at 12 months are described. 
      RESULTS: Pre-dialysis serum phosphate fell from 2.13+/-0.65 to 1.38+/-0.35 mmol/L; 
      P<0.0001. No binders were required in 77.2% compared with 7.7% at baseline. 
      Calcium-phosphate product fell from 5.28+/-1.64 to 3.42+/-0.88 mmol2/L2; P<0.0001 
      and parathyroid hormone (PTH) from 301 (110-471) to 127 (47-240) ng/L; P=0.01. Bone 
      mineral density remained stable. Vascular and ectopic calcification improved or 
      stabilized in 87.5%. Bone histomorphometry at 12 months showed high, normal and low 
      bone turnover in 10, 3 and 4 patients, respectively, with 6/17 patients having 
      abnormal mineralization. CONCLUSION: Alternate nightly home haemodialysis 
      effectively manages biochemical parameters of BMM. Patients with very high PTH at 
      baseline (>1000 ng/L) did not significantly improve parathyroid hormone status. 
      Abnormal bone turnover and mineralization were present in a significant proportion 
      of patients at 12 months but low turnover was uncommon. Vascular calcification was 
      stabilized or improved in the majority. ANHHD compares favourably with every night 
      and short daily therapy in relation to BMM management and may offer lifestyle 
      advantages for patients.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification and arterial stiffness are independent factors for 
      diastolic left ventricular dysfunction in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1768-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in dialysis 
      patients, the correlation between diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and 
      arterial sclerosis, including thoracic aortic calcification, was studied in chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The enrolled study subjects were 
      142 (73 men, 69 women) maintenance HD patients. Aortic arch calcification volume 
      (AoACV) was measured by MDCT scan, arterial stiffness was estimated by 
      brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) and diastolic LV function was estimated as 
      E/E' by tissue Doppler imaging with cardiac ultrasonography. E/E' correlated 
      significantly with systolic blood pressure (r=0.29, p=0.037), age (r=0.19, p=0.02), 
      LV mass index (r=0.18, p=0.036), dialysis vintage (r=0.19, p=0.037), AoACV (r=0.37, 
      p<0.0001) and PWV (r=0.33, p=0.0002). Multiple regression analysis indicated that 
      AoACV (beta=0.26, p=0.005) and PWV (beta=0.22, p=0.03) were independent determinants 
      of E/E'. CONCLUSION: Diastolic LV dysfunction may be induced by increased vascular 
      calcification and reduced arterial stiffness in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification progression is associated with arterial stiffness and 
      cardiac repolarization deterioration in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 180-7
LID - 10.1159/000325656 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Evidence suggests that vascular calcification (VC) portends poor 
      cardiovascular (CV) prognosis in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis (CKD-5). 
      Nonetheless, how VC might predispose to CV mortality still remains to be clarified. 
      Herein, we report on the association between coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      progression and changes in cardiac repolarization as well as arterial stiffness. 
      METHODS: 132 patients new to dialysis were identified. Demographic and clinical 
      characteristics were collected at study entry and during the 12-month follow-up. 
      CAC, 12-lead ECG and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed at baseline and study 
      completion. Uni- and multivariable analyses were applied to detect factors 
      associated with worsening of cardiac repolarization (QTd) and arterial stiffness 
      (PWV). RESULTS: Uni- and multivariable analyses revealed that CAC progression was 
      associated with a significant increase in both QTd and PWV. Every 20-unit increase 
      in the CAC score corresponded to a significant 23% (95% CI 1.12-1.27; p < 0.001) and 
      32% (95% CI 1.09-1.37; p < 0.01) increase in the risk of experiencing a 1-m/s 
      increase in PWV and 1 ms in QTd, respectively. CONCLUSION: VC is a marker of 
      vasculopathy and appears to be associated with cardiac repolarization and arterial 
      stiffness abnormalities in CKD-5 patients.

TI  - The involvement of matrix glycoproteins in vascular calcification and fibrosis: an 
      immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 228-34
AB  - Calcification and fibrointimal proliferation are associated with advanced 
      complicated atherosclerosis in large arteries but may also occur in smaller vessels, 
      resulting in ischaemic tissue necrosis. This study investigates whether the 
      mechanisms of calcification and intimal fibrosis are similar in vessels of different 
      sizes. The localization of osteopontin (OPN), matrix Gla protein (MGP), 
      thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) was 
      investigated in three types of human vascular lesions: atherosclerosis, chronic 
      vascular rejection (CVR) in renal allografts, and calcific uraemic arteriolopathy 
      (calciphylaxis). These lesions were chosen as they affect different sized blood 
      vessels and they exhibit a fibroproliferative intimal reaction, with or without 
      calcification, resulting in luminal obliteration and ischaemic complications. OPN, 
      MGP, TSP-1, and COMP were not detected in normal blood vessels. However, OPN and MGP 
      were expressed at sites of calcification within atherosclerotic lesions and in 
      microvessels in calciphylaxis, suggesting that calcification in different sized 
      vessels may occur by a common mechanism. These proteins were not detected in areas 
      of fibrointimal proliferation. In contrast, TSP-1 was localized primarily within the 
      fibrous tissue of atherosclerotic lesions and was also expressed in the expanded 
      fibrous intima of arteries showing CVR. COMP was localized primarily within the 
      fibrous tissue under the lipid core of the majority of advanced atherosclerotic 
      lesions. TSP-1 and COMP were also detected in areas of microcalcification in 
      atherosclerotic lesions and TSP-1 was detected adjacent to areas of calcification in 
      calciphylaxis. However, neither TSP-1 nor COMP was localized to calcific foci within 
      these lesions. The localization of OPN, MGP, TSP-1, and COMP to pathological, but 
      not normal arterial intima supports a pathogenetic role for these proteins in the 
      development of vascular fibrosis and calcification. Modulation of their production 
      and activity may offer a novel approach to the therapy of a number of vascular 
      diseases.

      on hemodialysis.
PG  - 260-5
LID - S0066-782X2011005000027 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis present an increased risk of cardiovascular 
      death. Intimal media thickness (IMT) and presence of arterial calcifications are 
      well-known risk factors for cardiovascular death in hemodialysis patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of IMT and arterial calcifications in HD 
      patients and to correlate image findings with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study involving 75 patients on dialysis for >12 months. Patients 
      underwent B-mode ultrasound scan (US) for determination of IMT of the distal third 
      of the common carotid arteries. Arterial calcifications were assessed by US of 
      carotids, femoral and tibial arteries, and labeled positive if calcification was 
      found in any arterial site. RESULTS: Patients were 52±13 years old, 57% were males 
      and 16% were diabetics. IMT > 0.9 mm was found in 57% of cases and arterial 
      calcifications at US in 48%. Aging (decades) and smoking were associated with both 
      increased IMT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, p < 0.001; aOR = 4.4, p = 0.045, 
      respectively) and presence of vascular calcifications (aOR = 3.0, p < 0.001; aOR = 
      6.8, p = 0.011, respectively). High intact parathyroid hormone levels (per each 100 
      pg/ml) were significantly associated with increased IMT (aOR = 1.7, p = 0.021), but 
      not with vascular calcification. In contrast, Diabetes and time on dialysis (years) 
      were significant determinants for calcifications at US (aOR = 15.0, p = 0.009; aOR = 
      1.39, p = 0.020), but not for increased IMT. CONCLUSION: Increased IMT and 
      calcifications at US are common findings in hemodialysis patients. Aging and smoking 
      are consistent determinants for both image alterations. Parathyroid hormone 
      elevation is associated with increased IMT. Diabetes and time on dialysis 
      substantially increase the risk for arterial calcification.

TI  - Angiopoietin-2 levels predict mortality in CKD patients.
PG  - 1867-72
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of aggravated atherosclerosis in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) is still incompletely understood. However, there is an increasing 
      focus on non-traditional risk factors, including endothelial dysfunction. 
      Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) impairs endothelial function by inhibiting the binding of 
      Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) to their shared receptor Tie2 and is increased in diabetes, 
      hypertension, coronary heart disease and CKD. Furthermore, Ang-2 levels are 
      associated with the prevalent vascular burden of CKD patients. Thus, we aimed to 
      investigate its impact on outcome in CKD, the population most likely to die of 
      cardiovascular events. METHODS: We prospectively studied 128 CKD patients [43 CKD 
      Stage 4, 85 CKD Stage 5 (57 haemodialysis, 28 peritoneal dialysis)] over a follow-up 
      period of 4 years. Biochemical and clinical parameters, including objective scoring 
      of vascular calcification (VC) by computed tomography (CT) and arterial stiffness by 
      applanation tonometry (including radial-dorsalis pedis pulse wave velocity (PWVrd)) 
      were recorded. Baseline Ang-1 [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)], Ang-2 
      [immunoluminometric assay (ILMA)] and soluble Tie2 (sTie2) (ELISA) levels were 
      measured in this group as well as in 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: Ang-2 values were 
      significantly higher in CKD patients than in controls (2.01 ± 0.94 versus 1.00 ± 
      0.47 ng/mL, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, Ang-2 was significantly higher in dialysis 
      than in Stage 4 CKD patients and correlated with markers of vascular disease 
      [cholesterol, hsCRP, osteoprotegerin (OPG)]. However, elevated Ang-2 was not 
      associated with the degree of VC or with arterial stiffness. Cox-regression analysis 
      detected Ang-2 as an independent predictor of mortality in both unadjusted [hazard 
      ratio (HR) 1.15; P = 0.002] and models adjusted for age and VC (HR 1.14; P = 0.003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ang-2 levels are associated with systemic markers/mediators of 
      micro-inflammation in CKD patients. Furthermore, elevated Ang-2 levels are strong 
      predictors of long-term mortality, independent of conduit arterial stiffness or VC.

TI  - Risk factors of the progression of abdominal aortic calcification in patients on 
      chronic haemodialysis.
PG  - 2032-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is an independent determinant of cardiovascular 
      events in maintenance haemodialysis (HD) patients. It is not known whether acute 
      changes of the serum calcium concentration before and after HD (DeltaCa) are 
      associated with the development of aortic calcification. METHODS: We enrolled 71 
      patients dialysed with a dialysate with 3.0 mEq/l calcium and determined their 
      aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography twice at an 
      interval of 3 years. To identify the factors contributing to the rate of progression 
      of aortic calcification, we analysed the average values for clinical and laboratory 
      data obtained between the first and second evaluations of ACI. RESULTS: The second 
      ACI (mean+/-SD: 80.2+/-63.9) was significantly greater than the first ACI 
      (61.0+/-61.0) after an interval of 35.8+/-4.2 months. The annualized change of ACI 
      (DeltaACI/year) was significantly and directly associated with the DeltaCa and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) (both P<0.001, P for trend). Stepwise multivariate 
      regression analysis revealed that DeltaACI/year was positively and independently 
      associated with CRP, presence of diabetes mellitus and DeltaCa, but negatively 
      associated with a premenopausal status in women. Similarly, DeltaCa was positively 
      and independently associated with DeltaACI/year and the ultrafiltration rate, but 
      was negatively associated with pre-HD Ca. CONCLUSION: The increase of serum calcium 
      after HD was related to the rate of progression of aortic calcification. Excess 
      calcium is transferred into patients on HD when using a dialysate of 3.0 mEq/l 
      calcium. This may be a risk factor for the development of vascular calcification.

TI  - Determination and validation of aortic calcification measurement from lateral bone 
      densitometry in dialysis patients.
PG  - 119-27
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03410708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to increased 
      cardiovascular (CV) disease in dialysis patients and is inversely correlated with 
      bone mineral density (BMD). Screening for VC may determine patients at greater CV 
      risk and bone densitometry may have dual role in assessing VC as well as BMD. The 
      aim of this study was to determine measurement of VC using dual-energy x-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA) with correlation to gold standard computed tomography (CT). 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Forty hemodialysis patients had 
      abdominal aortic CT and lateral DXA of lumbar spine to determine aortic VC and BMD. 
      Semiquantitative measurement of aortic VC from lateral DXA was determined using 
      previously validated 24- and 8-point scales and correlated with aortic VC with CT. 
      Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral DXA-reported BMD was compared with BMD from L2 
      through L4 with CT. RESULTS: Patients, 70% men, 38% diabetic, had median age 58.5 
      yr. Aortic VC was present in 94% with CT and 68% on lateral DXA. For 24- and 8-point 
      scores, intraclass correlation coefficients for intrarater agreement were 0.93 and 
      0.88, respectively. DXA-measured VC correlated with CT. Sensitivity and specificity 
      for CT aortic VC > or = 500 HU was 50 and 86%, respectively, for DXA VC > or = 6 on 
      a 24-point scale. Lateral DXA-reported BMD significantly correlated with BMD from 
      CT, but AP DXA did not. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral DXA may be useful because images may 
      provide concurrent assessment of aortic calcification as well as more accurate 
      lumbar spine BMD, avoiding some of the limitations of AP DXA.

TI  - Phosphate binder impact on bone remodeling and coronary calcification--results from 
      the BRiC study.
PG  - c273-83
LID - 10.1159/000170783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Calcium-containing phosphate binders have been shown to 
      increase the progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This is 
      a prospective study that compares the effects of calcium acetate and sevelamer on 
      coronary calcification (CAC) and bone histology. METHODS: 101 hemodialysis patients 
      were randomized for each phosphate binder and submitted to multislice coronary 
      tomographies and bone biopsies at entry and 12 months. RESULTS: The 71 patients who 
      concluded the study had similar baseline characteristics. On follow-up, the 
      sevelamer group had higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone (498 +/- 352 vs. 326 
      +/- 236 pg/ml, p = 0.017), bone alkaline phosphatase (38 +/- 24 vs. 28 +/- 15 U/l, p 
      = 0.03) and deoxypyridinoline (135 +/- 107 vs. 89 +/- 71 nmol/l, p = 0.03) and lower 
      LDL cholesterol (74 +/- 21 vs. 91 +/- 28 mg/dl, p = 0.015). Phosphorus (5.8 +/- 1.0 
      vs. 6 +/- 1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.47) and calcium (1.27 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.68) levels did not differ between groups. CAC progression (35 vs. 24%, p = 
      0.94) and bone histological diagnosis at baseline and 12 months were similar in both 
      groups. Patients of the sevelamer group with a high turnover at baseline had an 
      increase in bone resorption (eroded surface, ES/BS = 9.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.1 +/- 9.5%, 
      p = 0.05), whereas patients of both groups with low turnover at baseline had an 
      improvement in bone formation rate (BFR/BS = 0.015 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.062 +/- 0.078, p 
      = 0.003 for calcium and 0.017 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.071 +/- 0.084 microm(3)/microm(2)/day, 
      p = 0.010 for sevelamer). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in CAC progression or 
      changes in bone remodeling between the calcium and the sevelamer groups.

TI  - Peripheral vascular calcification in long-haemodialysis patients: associated factors 
      and survival consequences.
PG  - 948-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with 
      numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension 
      and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD 
      patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of 
      sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and 
      effects on the 1-year survival rate. METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre 
      using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and 
      extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to 
      their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological 
      data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, 
      beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year 
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the 
      centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects 
      were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 
      months (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l 
      dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients 
      were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were 
      classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, 
      more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 
      'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and 
      low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
      FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a 
      score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to 
      patients with a 0 score. CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high 
      prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis 
      strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic 
      factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure 
      and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association 
      with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The 
      harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and 
      optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD 
      patients.

TI  - Association of fetuin-A and cardiac calcification and inflammation levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.3109/00365513.2010.528445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is commonly found in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients and it is one of the predictors of cardiovascular death. Recently, several 
      studies have demonstrated that low fetuin-A levels are associated with mortality in 
      uremic patients. Objectives. To investigate the importance of non-traditional risk 
      factors of calcification including fetuin-A, IL-6 and high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) 
      in hemodialysis patients and their relationship to the extent of cardiac 
      calcification by means of multislice computed tomography (MSCT), and 
      echocardiography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 70 hemodialysis 
      patients as well as 20 healthy control subjects. All patients were subjected to MSCT 
      for evaluation of calcium score in the coronary arteries as well as echocardiography 
      for detecting valvular calcification. In addition, the patients were sampled for 
      evaluation of inflammatory markers such as hsCRP and IL-6 and also fetuin-A. 
      RESULTS: Mean serum fetuin-A was significantly lower in hemodialysis patients than 
      controls subjects. By dividing the patients into tertiles of serum fetuin-A, a 
      significant association between low levels of fetuin-A and high calcium score and 
      valvular calcification were found. Multiple regression analysis showed that calcium 
      scoring and IL-6 were the most independent risk factors for serum fetuin-A levels. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum fetuin-A showed important association with coronary, valvular 
      calcification and inflammation in hemodialysis patients. Assessment of both cardiac 
      calcification and serum levels of fetuin-A may be of value to identify those 
      subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular lesion and may be 
      a novel therapeutic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteinuria is a marker of graft damage and is closely associated with a 
      higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant 
      recipients (KTRs). Arterial stiffness is a well-known predictor of vascular 
      calcification and systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate 
      the association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to determine 
      whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular disease in our KTR 
      population. METHODS: Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 ± 11 years, with 45.9 ± 9.6 
      months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in the 3 to 5 years 
      of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All patients were evaluated for 
      their standard clinical (age, sex, and duration of hemodialysis) parameters. 
      High-grade proteinuria was defined as proteinuria >500 mg/day in the 24-hour urine 
      collection. All patients were evaluated by means of pulse-wave velocity (PWV) 
      measurement at the initiation of the study. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 
      groups: group 1 (high-grade proteinuria) patients with ≥500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and 
      group 2 (low-grade proteinuria) patients with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60). High-grade 
      proteinuria was correlated with higher PWV measurements and lower estimated 
      glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria appears to precede the elevation of serum 
      creatinine and thus may be a useful marker of renal injury and may also be a 
      contributing factor on deterioration of the graft. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade (>500 
      mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly associated with poor graft survival and 
      increased risk of cardiovascular events. In our study, we proved the significant 
      difference between high-grade and low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 
      mg/day as the threshold of proteinuria in KTR population.

TI  - Risk factors associated with coronary artery calcification should be examined before 
      kidney transplantation.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney 
      transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher incidence 
      of cardiovascular events compared with general population. Cardiovascular risk 
      factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of patients starting dialysis 
      or kidney transplantation already have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery 
      calcification is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions 
      and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 
      stable renal transplant recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk 
      factors associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and 
      quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients 
      and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were 
      significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients 
      without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than 
      those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 
      23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients 
      died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC 
      score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with 
      atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.

TI  - The relationship between serum osteopontin and FGF 23 levels with valvular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients .
PG  - 9-16
LID - 10.5414/CN109505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Cardiovascular calcification is an important cause of 
      morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Vascular and valvular 
      calcification are indicators of increased tissue calcification. The relationship of 
      osteopontin (OPN) - which is known as a vascular calcification inhibitor - and 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) - which its related to vascular calcification, 
      as recently shown - to valvular calcification is unknown. In this cross-sectional 
      study, we examined the relationship between heart valve calcification, serum OPN, 
      and FGF-23 levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 85 adults who were on HD treatment for at 
      least 6 months were included in the study. Echocardiographic evaluation was made 
      with the General Electric echocardiography device and the same cardiologist. FGF-23 
      and osteopontin levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: 54% of our patients were 
      male, mean age was 49.8 ± 15.1 years, and mean HD duration was 52.5 ± 39.6 months. 
      34% of the patients were diabetic, and 17.6% had a history of coronary artery 
      disease. 1.25 mmol/L calcium were used as dialysate calcium in 84.7% of the 
      patients. 60% of the patients were on vitamin D replacement therapy, and 7.1% were 
      receiving cinacalcet treatment. Valvular calcification ratio of the patients was 
      44%. Mean FGF-23 level was 682 ± 771.7 pg/mL, and mean OPN level was 
      22.2 ± 8.2 ng/mL. When the patients with and without heart valve calcification were 
      compared, the group with heart valve calcification was older and had lower serum OPN 
      levels. There were differences between the groups on left atrial diameters, left 
      ventricular end-diastolic diameters, and posterior-wall thicknesses. In the logistic 
      regression analysis, it was seen that age and serum OPN levels were predictors of 
      valvular calcification. CONCLUSION: Serum osteopontin level is associated with heart 
      valve calcification in HD patients, but there was no relationship found with FGF-23. 
      Further research is needed on the subject. .

TI  - Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by-stander, 
      but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in 
      vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline 
      phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
      RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
      were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
      phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with 
      older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher 
      serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone 
      levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but 
      the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate 
      time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of serum alkaline 
      phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone 
      metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase 
      was significantly associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 
      95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 
      1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in 
      hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. 
      Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Factors involved in vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in maintenance 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 515-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcifications are common causes of 
      morbidity and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis patients. In addition to the 
      well-known traditional risk factors, uraemia-specific factors appear to enhance 
      dramatically the progression of the pathological processes involved. The aim of the 
      present study was to evaluate the degree of atherosclerosis and vascular 
      calcifications in chronic haemodialysis patients using non-invasive imaging methods, 
      and to identify potentially involved factors. METHODS: The study included 73 
      patients (36 females, 37 males), aged 25-75 years, who were on haemodialysis 
      treatment for 12-275 months (mean dialysis vintage 73.8 months). We assessed the 
      following circulating parameters: calcium (Ca), phosphorus, 'intact' parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH), 25OH vitamin D, lipids, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), Lp(a), homocysteine, 
      leptin, IL-1-beta, IL-6, CRP, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, (PDGF), advanced oxidation 
      protein products (AOPP) and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO). Coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) was assessed using multi-row spiral CT (MSCT). 
      Intima-media thickness index of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) and presence of 
      cervical artery atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated by ultrasonography. RESULTS: 
      Coronary artery calcifications were observed in 79.5% of the patients, with CACS 
      ranging from 0 to 4987. In univariate analysis, a positive correlation was observed 
      between CACS and age, BMI, iPTH, CRP, IL-6 and CCA-IMT, whereas an inverse 
      correlation existed with 25OH vitamin D, TGF-beta and PDGF. CCA-IMT ranged from 0.4 
      to 1.1 mm. It was positively correlated, in univariate analysis, with age, CACS, CRP 
      and Il-6, and negatively with 25OH vitamin D, TGF-beta and PDGF. Only CACS remained 
      as independent predictive factor of CCA-IMT in multivariate analysis. 
      Atherosclerotic plaques were found in the carotid arteries of 53 patients (72%). The 
      number of plaques was positively correlated with age, CACS, phosphorus, MPO, CRP and 
      IL-6, and inversely with 25OH vitamin D in univariate analysis. In multivariate 
      regression analysis, only age and CACS remained as independent variables. 
      CONCLUSION: In addition to classic risk factors, the degree of atherosclerosis and 
      vascular calcification in our dialysis patient population were associated with 
      several factors that are frequently abnormal in advanced chronic renal failure, but 
      except age, all of them were interdependent. Notably, as in the general population, 
      CACS was an independent predictor of the degree of atherosclerosis in haemodialysis 
      patients.

AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease. 
      Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) can be detected by X-ray, although AAC is less 
      well documented in anatomical distribution and severity compared with coronary 
      calcification. Using simple radiological imaging we aimed to assess AAC and 
      determine associations in prevalent Australian haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 
      Lateral lumbar X-ray of the abdominal aorta was used to determine AAC, which is 
      related to the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1 to L4. 
      Two radiologists determined AAC scores, by semi-quantitative measurement using a 
      validated 24-point scale, on HD patients from seven satellite dialysis centres. 
      Regression analysis was used to determine associations between AAC and patient 
      characteristics. RESULTS: Lateral lumbar X-ray was obtained in 132 patients. Median 
      age of patients was 69 years (range 29-90), 60% were male, 36% diabetic, median 
      duration of HD 38 months (range 6-230). Calcification (AAC score ≥ 1) was present in 
      94.4% with mean AAC score 11.0 ± 6.4 (median 12). Independent predictors for the 
      presence and severity of calcification were age (P = 0.03), duration of dialysis (P 
      = 0.04) and a history of cardiovascular disease (P = 0.009). There was no 
      significant association between AAC and the presence of diabetes or time-averaged 
      serum markers of mineral metabolism, lipid status and C-reactive protein. 
      CONCLUSIONS: AAC detected by lateral lumbar X-ray is highly prevalent in our cohort 
      of Australian HD patients and is associated with cardiovascular disease, increasing 
      age and duration of HD. This semi-quantitative method of determining vascular 
      calcification is widely available and inexpensive and may assist cardiovascular risk 
      stratification.

TI  - Plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 and mineral metabolism in diabetic and 
      non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 1067-74
LID - 10.1007/s11255-008-9462-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a circulating factor that regulates 
      phosphate (P) metabolism. Since higher P levels are associated with vascular 
      calcification, we examined the role of serum FGF-23 levels in P metabolism and 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients with and without diabetes 
      mellitus (DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic HD patients with DM (n = 39) and 
      without DM (n = 50) were enrolled. Serum samples were obtained before the start of 
      dialysis sessions, and the FGF-23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, and the 
      aortic calcification index (ACI) was determined by one examiner, blinded to the 
      patient characteristics. Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) were performed 
      at the time of ACI estimation. RESULTS: Log plasma FGF-23 levels were higher in 
      non-DM (3.74 +/- 0.71 pg/ml) than in DM (3.35 +/- 0.74 pg/ml) patients. The log 
      FGF-23 correlated positively with serum creatinine (r = 0.424, P < 0.0001), albumin 
      (r = 0.225, P = 0.0337), Ca (r = 0.392, P = 0.0001), P (r = 0.735, P < 0.0001), and 
      Ca x P product (r = 0.780, P < 0.0001). There were negative correlations between log 
      FGF-23 and age (r = -0.208, P = 0.0497), glucose (r = -0.231, P = 0.0294), and CRP 
      (r = -0.222, P = 0.0359). Multiple regression analyses were performed to explore the 
      correlations between plasma FGF-23 and other factors associated with vascular 
      calcification in all HD patients. Independent variables were selected based on the 
      results of univariate analyses. The significant factors associated with FGF-23 in HD 
      patients were age, serum levels of creatinine, albumin, glucose, Ca, P, and Ca x P 
      product. Plasma FGF levels did not correlate significantly with either ACI or BMD in 
      these patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the plasma FGF-23 level is 
      associated with calcium-phosphate metabolism disorders, but not with aortic 
      calcification, in both non-DM and DM patients on chronic HD. In addition, plasma 
      FGF-23 is associated with serum levels of creatinine and albumin. Therefore, the 
      plasma FGF-23 level may provide a reliable marker for Ca and P imbalance and 
      nutritional status in HD patients.

TI  - Evaluation of serum fetuin-A relationships with biochemical parameters in patients 
      on hemodialysis.
PG  - 304-308
LID - 10.1007/s10157-007-0499-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complications associated with atherosclerosis in dialysis patients are 
      attracting attention. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that 
      inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation and outcome in 
      dialysis patients. In this study, the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration 
      and biochemical parameters in patients on hemodialysis was investigated. METHODS: 
      Forty hemodialysis patients, 22 men and 18 women, aged 57 +/- 12 years; and 20 
      controls, 10 men and 10 women, aged 50 +/- 10 years, participated in this study. We 
      measured serum fetuin-A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biochemical 
      parameters of serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphate, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein (a), brain 
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hemoglobin, 
      and hematocrit in whole blood were also measured before starting dialysis sessions. 
      Other parameters included the cardio ankle vascular index, age, mean arterial 
      pressure, total weekly urea clearance (Kt/V), smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), 
      and duration of dialysis. These variables were included in simple regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: Levels of serum fetuin-A in the hemodialysis patients (331 +/- 55 
      microg/ml) were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (361 +/- 55 
      microg/ml; P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between serum fetuin-A levels 
      and duration of dialysis (r = -0.37, P < 0.01), BNP (r = -0.37, P < 0.001), and 
      hsCRP (r = -0.40, P < 0.01), and a positive association with serum albumin (r = 
      0.31, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a low fetuin-A level is a 
      useful predictor of malnutrition and inflammation, as well as being a useful 
      predictor of the cardiac failure caused by an increased ventricular load in 
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - [Is there a correlation between C-reactive protein and calcification inhibitors with 
      cardiovascular parameters and risk factors in hemodialysis patients?].
PG  - 1820-4
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients on hemodialysis exhibit a drastically increased 
      cardiovascular mortality. Inflammation, hyperphosphatemia and lack of calcification 
      inhibitors are uremia-associated risk factors for vascular calcification. Functional 
      and morphological vascular parameters are used to assess cardiovascular risk. The 
      aim of our study was to analyse the relation between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
      intima-media-thickness (IMT) with calcification inhibitors. METHODS: A cohort of 97 
      hemodialysis patients was consecutively selected and investigated (age 56 +/- 9 
      years). Carotid-femoral PWV, carotid IMT, left ventricular ejection fraction and 
      septum thickness were determined. These parameters were correlated with serum levels 
      of CRP and calcification inhibitors (fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin [OPG]). RESULTS: 
      Both PWV and IMT showed a positive correlation with age and systolic blood pressure 
      and a negative correlation with Kt/V (dialysis efficiency). Additionally, fetuin-A 
      was negatively associated with CRP and positively with cholesterol and 
      triglycerides. Serum levels of the calcification inhibitors fetuin-A and OPG were 
      not correlated to PWV or IMT. CONCLUSION: The lack of correlation of calcification 
      inhibitors with PWV and IMT means that functional and morphological measurements of 
      vascular properties can not necessarily be replaced by analysing "biomarkers".

TI  - Dialysate calcium concentration and the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 797-803
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10000912 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The optimal dialysate calcium concentration to maintain 
      normal mineralization and reduce risk of cardiovascular events in hemodialysis 
      patients is debated. Guidelines suggest that dialysate Ca concentration should be 
      lowered to avoid vascular calcification, but cardiac arrhythmias may be more likely 
      to occur at lower dialysate Ca. Concurrent use of QT-prolonging medications may also 
      exacerbate arrhythmic risk. This study examined the influence of serum Ca, dialysate 
      Ca, and QT interval-prolonging medications on the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in a 
      cohort of hemodialysis patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This 
      case-control study among 43,200 hemodialysis patients occurred between 2002 and 
      2005; 510 patients who experienced a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest were compared 
      with 1560 matched controls. This study examined covariate-adjusted sudden cardiac 
      arrest risk associations with serum Ca, dialysate Ca, serum dialysate Ca gradient, 
      and prescription of QT-prolonging medications using logistic regression techniques. 
      RESULTS: Patients assigned to low Ca dialysate<2.5 mEq/L were more likely to be 
      exposed to larger serum dialysate Ca gradient and had a greater fall in BP during 
      dialysis treatment. After accounting for covariates and baseline differences, low Ca 
      dialysate<2.5 mEq/L (odds ratio=2.00, 95% confidence interval=1.40-2.90), higher 
      corrected serum Ca (odds ratio=1.10, 95% confidence interval=1.00-1.30), and 
      increasing serum dialysate Ca gradient (odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence 
      interval=1.10-1.80) were associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest, 
      whereas there were no significant risk associations with QT-prolonging medications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest associated with low Ca 
      dialysate and large serum dialysate Ca gradients should be considered in determining 
      the optimal dialysate Ca prescription.

TI  - The effects of sevelamer and calcium acetate on proxies of atherosclerotic and 
      arteriosclerotic vascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently determined that in hemodialysis patients, the use of calcium 
      salts to correct hyperphosphatemia led to progressive coronary artery and aortic 
      calcification as determined by sequential electron beam tomography (EBT) while the 
      use of the non-calcium-containing binder sevelamer did not. Whether the specific 
      calcium preparation (acetate vs. carbonate) might influence the likelihood of 
      progressive calcification was debated. METHODS: To determine whether treatment with 
      calcium acetate was specifically associated with hypercalcemia and progressive 
      vascular calcification, we conducted an analysis restricted to 108 hemodialysis 
      patients randomized to calcium acetate or sevelamer and followed for one year. 
      RESULTS: The reduction in serum phosphorus was roughly equivalent with both agents 
      (calcium acetate -2.5 +/- 1.8 mg/dl vs. sevelamer -2.8 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.53). 
      Subjects given calcium acetate were more likely to develop hypercalcemia (defined as 
      an albumin-corrected serum calcium > or =10.5 mg/dl) (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.015). 
      Treatment with calcium acetate (mean 4.6 +/- 2.1 g/day - equivalent to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g 
      of elemental calcium) led to a significant increase in EBT-determined calcification 
      of the coronary arteries (mean change 182 +/- 350, median change +20, p = 0.002) and 
      aorta (mean change 181 +/- 855, median change +73, p < 0.0001). These changes were 
      similar in magnitude to those seen with calcium carbonate. There were no significant 
      changes in calcification among sevelamer-treated subjects. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      purported differences in safety and efficacy relative to calcium carbonate, calcium 
      acetate led to hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Relation of oral 1alpha-hydroxy vitamin D3 to the progression of aortic arch 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1007/s00380-009-1151-4 [doi]
AB  - The role of decreased active vitamin D levels on vascular calcification has not been 
      elucidated in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to 
      evaluate the relationship between progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) 
      and prescribed dose of 1alpha-hydroxy vitamin D. The enrolled study subjects were 65 
      (40 men and 25 women) HD patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was 
      semiquantitatively estimated with a score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change 
      in AoACS (DeltaAoACS) was obtained by subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the 
      follow-up AoACS value. The second assessment was performed from 2 years after the 
      first determination. The nonprogressors (63.2 +/- 14.5 years) were significantly 
      younger than the progressors (68.2 +/- 10.8 years) (P = 0.0419). In addition, 
      prescribed dose of 1alpha-hydroxy vitamin D3 was significantly higher in the 
      nonprogressors (125.5 +/- 109.1 microg) than progressors (84.8 +/- 81.1 microg) (P = 
      0.0371). Multiple regression analysis revealed prescribed dose of 1alpha-hydroxy 
      vitamin D(3) (beta value = -0.324, P = 0.0051) as well as DBP (beta value = -0.418, 
      P = 0.007), serum levels of P (beta value = 0.333, P = 0.006) and C-reactive protein 
      (beta value = 0.237, P = 0.0048) to be significant independent determinants of 
      DeltaAoACS. In conclusion, the evaluation of AoACS on chest radiography is a very 
      simple tool in HD patients. Active vitamin D therapy seems to protect patients from 
      developing vascular calcification.

TI  - Aortic calcification in haemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 2472-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain metabolic disorders, such as hyperphosphatemia induce vascular 
      calcification in haemodialysis patients; it is unclear, however, whether these 
      disorders contribute to aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients. 
      This study examined the risk factors of aortic calcification in a large number of 
      haemodialysis patients, and compared risk factors between diabetic and non-diabetic 
      patients. METHODS: The subjects were 667 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 184 
      with type 2 diabetes and 483 without. Aortic calcification was measured 
      semi-quantitatively using a plain computed tomography image of the abdominal aorta, 
      and an aortic calcification index (ACI) was calculated. RESULTS: The ACI of the 
      diabetic subjects was significantly higher than that of those without diabetes 
      (57.3+/-22.1 vs 44.8+/-28.3%, P < 0.0001), although the dialysis vintage of the 
      former was significantly shorter (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed 
      that diabetes was a significant independent risk factor for increased ACI. Multiple 
      regression analyses, performed separately in diabetics and non-diabetics, revealed 
      that advanced age, higher systolic blood pressure, smoking and longer haemodialysis 
      vintage were common independent risk factors significantly associated with increased 
      ACI in both patient groups (R2 = 0.296, P < 0.0001 for non-diabetics; R2 = 0.193, P 
      < 0.0001 for diabetics). Higher serum phosphate concentration was not significantly 
      associated with increased ACI in diabetic patients (P = 0.429), although it was a 
      significant independent factor in non-diabetic patients (beta = 0.150, P < 0.0005). 
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients is more 
      advanced, compared with non-diabetic patients, even with short haemodialysis 
      vintage. Since disorders of mineral metabolism are not significantly associated with 
      aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients, aortic calcification in 
      these patients could be affected by metabolic abnormalities associated with the 
      diabetic state per se, independent of other confounding factors; and aortic 
      calcification may be advanced even before haemodialysis induction.

TI  - Successful treatment of calcific uremic arteriolopathy in a pediatric dialysis 
      patient.
PG  - 357-62
LID - 10.1007/s00467-009-1313-8 [doi]
AB  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare, life-threatening disease, typically 
      affecting patients with end-stage renal disease. It is characterized by widespread 
      vascular calcification, endothelial fibrosis and end-organ ischemia. The mortality 
      rate is high with infection and sepsis being the most common causes of death. Common 
      therapies include restoration of calcium and phosphorous homeostasis, wound care and 
      pain control. Although soft tissue calcification is a known complication in children 
      with advanced renal disease, the incidence of CUA in pediatrics remains unknown. 
      Additionally, current literature regarding its management in pediatric patients is 
      lacking. We report the case of a 17-year-old African-American male patient with 
      end-stage renal disease secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis who developed CUA 
      after 3 years on peritoneal dialysis. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate (STS) and 
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy alone was ineffective, forcing the patient to 
      undergo bilateral below the-knee-amputation (BKA) 5 months after presentation. It 
      was not until peritoneal dialysis had been changed to daily hemodialysis, while 
      continuing STS and HBO therapy, that the patient demonstrated complete resolution of 
      CUA on repeat bone scan. Based on these findings, and the extremely high mortality 
      rate associated with this disease, CUA management requires early and aggressive 
      intervention with multi-faceted therapy, including prompt conversion from peritoneal 
      dialysis to hemodialysis, STS infusions and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin is associated with mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 262-70
AB  - Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of vascular smooth 
      muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular calcifications are a bioactive 
      process. Regulating molecules such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator 
      of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) could play a key role in bone-vascular calcification 
      imbalance. This study investigated the contribution of these proteins as well as 
      mineral metabolism disorders in hemodialysis (HD) patient outcome. A total of 185 HD 
      patients were followed up prospectively for 2 yr. In addition to clinical 
      characteristics, mineral metabolism markers as well as OPG and soluble RANKL 
      (sRANKL) were measured at baseline. After 2 yr, survival rates were described with 
      Kaplan-Meier and compared with Cox regression analyses; 50 patients died (27 from 
      cardiovascular diseases). Calcium, phosphate, and calcium x phosphate product were 
      not associated with mortality. Both hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone > or 
      =300 pg/ml) and hypoparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone <150 pg/ml) were poorly 
      associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. By contrast, elevated OPG 
      levels predicted all-cause (relative risk [RR] 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.32 to 5.41; P = 0.006) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 3.15; 95% CI 1.14 to 8.69; 
      P = 0.03). Low levels of sRANKL were associated with a protective effect for 
      all-cause mortality (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.94; P = 0.03). The association of OPG 
      with all-cause mortality was stronger in patients with C-reactive protein > or 
      =12.52 mg/L. In this condition, both highest (RR 5.68; 95% CI 1.48 to 22.73; P = 
      0.01) and lowest tertiles (RR 5.37; 95% CI 147 to 1968; P = 0.01) significantly 
      predicted poor outcome. These results show that regulating-bone molecules, 
      especially OPG, are strong predictors of mortality in HD patients, suggesting that 
      OPG is a vascular risk factor, in particular in patients who have high C-reactive 
      protein levels. OPG determination therefore should be added to the biologic 
      follow-up of these patients.

TI  - Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations are less variable than those of 
      parathyroid hormone in stable hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 100-5
LID - 10.1038/ki.2012.77 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of bone mineral metabolism and vascular calcification are prevalent in 
      patients with kidney failure. Clinical management is based on biochemical targets, 
      in particular parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, but this has many 
      limitations including high biological variation. A possible alternative is 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP); therefore, we evaluated the biological 
      variation of this marker in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Bone ALP was measured 
      in non-fasting serum samples taken twice a week over a 6-week period in 22 stable 
      hemodialysis patients and 12 healthy volunteers. The within-individual coefficients 
      of variance were calculated and used to derive the critical difference required to 
      be certain that an observed change was significant. The coefficient of variance for 
      bone ALP was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients compared to healthy 
      individuals. Seven samples were required to estimate the homeostatic set point of 
      bone ALP, within 10%, in a hemodialysis patient. The concentration of serial bone 
      ALP measurements would need to change by 36% between any two measurements before it 
      can be considered a significant change. Since the biological variation of bone ALP 
      is less than half that reported for PTH, our study provides further support for the 
      use of bone ALP as an alternative marker of bone mineral metabolism in the setting 
      of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder.

TI  - Fetuin-mineral complex reflects extraosseous calcification stress in CKD.
PG  - 1998-2007
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2009090944 [doi]
AB  - Fetuin-A is an important inhibitor of extraosseous calcification, but some of the 
      studies that used ELISAs did not identify a significant relationship between serum 
      fetuin-A levels and vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). Here, we used centrifugation to separate a fetuin-mineral complex (FMC) 
      composed of fetuin-A, fibrinogen, fibronectin-1, and calcium from the serum of 
      hemodialysis patients. In addition, we analyzed serum fetuin-A levels of 73 patients 
      with diabetes and CKD (predialysis) after centrifugation. Fetuin-A concentrations 
      were significantly lower in supernatants than in serum from patients at any stage of 
      CKD, indicating systemic circulation of FMC in these patients. With greater severity 
      of CKD, the contribution of FMC to total fetuin-A increased. Despite the absence of 
      a correlation between serum fetuin-A and coronary artery calcification scores 
      (CACS), supernatant fetuin-A negatively correlated with CACS and the extent to which 
      centrifugation reduced fetuin-A (reduction ratio [RR]) positively correlated with 
      CACS. In a longitudinal study of 12 hemodialysis patients with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy and cinacalcet therapy each significantly 
      reduced the RR without changing supernatant fetuin-A levels after 1 month, 
      suggesting a reduction in FMC. Moreover, the magnitude of cinacalcet-induced 
      reduction in parathyroid hormone correlated with the decrease in RR but not with 
      changes in serum or supernatant fetuin-A. These data suggest that a quantitative 
      measure of FMC, not supernatant or serum fetuin-A as measured in previous studies, 
      reflects extraosseous calcification stress.

TI  - The influence of dialysate calcium on progression of arterial stiffness in 
      peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - S15-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the origins of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is 
      arterial stiffness. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between the 
      calcium content of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and arterial stiffness. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled into the study 49 PD patients who had been treated 
      with the same PD solution for the preceding 6 months. The calcium content of the PD 
      solution was 1.25 mmol/L in 34 patients (low-Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L in 15 
      patients (high-Ca group). Study patients were followed for 6 months on the same PD 
      prescription. Arterial stiffness was assessed by measurement of augmentation index 
      (AI) and brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV) at baseline and at month 6 (SphygmoCor: 
      Atcor Medical, West Ryde, NSW, Australia). Demographic data were recorded from 
      patient charts. RESULTS: Mean age of the whole group was 51 +/- 11 years, prevalence 
      of diabetes was 14%, duration of PD was 43 +/- 30 months, percentage of women was 
      45%, and percentage of patients using a cycler was 33%. We observed no differences 
      between groups with regard to those variables or creatinine clearance, residual 
      renal function, Ca, phosphorus, parathormone, C-reactive protein, lipid parameters, 
      and use of phosphate binder with or without Ca content. Mean arterial pressure was 
      higher in the high-Ca group, but the difference was not statistically significant 
      (100 +/- 22 mmHg vs 88 +/- 18 mmHg, p = 0.06). At baseline, AI was significantly 
      higher in the high-Ca group than in the low-Ca group (27% +/- 10% vs 21% +/- 9%, p < 
      0.05). Measurements of PWV were not different between the groups (8.4 +/- 1.1 m/s vs 
      8.5 +/- 1.7 m/s). Measurement of arterial stiffness parameters at month 6 revealed 
      that PWV had increased in the high-Ca group (to 9.6 +/- 2.3 m/s from 8.4 +/- 1.1 
      m/s, p < 0.05), but had not changed in the low-Ca group (to 8.2 +/- 1.9 m/s from 8.5 
      +/- 1.7 m/s). The AI did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest 
      that Ca exposure through PD solution plays a role in the progression of arterial 
      stiffness, which may be related to increased vascular calcification.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification, common carotid artery intima-media thickness and 
      aortic pulse wave velocity in patients on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 736-44
AB  - An increasing body of evidence suggests that atherosclerosis in patients with uremia 
      differs from that found in general population in terms of advancement and 
      localization of vascular lesions. It has also been suggested that different 
      non-invasive techniques of vascular system evaluation are designed to show different 
      types of lesions (i.e. vascular calcification, stiffness or 'classical' 
      atherosclerosis). The aim of the study was to search for possible associations 
      between results obtained with three different non-invasive methods of vascular 
      system assessment in three different vascular sites in patients treated with 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD). 61 patients (28 F, 33 M), mean age of 50.4+/-13.6 years, 
      on maintenance PD for a median period of 10 months (range 1-96 months) were 
      included. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 21 subjects. In all subjects 
      coronary artery calcification score (CaSc) using multi-row spiral computed 
      tomography (MSCT), aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV) and ultrasound-based common 
      carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) were performed as methods for 
      assessing coronary calcium burden, arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, 
      respectively. Median value of CaSc equaled 11.5 Agatston units (range 0-5502.8 
      units). Median AoPWV was 10.4 m/s (range 7.56-18.1 m/s), and median CCA-IMT-0.6 mm 
      (range 0.3-1.0 mm). In 16 patients (26.2%) at least one plaque in at least one 
      common carotid artery was found on ultrasound. CaSc correlated with AoPWV (R=0.32, 
      p<0.01) and with CCA-IMT (R=0.35, p<0.005), whereas no association was found between 
      AoPWV and CCA-IMT. AoPWV, but not CaSc nor IMT correlated with blood pressure. The 
      values of CCA-IMT and AoPWV increased together with consecutive Agatston categories 
      (with p<0.001 for differences in AoPWV and p<0.05 for CCA-IMT). Patients with at 
      least one plaque found in at least one CCA and patients with CAD were characterized 
      with significantly higher values of CaSc, IMT and PWV, when compared to plaque-free 
      and CAD- negative subjects, respectively. Association between CaSc and both IMT and 
      PWV may suggest that the mechanism of three assessed vascular pathologies may be 
      based, to some extent, on the process of pathologic calcium-phosphate deposition. 
      Lack of correlation found between PWV and IMT may suggest that aortic stiffness and 
      carotid atherosclerosis may partially differ in their pathologic background and/or 
      are dissociated in time.

TI  - Correlation of simple imaging tests and coronary artery calcium measured by computed 
      tomography in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1623-8
AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with an adverse prognosis in end-stage renal 
      disease. It can be accurately quantitated with computed tomography but simple 
      in-office techniques may provide equally useful information. Accordingly we compared 
      the results obtained with simple non-invasive techniques with those obtained using 
      electron beam tomography (EBT) for coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) in 140 
      prevalent hemodialysis patients. All patients underwent EBT imaging, a lateral X-ray 
      of the lumbar abdominal aorta, an echocardiogram, and measurement of pulse pressure 
      (PP). Calcification of the abdominal aorta was semiquantitatively estimated with a 
      score (Xr-score) of 0-24 divided into tertiles, echocardiograms were graded as 0-2 
      for absence or presence of calcification of the mitral and aortic valve and PP was 
      divided in quartiles. The CACS was elevated (mean 910+/-1657, median 220). The 
      sensitivity and specificity for CACS > or = 100 was 53 and 70%, for calcification of 
      either valve and 67 and 91%, respectively, for Xr-score > or = 7. The area under the 
      curve for CACS > or = 100 associated with valve calcification and Xr-score was 0.62 
      and 0.78, respectively. The likelihood ratio (95% confidence interval) of CACS > or 
      = 100 was 1.79 (1.09, 2.96) for calcification of either valve and 7.50 (2.89, 19.5) 
      for participants with an Xr-score > or = 7. In contrast, no association was present 
      between PP and CACS. In conclusion, simple measures of cardiovascular calcification 
      showed a very good correlation with more sophisticated measurements obtained with 
      EBT. These methodologies may prove very useful for in-office imaging to guide 
      further therapeutic choices in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Phosphate binders are useful for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. This study was performed to examine the effects of switching from 
      calcium carbonate (CC) to lanthanum carbonate (LC) on bone mineral metabolism and 
      inflammatory markers in HD patients. We conducted 29 stable HD patients receiving 
      CC, which was replaced by LC and followed-up for 12 weeks. Patients underwent 
      determinants of blood chemistries such as serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus, 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D status, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA levels 
      in whole blood cells were evaluated by real-time PCR just before and after the 
      treatment with LC. Corrected Ca [corrected] levels were significantly reduced, but 
      serum phosphorus levels (P levels) were unchanged after LC treatment. Switching to 
      LC increased whole-PTH, osteocalcin, 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) levels and 1,25(OH)(2) 
      D(3)/25(OH)D(3) ratio. 1,25(OH)(2) D(3)/25(OH)D(3) ratio was negatively correlated 
      with HD duration. Furthermore, whole blood cell IL-6 mRNA levels were significantly 
      reduced by LC treatment. We provided that the switching from CC to LC improved Ca 
      overload and ameliorated vitamin D and inflammatory status in HD patients. These 
      observations suggest that LC may play a protective role for the progression of 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in these patients.

TI  - Prevalence and prognostic significance of renal artery calcification in patients 
      with diabetes and proteinuria.
PG  - 2093-100
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03730410 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is common and severe in chronic 
      kidney disease. Because the consequences of calcification may differ by vascular 
      beds, we sought to test the hypothesis that patients who have diabetes with 
      proteinuria and have significant renal artery calcification (RAC) have a higher risk 
      for progression to ESRD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using 
      electron-beam computed tomography, RAC was computed as the sum of Agatston scores at 
      each of the two renal ostia and renal arteries. Time-to-event analysis was conducted 
      to compare the risk in individuals with or without significant RAC (total score 
      >10). RESULTS: Of 172 patients with type 2 diabetes and overt proteinuria studied 
      (estimated GFR 56 ± 25 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), significant RAC was present in 31%. In 
      33 ± 21 months, 41 progressed to ESRD and 65 reached a composite outcome (ESRD or 
      death). Serum phosphorus was a significant predictor of progression to ESRD but was 
      replaced by the significant RAC in multivariate models that included the latter. 
      Individuals with significant RAC had a higher risk for reaching the composite 
      outcome. In contrast, there was no association between coronary artery calcification 
      scores and progression to ESRD. CONCLUSIONS: Significant RAC was an independent 
      predictor of progression to ESRD as well as reaching the composite outcome. 
      Understanding the pathogenesis of RAC would allow determination of whether this risk 
      is potentially modifiable.

TI  - Intradialytic exercise training reduces oxidative stress and epicardial fat: a pilot 
      study.
PG  - 2695-701
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates are greatly elevated in 
      chronic kidney disease patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis therapy. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intradialytic endurance 
      exercise training on novel risk factors that may contribute to this excessive CVD 
      risk. METHODS: Seventeen haemodialysis patients were randomized to either an 
      intradialytic exercise training (cycling) group (EX; n = 8) or a non-exercising 
      control group (CON; n = 9) for 4 months. At baseline and following the intervention, 
      we measured serum parameters related to CVD risk and renal function, used 
      echocardiography to measure variables related to cardiac structure and function and 
      assessed physical performance by a validated shuttle walk test. RESULTS: Performance 
      on the shuttle walk test increased by 17% in EX (P < 0.05), but did not change in 
      CON. There was no change in serum lipids or inflammatory markers (C-reactive 
      protein, interleukin-6) in either group. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive 
      substances, a marker of oxidative stress, were reduced by 38% in EX (P < 0.05), but 
      did not change in CON. In addition, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a putative 
      risk factor for vascular calcification, was reduced by 27% in EX (P < 0.05), but did 
      not change in CON. There was no change in left atrial volume, left ventricular mass 
      or myocardial performance index in either group. However, the thickness of the 
      epicardial fat layer was reduced by 11% in EX (P < 0.05), but did not change in CON. 
      Furthermore, the change in physical performance was inversely correlated to the 
      change in epicardial fat (r = -0.63; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that endurance exercise training may improve CVD risk in haemodialysis patients by 
      decreasing novel risk factors including serum oxidative stress, ALP and epicardial 
      fat.

TI  - Calciphylaxis is associated with hyperphosphatemia and increased osteopontin 
      expression by vascular smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 1267-76
AB  - Calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a fatal disease in dialysis 
      patients due to calcification of cutaneous blood vessels. The pathogenesis has been 
      attributed to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, recent studies evaluating 
      vascular calcification in nondialysis patients have found that the smooth muscle 
      cells play an active role, including production of the bone matrix protein 
      osteopontin. To examine the involvement of various clinical parameters and smooth 
      muscle cells of CUA, we performed a case-control analysis comparing 10 CUA patients 
      with our current dialysis patients. Available histologic sections were immunostained 
      for osteopontin, markers of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. 
      Compared with our current dialysis population, patients with CUA were more likely to 
      be obese, white, and female (P < 0.02). Comparison of laboratory values found CUA 
      patients with lower serum albumin, greater serum phosphorus, and greater calcium X 
      phosphorus product (P < 0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in the 
      concentration of PTH or calcium between the 2 groups. Immunostaining of calcified 
      blood vessels showed that all calcified vessels stained positive for osteopontin, 
      whereas all the noncalcifed vessels showed no osteopontin localization. Staining for 
      smooth muscle alpha-actin decreased in the medial layer with calcification, with 
      cells appearing to be sloughed off, leading to near occlusion of the vessel lumen. 
      Our case-control study demonstrates that hyperphosphatemia and an elevated calcium X 
      phosphorus product is associated with CUA. Histologic examination suggests that the 
      calcification is associated with increased expression of osteopontin by smooth 
      muscle cells.

      while a negative balance increases iPTH. We explored the impact of different 
      dialysate calcium concentrations on bone and mineral metabolism parameters according 
      to pre-dialysis serum calcium levels. RESULTS: Fifty-six hemodialysis patients were 
      dialyzed with 3.0 or 2.5 mEq/l dialysate [calcium] in a crossover study of two 
      weeks. Bone mineral metabolites were measured prior to and following the 
      hemodialysis session. A 3.0 mEq/l dialysate [calcium] increased more post-dialysis 
      total calcium and ionized calcium than 2.5 mEq/l dialysate [calcium]. The mildest 
      dialysis-induced changes in calcium and PTH were observed in patients with 
      pre-dialysis serum calcium <8.75 mg/dl dialyzed with 2.5 mEq/l dialysate [calcium] 
      and in patients with pre-dialysis serum calcium >9.15 mg/dl dialyzed with 3.0 mEq/l 
      calcium dialysate. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the individualization of dialysate 
      calcium concentration according to baseline pre-dialysis serum calcium may prevent 
      major excursions in post-dialysis serum calcium and iPTH levels. SHORT SUMMARY: High 
      calcium dialysate may increase serum calcium in hemodialysis patients, while low 
      dialysate calcium may increase PTH. Individualization of dialysate calcium according 
      to predialysis serum calcium levels may prevent or decrease unwanted excursions of 
      both serum calcium and PTH.

TI  - Vitamin K intake and status are low in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 605-10
LID - 10.1038/ki.2012.191 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K is essential for the activity of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins 
      including matrix Gla28 protein and osteocalcin; an inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification and a bone matrix protein, respectively. Insufficient vitamin K intake 
      leads to the production of non-carboxylated, inactive proteins and this could 
      contribute to the high risk of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. To 
      help resolve this, we measured vitamin K(1) and K(2) intake (4-day food record), and 
      the vitamin K status in 40 hemodialysis patients. The intake was low in these 
      patients (median 140 μg/day), especially on days of dialysis and the weekend as 
      compared to intakes reported in a reference population of healthy adults (mean K(1) 
      and K(2) intake 200 μg/day and 31 μg/day, respectively). Non-carboxylated bone and 
      coagulation proteins were found to be elevated in 33 hemodialysis patients, 
      indicating subclinical hepatic vitamin K deficiency. Additionally, very high 
      non-carboxylated matrix Gla28 protein levels, endemic to all patients, suggest 
      vascular vitamin K deficiency. Thus, compared to healthy individuals, hemodialysis 
      patients have a poor overall vitamin K status due to low intake. A randomized 
      controlled trial is needed to test whether vitamin K supplementation reduces the 
      risk of arterial calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Intermittent doses of statin in hemodialysis patients with spontaneous low LDL 
      cholesterol levels.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality in dialysis patients remains high and is due mainly to 
      cardiovascular causes. Inflammation has a role in the genesis of accelerated 
      atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, malnutrition and anemia, and a huge impact 
      on the survival of these patients. The pleiotropic effects of statins can be a 
      therapeutic option for reducing chronic inflammatory processes of patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of low doses of 
      simvastatin on inflammatory markers, hematimetric and nutritional parameters of 
      patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: Clinically-stable patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis were classified according to their baseline LDL-cholesterol levels in 
      two groups: those with levels below 100mg/dl (Group 1) and those with levels equal 
      to or greater than 100mg/dl (Group-2), and were treated with simvastatin during 
      eight weeks. Group 1 received 20mg only after each session of hemodialysis 
      (intermittent dose), whereas Group 2 received 20mg/daily. Laboratory data, 
      erythropoietin resistance index and nutritional parameters were obtained before and 
      after treatment. RESULTS: A significant and equivalent reduction in C-reactive 
      protein levels in both groups was observed (35.97+/-49.23% vs 38.32+/-32.69%, 
      p=0.86). In group 1, there was also a tendency towards reduced resistance to 
      erythropoietin (228.6+/-16.2 vs 208.9+/-16.2, p=0.058) and improvement of 
      hematimetric parameters (hematocrit: 33.1+/-5.9% vs 36.1+/-4.5%, p=0.021). 
      CONCLUSION: Intermittent doses proved to be as effective as the usual dose in 
      reducing C-reactive protein levels and resistance to erythropoietin, besides 
      improving the hematimetric parameters, indicating an important reduction of the 
      cardiovascular risk evaluated by these parameters.

PG  - 52-9
AB  - Abstract. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that cardiovascular 
      disease is associated with an increase in mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Vascular complications are mainly secondary to calcification and 
      atherosclerosis. Interest in the association between uric acid levels and 
      cardiovascular risk has been renewed in recent years. The objective of this research 
      was to determine the relation between vascular calcification (VC) and 
      atherosclerosis, through carotid ultrasound, with uric acid levels in patients with 
      CKD in dialysis. VCs were observed in 56% of patients, 46% had ultrasound criteria 
      for atherosclerosis with an overall average of 0.89 mm (SD +/- 0.28), being higher 
      in patients with hypertension and diabetes; this group also showed increased 
      susceptibility to VC (p = 0.01). The levels of urea (141.3 mg/dL) (p = 0.01) and 
      uric acid (6.9 mg/dL) (p = 0.04) showed significant association with the presence of 
      VC. Adverse cardiovascular events were observed mainly in patients with 
      atherosclerosis and VC (p = 0.01). This investigation showed that an increase in 
      uric acid levels above 6 mg/dL is associated with an increased risk of calcification 
      and cardiovascular adverse events in CKD patients in dialysis.

TI  - Intracranial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients but 
      does not associate with acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 256-63
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2011.00543.x [doi]
AB  - Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is associated with ischemic stroke in the 
      general population but this relationship has not been examined in hemodialysis 
      patients. We examined the factors associated with IAC and its relationship with 
      acute ischemic stroke in this population. We retrospectively studied 490 head 
      computed tomographic scans from 2225 hemodialysis patients presenting with 
      neurological symptoms at our center (October 2005-May 2009). Intracranial arterial 
      calcification was graded using a validated scoring system. Multivariate regression 
      was used to examine the factors associated with the presence of IAC, its severity, 
      and its ability to predict acute ischemic stroke. Weibull's survival models analyzed 
      the relationship between IAC severity and survival. Ninety-five percent of patients 
      with ischemic stroke had IAC vs. 83% in the nonstroke group (P=0.02). Intracranial 
      arterial calcification severity increased with age (P<0.001), hemodialysis vintage 
      (P<0.001), serum phosphate (P<0.05), and major comorbidities. In patients with 
      multiple computed tomographic scans during the study period, increased IAC severity 
      at baseline was predictive of acute ischemic stroke (P=0.05) on logistic regression 
      analysis. High-grade and not low-grade IAC was associated with worse survival 
      (P=0.008). Intracranial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis 
      patients, especially in those with acute ischemic stroke. Its severity is 
      prognostically significant and associated with risk factors for vascular 
      calcification and may confer a greater risk of acute ischemic stroke. The mechanisms 
      underlying the high incidence of ischemic stroke in this patient group require 
      further comprehensive study.

TI  - Sodium thiosulfate pharmacokinetics in hemodialysis patients and healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1447-55
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10241110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is a major cause of morbidity and 
      mortality in dialysis patients. Human and animal studies indicate that sodium 
      thiosulfate (STS) may prevent the progression of vascular calcifications. The 
      pharmacokinetics of STS in hemodialysis patients has not been investigated yet. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: STS was given intravenously to 10 
      hemodialysis patients on- and off-hemodialysis. Additionally, STS was applied to 9 
      healthy volunteers once intravenously and once orally. Thiosulfate concentrations 
      were measured by using a specific and sensitive HPLC method. RESULTS: In volunteers 
      and patients, mean endogenous thiosulfate baseline concentrations were 5.5 ± 1.82 
      versus 7.1 ± 2.7 μmol/L. Renal clearance was high in volunteers (1.86 ± 0.45 ml/min 
      per kg) and reflected GFR. Nonrenal clearance was slightly, but not significantly, 
      higher in volunteers (2.25 ± 0.32 ml/min per kg) than in anuric patients (2.04 ± 
      0.72 ml/min per kg). Hemodialysis clearance of STS was 2.62 ± 1.01 ml/min per kg. On 
      the basis of the nonrenal clearance and the thiosulfate steady-state serum 
      concentrations, a mean endogenous thiosulfate generation rate of 14.6 nmol/min per 
      kg was calculated in patients. After oral application, only 4% of STS was recovered 
      in urine of volunteers, reflecting a low bioavailability of 7.6% (0.8% to 26%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the low and variable bioavailability of oral STS, only 
      intravenous STS should be prescribed today. The biologic relevance of the high 
      hemodialysis clearance for the optimal time point of STS dosing awaits clarification 
      of the mechanisms of action of STS.

TI  - Temporal Artery Calciphylaxis Presenting as Temporal Arteritis in a Case of 
      Rhinoorbitocerebral Mucormycosis.
PG  - e132-5

AB  - Mucormycosis is a rare often fatal opportunistic fungal infection. It is typically 
      described in patients with diabetes in ketoacidotic status and is rare in renal 
      transplant recipients. Calciphylaxis is a rare and highly morbid disease of vascular 
      calcification affecting patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The first case 
      of a renal transplant recipient who was inflicted with both rhinoorbitocerebral 
      mucormycosis and calciphylaxis is reported. A 45-year-old man presented with 2-day 
      history of left upper blepharoptosis, periorbital pain, left-sided headache, 
      binocular diplopia, and left V2 numbness. He had undergone renal transplant for ESRD 
      7 months earlier with resultant immunosuppressive therapy. MRI and nasal biopsy 
      confirmed rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was stopped 
      and antifungal therapy begun. He had orbital exenteration for progressive 
      rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis. Two months later, the patient reported new-onset 
      intermittent bitemporal headache and bilateral swollen, tender temporal arteries. 
      Temporal artery biopsy revealed features consistent with calciphylaxis. Clinical 
      presentation, treatment course, and follow up are discussed.

TI  - 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3, arterial calcifications and cardiovascular risk markers in 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 611-8
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased vitamin D serum levels have been recently related to arterial 
      stiffening and vascular calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients, but the 
      pathophysiology of this association is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the relationship between vascular calcifications, cardiovascular risk 
      factors [including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), pulse pressure (PP) and left 
      ventricular mass index] and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and 
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)(2)D3] serum levels. METHODS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional study with 223 prevalent HD patients, 48% females, 27% diabetics, 
      with the mean age of 62.7 +/- 15.3 years and the mean HD time of 42.9 +/- 39.3 
      months. Forty-seven percent of the patients were taking active forms of vitamin D. 
      RESULTS: Serum levels of [25(OH)D3] were low (21.6 +/- 12.2 ng/mL) and negatively 
      correlated with age (r = -0.31, P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (DM) (r = -0.20, P = 
      0.004), C-reactive protein (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), log(10) BNP (r = -0.22, P = 
      0.002), PP > 65 mmHg (r = -0.21, P = 0.003) and vascular calcifications (r = -0.26, 
      P < 0.001). Levels of [25(OH)D3] were positively correlated with [1,25(OH)(2)D3] (r 
      = 0.25, P < 0.001) and albumin (r = 0.23, P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, 
      levels of [25(OH)D3] were independently associated with DM (P < 0.001), lower 
      albumin levels (P = 0.003), higher BNP values (P = 0.005), PP > 65 mmHg (P = 0.006) 
      and a higher vascular calcification score (>or= 3) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that lower levels of [25(OH)D3] are a cardiovascular risk marker in 
      HD patients, since they are strongly associated with higher BNP levels, increased PP 
      and with the presence of vascular calcifications. The exact role of [25(OH)D3] 
      deficiency on cardiovascular morbi-mortality needs to be clarified in large 
      randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Suboptimal vitamin K status and its risk factors in a population of Chinese chronic 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 625-31
LID - 10.1111/nep.12494 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Vitamin K deficiency is known to be common in haemodialysis patients and 
      associates with adverse outcomes in this population, particularly vascular 
      calcification. We aimed to investigate the vitamin K status in a population of 
      Chinese haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We collected demographic and 
      biochemical data from a population of maintenance HD (MHD) patients in our unit and 
      a control group composed of healthy subjects from our outpatient clinic. Fasting 
      serum samples from all subjects were collected for the measurement of known vitamin 
      K-dependent proteins i.e. matrix Gla protein (MGP), osteocalcin (OC) and 
      uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC). We also quantified the fraction of ucOC to total 
      OC (%ucOC). Differences of these parameters between groups were analyzed and risk 
      factors of vitamin K deficiency based on the definition as per %ucOC were 
      investigated. RESULTS: We enrolled 93 MHD patients as a test group and 93 healthy 
      subjects as a control group. There was no significant difference in MGP between 
      groups (4.0 ± 2.8 pg/mL in MHD vs 4.2 ± 1.2 pg/mL in control; P = 0.676). Mean %ucOC 
      was significantly greater in the MHD patients as compared to control subjects 
      (76.4 ± 20.0% in MHD vs 48.56 ± 15.5%; P < 0.001). Time on dialysis and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol level appeared to be indicators of vitamin K deficiency, 
      with the former being an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Defining Vitamin K 
      deficiency by %ucOC, suboptimal vitamin K levels appear common in Chinese MHD 
      patients. Time on dialysis and LDL cholesterol level predict vitamin K deficiency.

TI  - Attenuation of aortic calcification with lanthanum carbonate versus calcium-based 
      phosphate binders in haemodialysis: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1797.2010.01412.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. Few controlled studies have addressed interventions to 
      reduce VC but non-calcium-based phosphate binders may be beneficial. No published 
      randomized study to date has assessed the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on VC 
      progression. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine 
      the effect of LC on VC. Forty-five HD patients were randomized to either LC or 
      calcium carbonate (CC). Primary outcome was change in aortic VC after 18 months. 
      Secondary outcomes included superficial femoral artery (SFA) VC, bone mineral 
      density (BMD) of lumbar spine and serum markers of mineral metabolism. At baseline, 
      6 and 18 month computed tomography was performed to measure VC and BMD. A random 
      effect linear regression model was performed to assess differences. RESULTS: Thirty 
      patients completed the study (17 LC, 13 CC); baseline median age 58 years, 38% 
      diabetic, 64% male. Ninety-three per cent had aortic VC at commencement and 87% 
      showed progression. At 18 months, there was significantly less aortic VC progression 
      with LC than CC (adjusted difference -98.1 (-149.4, -46.8) Hounsfield units (HU), P 
      < 0.001). There was also a non-significant reduction with LC in left SFA VC (-25.8 
      (-67.7, 16.1) HU, P = 0.2) and right SFA VC (-35.9 (-77.8, 5.9) HU, P = 0.09). There 
      was no difference in lumbar spine BMD and serum phosphate, calcium and parathyroid 
      hormone levels between groups. Limitations to the study include small sample size 
      and loss to follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Lanthanum carbonate was associated with reduced 
      progression of aortic calcification compared with CC in HD patients over 18 months.
