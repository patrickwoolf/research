(English) By: Craver L; Dusso A; Martinez-Alonso M; Sarro F; Valdivielso JM; Fernández E, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2013 Oct 12; Vol. 14, pp. 221; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 24119158; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were studied in 178 patients.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with severe AAC (KI &gt; 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 &lt; 1/3.9.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 &lt; 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24119158&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24119158&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24119158&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;A low fractional excretion of Phosphate/Fgf23 ratio is associated with severe abdominal Aortic calcification in stage 3 and 4 kidney disease patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: de Bie MK; Buiten MS; Rotmans JI; Hogenbirk M; Schalij MJ; Rabelink TJ; Jukema JW, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2017 Mar 02; Vol. 18 (1), pp. 82; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 28253835; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 ± 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 ± 4.9 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 (p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p &lt; 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.<br /><strong>Trial Registration: </strong>NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ; ISRCTN20479861 , registered 2-5-2007.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28253835&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28253835&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28253835&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

The mechanism is unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study.<br /><strong>Methodology and Principal Findings: </strong>A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P&lt;0.001).<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that underlies these relationships is warranted.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22723973&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22723973&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22723973&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Aortic calcification and femoral bone density are independently associated with left ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Kirkpantur A; Altun B; Hazirolan T; Akata D; Arici M; Kirazli S; Turgan C, Artificial organs [Artif Organs], ISSN: 1525-1594, 2009 Oct; Vol. 33 (10), pp. 844-54; Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell; PMID: 19681840; <br />Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P &lt; 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design of the study.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19681840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19681840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19681840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Association among serum fetuin-A level, coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral densitometry in maintenance hemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Mary A; Hartemann A; Liabeuf S; Aubert CE; Kemel S; Salem JE; Cluzel P; Lenglet A; Massy ZA; Lalau JD; Mentaverri R; Bourron O; Kamel S, Cardiovascular diabetology [Cardiovasc Diabetol], ISSN: 1475-2840, 2017 Feb 15; Vol. 16 (1), pp. 24; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 28202017; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been characterized. The present study investigated the association between metformin use and lower-limb arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully collected from the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. Biochemical and clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification score than metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 4684 ± 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use and calcification score (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use, renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA 1c levels, and inflammation.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently associated with a lower below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This association may contribute to metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these results.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28202017&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28202017&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28202017&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial calcification score in type 2 diabetic patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

The effects of cardiac biomarkers and AAC on maximal exercise capacity in CKD are unknown and were studied.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>One hundred seventy-four CKD 4-5 patients not on maintenance dialysis underwent maximal bicycle ergometry stress testing, lateral lumbar radiograph to study AAC, echocardiography and biochemical assessments.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The subjects with proportional maximal ergometry workload (WMAX%) less than 50% of the expected values had higher TnT, proBNP, AAC, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular mass index, E/e' and pulse pressure, and lower global longitudinal strain compared to the better performing patients. TnT (β = - 0.09, p = 0.02), AAC (β = - 1.67, p &lt; 0.0001) and diabetes (β = - 11.7, p &lt; 0.0001) remained significantly associated with WMAX% in the multivariable model. Maximal ergometry workload (in Watts) was similarly associated with TnT and AAC in addition to age, male gender, hemoglobin and diastolic blood pressure in a respective multivariate model. AAC and TnT showed fair predictive power for WMAX% less than 50% of the expected value with AUCs of 0.70 and 0.75, respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>TnT and AAC are independently associated with maximal ergometry stress test workload in patients with advanced CKD.<br /><strong>Trial Registration: </strong>http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04223726.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33541279&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33541279&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=33541279&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Association of maximal stress ergometry performance with troponin T and abdominal aortic calcification score in advanced chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

The association of vascular changes with regulators of extraosseous calcification in this patient population is still under investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor osteoprotegerin (OPG) with vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In this cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic hemodialysis patients, we measured carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) with applanation tonometry, reflecting arterial stiffness, and common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as serum levels of fetuin-A and OPG.

In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a prospective study to investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis patients and examined its prognostic value in long-term outcome.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>A total of 712 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. AAC was identified on postero-anterior chest X-ray films and classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The patients were followed for 10 years.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) as Gr. 1, in 116 patients (16.3%) as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older patients who had lower albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10 years, we found that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p &lt; 0.05) and all-cause mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3: 53.2%; p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The severity of AAC also influenced their survival.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Calcification of the aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography was an important determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted long-term survival.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24847332&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24847332&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24847332&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Calcification of the aortic arch predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Surgical evaluation was performed in the workup of all patients with chronic renal insufficiency prior to listing on the Eurotransplant Kidney Waiting List. It included medical history, a clinical examination, and a native CT scan of the pelvic region to ascertain vascular calcification of the iliac vessels. Radiologic detection of vascular calcification was obtained by native CT scan of the pelvic region. Radiologic examination was performed at the time of clinical examination or not more than 3 months earlier. The different vascular segments in the iliac region that are possible sites for graft anastomosis were reported separately: right and left external iliac artery (REIA and LEIA), common iliac artery (RCIA and LCIA), and distal aorta (AO). The grade of vascular calcification was standardized (in intervals of 0.5 from grade 0=without any radiologically visible calcification, grade 1=calcific deposits in up to one‐third of the arterial circumference, grade 2=calcification of up to two‐thirds of the circumference, to grade 3=maximum/circular calcification). Recommendation on site preference for surgical anastomosis was given based on radiologic and clinical investigations. In severe cases of circumferential calcification, it was documented that anastomosis was not possible without preceding vascular surgical intervention. All patients with chronic renal insufficiency who had been evaluated for renal transplantation between 2008 and 2012 were included in the study. Preoperative surgical evaluations were analyzed retrospectively. Risk factors for vascular calcification such as age, sex, diabetes, smoking, BMI, diagnosis, and duration of dialysis were evaluated in the study population. Total iliac vascular calcification without aortic segment was defined as being clinically most representative for the risk analysis in subgroups. Influence of iliac vascular calcification on outcome was investigated. Charlson comorbidity index at the time of surgical evaluation was determined, and the influence on outcome was also analyzed. Survival status, renal transplantation/need for surgical revision after renal transplantation, and reasons for graft loss were investigated with a focus on graft loss attributed to iliac vascular calcification. Median postoperative follow‐up was 51 months (37‐66 months). Early graft loss was defined as an intra‐operative graft loss or graft loss within 48 hours after transplantation.</p><a id="AN0121580782-3"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0121580782-3" title="Statistics">Statistics</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All variables were checked for plausibility and outliers.

The nonparametric Mann‐Whitney U test was used for comparisons between two independent groups, the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test for comparisons between two dependent groups, and the nonparametric Kruskal‐Wallis test for comparisons between more than two groups. Pairwise group comparisons were implemented in the Kruskal‐Wallis test considering multiple testing and correcting after Bonferroni procedure. The influence of risk factors on overall calcification (without AO) was investigated with several uni‐ and multivariate linear regression models. Relationships between dialysis duration and overall calcification (without AO) were tested with Spearman's correlation, and for all other correlations, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used.

The mean age of all patients was 53.9±11.7 years. Male patients were 54.6±11.6, and female patients 52.0±12.0 years old (Table [NaN] ). There was no significant difference between men and women (P&gt;.05). 50.7% of the patients were 55 years or younger, and 49.3% were older than 55 years. Thirty‐two women (15.6% of all patients) and 72 men (35.1% of all patients) were 55 years or younger. Twenty‐seven women (13.2% of all patients) and 74 men (36.1% of all patients) were older than 55 years. In 43.9% of the patients, the underlying renal disease was of vascular origin, in 31.7% of nonvascular, and in 24.4% of unknown origin; 23.5% of all patients had diabetes; three (1.5%) had type 1 diabetes, and 45 (22%) type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes were insulin‐dependent for 36.7±2.3 years compared to 14.4±11.1 years of insulin dependent and/or oral antidiabetic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Of the diabetic patients, 12 had coexisting coronary disease symptoms four (all with type 2 diabetes) had coexisting carotid symptoms, and 17 (two of these with type 1 diabetes) had peripheral vascular disease symptoms. Three of the patients with type 2 diabetes had had amputations, which had been bilateral in one of these cases, and one patient with type 1 diabetes had an amputated leg. Because of the low number of patients with type 1 diabetes, all diabetic patients were subsumed for statistical analyses. Mean BMI was 26.2±4.4 in all patients, 26.4±4.3 in men, and 25.9±4.6 in women. There was no significant difference between the sexes (P&gt;.05). Seventy‐five of all 205 patients were smokers consuming between 1 and 120 pack‐years (mean 27.7±21.0 pack‐years). COPD was present in 13 patients of which four were nonsmokers. After surgical evaluation for renal transplantation, recommendations for surgery were given in 204 patients: Transplantation on both sides was declared possible in 63.9%, in 3.4% (seven patients) renal transplantation was declined because of a calcification score between 2.5 and 3 in all regions of the iliac arteries, in 16.1% the right side was recommended, and in 10.2% the left side was recommended. In 5.9% of cases, the decision was postponed for other reasons (high BMI, interventions before transplantation). In nearly half of the patients (49.1%) with a decision on laterality, this decision was based on distinct unilateral iliac calcification according to CT‐based scoring (calcification score between 2.5 and 3) or one side showing a more favorable grade of vascular calcification.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Characteristics of patients enrolled in the study</p><p

(English) By: Bural GG; Torigian DA; Sözmen M; Houseni M; Alavi A, Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine [Hell J Nucl Med], ISSN: 1790-5427, 2018 Sep-Dec; Vol. 21 (3), pp. 169-174; Publisher: Hellenic Society of Nuclear Medicine; PMID: 30411726; <br /><strong>Objective: </strong>Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The primary underlying mechanism has been suggested as accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Our aim was to compare the atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 F-FDG PET/CT).<br /><strong>Subjects and Methods: </strong>Forthy two subjects who underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively studied. Twenty one were subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis (67±11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 were age- and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, descending, abdominal) and for the common iliac arteries and common femoral arteries were measured. Standardized uptake value maximum and SUVmean for right atrial blood pool were also measured as the background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean, average SUVmax/background ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were compared between subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of macroscopic calcification on CT images for each arterial segment based on visual qualitative assessment was also noted and compared. For statistical analysis, two-sided t-test was used for continuous variables, and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We considered a P value of &lt;0.05 as statistically significant.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Average SUVmax and SUVmean were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD than in controls in all arterial segments. Average SUVmax/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the left femoral artery. Average SUVmean/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the right and left femoral arteries. Presence of calcification on CT was more frequently encountered in all arterial segments in subjects with ESRD, and was statistically significantly greater for the aortic arch, descending aorta, and right and left femoral arteries.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>SUV measurements representing the atherosclerotic inflammatory changes and macroscopic atherosclerotic calcifications appear to be accelerated in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to normal controls. Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is a valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying accelerated atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30411726&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30411726&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30411726&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Comparison of atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis to normal controls utilizing 18 F-FDG PET/CT.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Golembiewska E; Qureshi AR; Dai L; Lindholm B; Heimbürger O; Söderberg M; Brismar TB; Ripsweden J; Barany P; Johnson RJ; Stenvinkel P, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2020 Feb 07; Vol. 21 (1), pp. 43; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 32033584; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Vascular calcification (VC) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) present in 30-70% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Copeptin is a sensitive surrogate marker of arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is involved in many pathophysiologic processes in CKD. The aim of the present study was to explore the association of copeptin with VC in CKD stage 5.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Copeptin was investigated in conjunction with living donor kidney transplantation in 149 clinically stable CKD stage 5 patients (CKD5), including 53 non-dialyzed (CKD5-ND) and 96 dialysis patients treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n = 43) or hemodialysis (HD) (n = 53). We analyzed the association of copeptin with presence and extent of VC ascertained both histologically in biopsies from the inferior epigastric artery (n = 137) and by coronary artery calcification (CAC) score measured by computed tomography.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Patients with higher copeptin were older, had higher systolic blood pressure, higher prevalence of CVD and their preceding time on chronic dialysis was longer. In Spearman's rank correlations (Rho), copeptin concentrations were significantly associated with CAC score (Rho = 0.27; p = 0.003) and presence of medial VC (Rho = 0.21; p = 0.016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 1-SD higher age, male gender, diabetes and 1-SD higher copeptin were significantly associated with the presence of moderate-extensive VC.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>High circulating levels of copeptin in CKD5 patients are independently associated with the degree of medial calcification ascertained by histology of arterial biopsies.

Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave velocity.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161).<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21940840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21940840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21940840&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Correlates of osteoprotegerin and association with aortic pulse wave velocity in patients with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Corp; PMID: 26629071; <br /><strong>Objective: </strong>The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with hemodialysis.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 ηg/ml or less than 30 ηg/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (&gt;30 ηg/ml). All of the subjects underwent lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree of calcification (Kauppila score).<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Among the 126 patients treated with MHD, there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no significant difference found in gender, age, age of dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the two groups. The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had a negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P = 0.193). Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor for vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is generally low in patients with MHD.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a higher incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative correlation. Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D deficiency should be actively treated.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26629071&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26629071&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26629071&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: de Bie MK; Buiten MS; Gaasbeek A; Boogers MJ; Roos CJ; Schuijf JD; Krol MJ; Rabelink TJ; Bax JJ; Schalij MJ; Jukema JW, PloS one [PLoS One], ISSN: 1932-6203, 2013 Jul 10; Vol. 8 (7), pp. e67936; Publisher: Public Library of Science; PMID: 23874471; <br /><strong>Purpose: </strong>Significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic dialysis patients. Identifying these high risk patients is warranted and may improve the prognosis of this vulnerable patient group. Routine catheterization of incident dialysis patients has been proposed, but is considered too invasive. CT-angiography may therefore be more appropriate. However, extensive coronary calcification, often present in this patient group, might hamper adequate lumen evaluation. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of CT-angiography in this patient group.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>For this analysis all patients currently participating in the ICD2 trial (ISRCTN20479861), with no history of PCI or CABG were included. The major epicardial vessels were evaluated on a segment basis (segment 1-3, 5-8, 11 and 13) by a team consisting of an interventional and an imaging specialist. Segments were scored as not significant, significant and not interpretable.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>A total of 70 dialysis patients, with a mean age of 66±8 yrs and predominantly male (70%) were included. The median calcium score was 623 [79, 1619]. Over 90% of the analyzed segments were considered interpretable. The incidence of significant CAD on CT was 43% and was associated with cardiovascular events during follow-up. The incidence of cardiovascular events after 2-years follow-up: 36% vs. 0% in patients with no significant CAD (p&lt;0.01).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Despite the high calcium scores CT-angiography is feasible for the evaluation of the extent of CAD in dialysis patients. Moreover the presence of significant CAD on CT was associated with events during follow-up.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23874471&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23874471&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=23874471&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;CT coronary angiography is feasible for the assessment of coronary artery disease in chronic dialysis patients, despite high average calcium scores.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

It is not clear to what extent low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with higher risk of CAC and if sex interacts. We investigated the sex-specific associations of CAC score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with BMD of different skeletal sub-regions.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In 174 ESRD patients, median age 57 (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63% males, BMD (measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac CT) and circulating inflammatory biomarkers were analysed.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>A total of 104 (60%) patients with CAC &gt; 100 AUs were older, had higher prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, higher level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower tBMD and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients. Female patients with high CAC (&gt; 100 AUs) had significantly decreased T-score of tBMD, and lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC (≤ 100 AUs); elevated CAC score were associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no such differences was observed in males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) analysis adjusted for age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher CAC score (1057 AUs) was predicted by either per SD (0.13 g/cm 2 ) lower tBMD or per SD (0.17 g/cm 2 ) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found in male ESRD patients.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>In female, but not male, lower BMD, in particular sub-regions of legs, was associated with higher CAC score independently. Low BMD has the potential to identify increased risk for high CAC score in ESRD patients.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30777028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30777028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=30777028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Differences in association of lower bone mineral density with higher coronary calcification in female and male end-stage renal disease patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

However, as SHARP was analysed as an ‘intention to treat’ analysis, it should be acknowledged that a substantial proportion of patients who started the trial as CKD stage 3–5 progressed and became incident dialysis patients during the course of the study. The lack of beneficial effects of statins in dialysis patients suggests either that LDL lowering does not confer a benefit in this specific patient population or alternatively that statins have pleiotropic effects that counteract the beneficial effects of LDL lowering.

The majority (n = 70) of the 89 statin‐treated patients received simvastatin; the remaining patients were on atorvastatin (n = 16), fluvastatin (n = 2) and pravastatin (n = 1). The CAC scores in statin and nonstatin users are depicted in Fig. [NaN] . As expected, 89 statin users were older (61 vs. 51 years; P &lt; 0·001) and had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (34% vs. 15%; P = 0·002) and CVD (33% vs. 15%; P = 0·002) than 151 patients with ESRD not on statins (Table [NaN] ). Significantly higher median iPTH (314 vs. 252 ng/L; P &lt; 0·05) and HbA1c levels (44 vs. 38 mmol/mol; P &lt; 0·05) in statin users likely reflect the higher prevalence of diabetes. As expected, statin users had lower median cholesterol (4·2 vs. 4·8 mM; P &lt; 0·001) and ApoB (0·80 vs. 0·91 g/L; P &lt; 0·001) levels as a result of ongoing treatment. Whereas CRP levels did not differ significantly between statin and nonstatin users, median levels of TNF (16·0 vs. 13·7 pg/mL; P = 0·007) and IL‐6 (4·9 vs. 2·8 pg/mL; P &lt; 0·05) were higher in statin users. After adjustments for confounders by GLM (age, gender, BMI, diabetes, inflammation), only age, male gender, diabetes and statins remained significantly related to high CAC score (Table [NaN] ). Statins were independently associated with higher CAC score irrespective of the inflammatory biomarker (CRP, IL‐6, TNF) included in the model (Table [NaN] ). In the multivariate model, neither clinical CVD (considered a result rather than the cause of elevated CAC score), cholesterol and apoB (considered related to statin treatment), nor HbA1c nor triglyceride levels (considered related to diabetes mellitus) were included. As categorization of age may reduce the adjustment power and leave room for residual confounding, GLM was also performed with age as a continuous variable. The relation between statins and high CAC score remained significant.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics in statin and

Statin treatment was an independent predictor of a high CAC score, which suggests that statins may promote vascular calcification in predisposed individuals. As statin users were older, had higher BMI and had higher burden of diabetes and CVD (Table [NaN] ), our immediate reflex was that the observed link is a reflection of ‘confounding by indication’ [<a id="bib42up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib42" id="ref_linkbib42" title="42">42</a>] .

In the present study, the link between statins and increased CAC score remained significant after adjustment for age (also when age was included in the model as a continuous variable), diabetes, BMI and inflammation. Recent studies in nonrenal patients also suggest that statins promote vascular calcification. Puri et al. [<a id="bib27up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib27" id="ref_linkbib27" title="27">27</a>] reported that although statins reduced the atheroma volume, they promoted coronary atheroma calcification. Nakazato et al. [<a id="bib26up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib26" id="ref_linkbib26" title="26">26</a>] found that statin treatment is associated with an increased prevalence and extent of coronary plaques possessing calcium. Moreover, in a recent study of gene expression signatures, pathways and networks in patients with carotid atherosclerosis, Perisic et al. [<a id="bib44up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib44" id="ref_linkbib44" title="44">44</a>] reported a possible stabilizing calcifying mechanism by statins. Another recent report based on 3483 participants showed that statin intake was associated with a 31% higher progression of CAC even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors [<a id="bib45up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib45" id="ref_linkbib45" title="45">45</a>] . Finally, pooled data from two clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a greater progression of CAC compared to placebo [<a id="bib46up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib46" id="ref_linkbib46" title="46">46</a>] . However, the greater progression of CAC with statin therapy was not associated with greater risk of cardiovascular events, which could imply that calcified plaques are more stable and less prone to rupture. Also, in vitro cell culture studies suggest that statins stimulate calcium deposition in smooth muscle vascular cells [<a id="bib47up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib47" id="ref_linkbib47" title="47">47</a>] and mesenchymal stem cells [<a id="bib48up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib48" id="ref_linkbib48" title="48">48</a>] . The pathophysiological mechanisms by which statins promote vascular calcifications are not evident. As statins induce dose‐dependent apoptosis [<a id="bib49up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib49" id="ref_linkbib49" title="49">49</a>] , it could be speculated that apoptotic bodies serve as a nidus for calcium deposition.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Vitamin K deficiency is common in ESRD [<a id="bib50up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib50" id="ref_linkbib50" title="50">50</a>] , and vitamin K supplementation has been proposed to arrest progression of vascular calcification [<a id="bib51up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib51" id="ref_linkbib51" title="51">51</a>] . Lipophilic statins inhibit the enzymatic activity of UbiA prenyltransferase domain‐containing protein 1 (UBIAD1) and enzyme which plays a significant role in vitamin K2 synthesis [<a id="bib52up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib52" id="ref_linkbib52" title="52">52</a>] . Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that statins may accelerate artery calcification [<a id="bib38up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib38" id="ref_linkbib38" title="38">38</a>] , [<a id="bib39up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib39" id="ref_linkbib39" title="39">39</a>] via depletion of vascular vitamin K2 levels, thereby increasing uncarboxylated matrix gla protein (MGP) [<a id="bib53up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib53" id="ref_linkbib53" title="53">53</a>] , [<a id="bib54up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib54" id="ref_linkbib54" title="54">54</a>] . Indeed, our in vitro data demonstrate that synthesis of vitamin K2 is impaired in the presence of statins (Fig. [NaN] ). Whether statins also inhibit vitamin K2 syntheses in vivo and subsequent MGP carboxylation has to be demonstrated. One alternative explanation is that the treatment with statins was mainly confined to selected patients who had more extensive atherosclerotic lesions because they had been exposed for longer periods to high levels of LDL. Atherosclerosis causes intima‐media expansion due to the accumulation of extracellular matrix made of sulphated proteoglycans and collagen, which can serve as an ideal environment for calcium deposition [<a id="bib55up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib55" id="ref_linkbib55" title="55">55</a>] , [<a id="bib56up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib56" id="ref_linkbib56" title="56">56</a>] . Our observations require further studies to discriminate between true pro‐calcifying effects of statins and epiphenomena linked to – but not causally related to – statin treatment in selected patients with more extensive preexisting lesions than those patients not receiving statins. In addition, further studies should clarify the possible contribution of vitamin K2 depletion [<a id="bib57up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib57" id="ref_linkbib57" title="57">57</a>] and the potential differences in the putative pro‐calcifying effects of lipophilic vs. hydrophilic statins [<a id="bib58up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib58" id="ref_linkbib58" title="58">58</a>] . As 97% of the patients who received statins in the present study were on lipophilic statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin), it is of interest that in a rat model of CKD, the hydrophilic pravastatin (and olmesartan) synergistically ameliorated vascular calcification [<a id="bib56up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib56" id="ref_linkbib56" title="56">56</a>] .</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between systemic inflammation and CAC.

Similar to our study, Khera et al.

Variations in population sample sizes, inclusion criteria, inflammatory biomarkers studied and analysis techniques may contribute to the observed differences [<a id="bib22up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib22" id="ref_linkbib22" title="22">22</a>] . The reason(s) for the lack of independent association between inflammatory biomarkers and CAC score are not evident. As the inflammatory process is complex, differences between systemic and local vascular inflammation need consideration. It is also possible that inflammatory biomarkers and CAC reflect distinct different pathophysiology [<a id="bib16up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib16" id="ref_linkbib16" title="16">16</a>] . While inflammation plays a central role in atherosclerosis, the mechanisms of factors that predispose to arteriosclerosis may involve many other pathways, such as diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, autonomic dysfunction and disturbed mineral metabolism [<a id="bib62up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib62" id="ref_linkbib62" title="62">62</a>] .</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We report that high CAC score was an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality risk. As neither diabetes nor clinical CVD predicted death when CAC score and age were accounted for, the results suggest that in the toxic uremic milieu, the degree of coronary calcification represents the major mortality risk factor associated with diabetes and CVD. Cross‐sectional and prospective studies have confirmed that CAC is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular risk beyond that provided by conventional risk factors [<a id="bib63up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib63" id="ref_linkbib63" title="63">63</a>] .

Calcification may reflect stabilization and maturation of atherosclerotic plaques and may lead to fewer coronary heart disease deaths [<a id="bib65up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib65" id="ref_linkbib65" title="65">65</a>] . As the CAC score is defined by volume × density of calcification, it is of interest that a study in 3398 nonrenal patients showed that whereas a high CAC volume score predicted CVD risk, high CAC density was inversely associated with CVD risk [<a id="bib66up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib66" id="ref_linkbib66" title="66">66</a>] . Thus, in future studies of patients with ESRD, the impact of the volume and density scores should be evaluated separately. As part of the beneficial effects of statins has been attributed to plaque stabilization by calcification [<a id="bib27up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib27" id="ref_linkbib27" title="27">27</a>] , [<a id="bib46up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib46" id="ref_linkbib46" title="46">46</a>] , studies should evaluate whether statin‐induced calcification in uremic coronary arteries is protective or confers higher risk [<a id="bib67up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib67" id="ref_linkbib67" title="67">67</a>] .</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some strengths and limitations should be considered when the results of the present study are interpreted. Although the sample size and the number of events during follow‐up were limited, this is the first study exploring whether the mortality predictive role of a high CAC score is modified by uremic inflammation. Among the limitations, the observational nature of the study precludes conclusions regarding causality. Moreover, the use of cardiac CT for the measurement of CAC does not allow differentiation of medial from intimal calcification and does not provide information about the composition of plaques. However, we have reported on a strong association between the magnitude of medial vascular calcification in the epigastric artery and degree of CAC [<a id="bib28up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib28" id="ref_linkbib28" title="28">28</a>] . Our study comprised patients with ESRD from three different cohorts with somewhat different inclusion criteria; however, in the multivariate analysis, treatment modality was corrected for. The lack of data on duration of CKD and statin treatment prior to inclusion also limits the interpretation of the results. Finally, analyses of inactive and active MGP and vitamin K would have benefited the study.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, increased CAC score predicts mortality risk independently of inflammation in ESRD. As our results imply that the use of statins associates with progression of CAC in ESRD, further studies are warranted to confirm this finding and to clarify whether this translates into greater or less risk of cardiovascular events. Based on the current in vitro experiments, we hypothesize that statin‐induced inhibition of vitamin K synthesis might be one factor contributing to statins′ lack of effect on outcome in ESRD.</p><a id="AN0121000770-14"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0121000770-14" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We thank the patients who participated in the study.

(English) By: Tarrass F; Benjelloun M; Medkouri G; Hachim K; Benghanem MG; Ramdani B, Hemodialysis international. International Symposium on Home Hemodialysis [Hemodial Int], ISSN: 1492-7535, 2006 Oct; Vol. 10 (4), pp. 356-9; Publisher: Blackwell Pub; PMID: 17014511; <br />Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been reported in hemodialysis (HD) patients, but data regarding its incidence and mechanisms are scarce. The aims of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of unexplained PH in long-term HD patients, and to examine some possible etiologic factors for its occurrence. The prevalence of PH was estimated by Doppler echocardiography in a cohort of 86 stable patients on HD via arteriovenous access for more than 12 months. All the patients underwent full clinical evaluation, chest radiography, and a standard 12-lead echocardiograph. Laboratory investigation included a mean of 12 months (serum calcium, phosphorus, parathormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, lipids, and hemoglobin). Pulmonary hypertension was defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt;35 mmHg as determined by Doppler echocardiography using the modified Bernoulli equation. Pulmonary hypertension was detected in 23 patients (26.74%). Of those with PH, left ventricular hypertrophy was seen in 13 patients (56.52%), and valvular calcifications in 6 patients (26.08%). There were no significant differences between both groups with regard to age, sex, duration of dialysis, shunt location, and all the biological parameters of the study. The presence of PH was not related to the level of PTH, or the severity of other metabolic abnormalities. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of PH among patients with ESRD receiving long-term HD via surgical arteriovenous access. The role of the vascular access, anemia, or secondary hyperparathyroidism as the etiology of PH in HD patients did not hold in this study.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17014511&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17014511&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=17014511&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Doppler echocardiograph evaluation of pulmonary hypertension in patients undergoing hemodialysis.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Regarding their relative accuracy, we found that they vary differently with several factors. For DU method, as well as BTM, more time on dialysis (&gt;48 months) was significantly associated to a lower Qa. This fact could be explained by longer time of vessels exposure to atherosclerosis, calcification and endothelial inflammation.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In a similar way, patients with their first VA had higher values. A second access certainly reflects a previous failure (primary or not) that is probably associated with higher prevalence and longer exposure to harmful risk factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As found by other authors older patients (&gt;65 years) had significantly lower values, which may have to do with vascular aging itself apart from other factors. This age group may need special surveillance to optimize their VA patency.[18]<sup>,</sup>[19]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We also found significantly lower Qa values for more negative intra-access arterial pressure. This result may be justified by the fact that the artery is the vessel that feeds the access and both calcification and stiffness clearly compromise the access well-functioning.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In contrast to previous studies, no significant difference was noticed for Qa measured by both methods, according to gender, hypertensive status, and analytical parameters related with metabolism bone disease.[<a id="bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="1">1</a>]<sup>,</sup>[20]<sup>,</sup>[21]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regarding DU method, according to previous studies, Qa was significantly lower in distal AVFs, probably related with the smaller size of the vessels at this location (20). Similar as time on dialysis, VA time &gt;2 years was associated with lower DU-Qa, which is also probably related with more time of exposure to deleterious factors related to the uremia and dialysis, as already described above.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Regarding BTM method, according to published data, diabetic patients had inferior access flows, increasing their risk of failure.[18]<sup>,</sup>[22]<sup>,</sup>[23] This fact could be associated with a more aggressive atherosclerotic disease, which phatologic mechanisms overlap the NH.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally, higher SVCS was associated with lower flows measured by DU (Figure 2). Several factors may contribute to the intimal lesions and stenosis.[24]<sup>,</sup>[25] Alterations in blood flow and sheer stress due to the anastomosis configuration and the arterial flow through a low resistance vein are the most mentioned.[[<a id="bib4up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4" title="4">4</a>]]<sup>,</sup>[[26]] However, some data suggests that uremia and some patient comorbid conditions may contribute to NH prior to VA creation, which can compromise future patency.[31] Several conditions like catabolic status,[32]<sup>,</sup>[33] malnutrition, lower nPCR,[33]<sup>,</sup>[34] higher plasma cholesterol levels,[35] disturbances of calcium and phosphorus, hyperparathyroidism,[36]<sup>,</sup>[37] diabetes mellitus, smoking, anticardiolipin antibodies, gender, age, use of a dialysis catheter, hypoalbuminemia, as well as, high serum levels of lipoprotein A and fibronectin[<a id="bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="1">1</a>]<sup>,</sup>[21]<sup>,</sup>[38] have been identified as possible predictors of early NH and vascular disease. In a molecular point of view, it is thought that the presence of inflammation and oxidation caused by these multiple factors can predispose to further NH by means of the stimulation of growth factors that promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.[30] Parallel to this, mediators such as TNF-α induce mineralization of vascular cells, which explain how inflammation, atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are linked and together facilitate VA failure.[39]<sup>,</sup>[40] In this setting, a strong predictor of extra esqueletal calcification, especially vascular, like this score may be an additional risk factor to include in monitoring programs.</p><a id="AN0110263012-7"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0110263012-7" title="Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Access blood flow measured by Doppler ultrasound is highly correlated with the blood temperature sensor BTM® method; furthermore, this direct method is more sensitive to patient-related risk factors for VA failure. Although proper monitoring and surveillance techniques have been shown to improve the overall success of VA care, they are far from being perfect.[41] When evaluating hemodialysis VA, we should take into account all the patient's comorbidities and risk factors to decide the best approach. The SCVS may be an additional predictor of failure that could be included in future recommendations helping identify high risk patients. A modification of screening systems according to risk stratification will allow us to potentially identify subgroups at higher risk of failure to whom intensifying surveillance programs should be considered. This additional tool may improve the overall success of VA care, resulting in cost savings for the healthcare system.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study has several limitations.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. Methods: Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice multidetector computed tomography scanner. Results: There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.48). Conclusion: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Keywords: end-stage renal disease; coronary artery calcification; epicardial adipose tissue</p><a id="AN0064485974-2"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0064485974-2" title="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction (ED), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery calcification (CAC), and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are the most commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.[[<a id="bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="1">1</a>]] Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an unacceptable risk for premature death when compared with general population.[<a id="bib3up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="3">3</a>] In a review of <em>85 studies</em>, involving a total of 552,258 patients, it was found that there was a significant link between kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk.[<a id="bib4up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib4" id="ref_linkbib4" title="4">4</a>] Because of the deleterious effect of diabetes on endothelial cells,[[<a id="bib5up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="5">5</a>]] diabetic nephropathy confers an additional and additive risk for CVD in CKD patients.[[<a id="bib7up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7" title="7">7</a>]] Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true visceral fat depot of the heart that accounts for approximately 20% of total heart weight and covers 80% of the cardiac surfaces, mostly in the grooved segments along the paths of coronary arteries.[[<a id="bib9up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9" title="9">9</a>]]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Recent studies showed a close relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and EAT by using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and echocardiography in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD.[[12]] The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in patients with ESRD reflects the severity of the atherosclerotic vascular disease and predicts the cardiovascular events.[[16]] In recent studies, the authors concluded that EAT acts as an extremely active organ that produces several bioactive adipokines as well as proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, monocyte chemotactic protein, interleukin (IL)-6, and resistin.[[13], [18]] Levels of most of these cytokines are also increased in ESRD patients.[[22]] It is therefore reasonable to postulate that EAT is a source of inflammatory signals in patients with ESRD. Studies focusing on the association between CACS and EAT in ESRD patients are lacking.

Of a total of 75 patients, 4 patients had congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III–IV), 3 patients had active infection, 5 patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism, and 3 patients had autoimmune disease including systemic lupus erythematosus and microscopic polyangiitis and were excluded. None of the patients included in the study had arrhythmia based on ECG. The remaining 60 ESRD patients fulfilled the above criteria and were enrolled in the study. Twenty age-matched and sex-matched healthy individuals referred from outpatient clinics of the Internal Medicine Department of Selcuk University were also enrolled as control subjects. They were subject to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the patients. HD patients were receiving thrice-weekly dialysis for a 4 h period with a standard bicarbonate-containing dialysate bath using a biocompatible HD membrane (Polysulfone, FX-80 series, Fresenius, Germany). Dialysate flow rates were 500 mL/min and blood flow rates were 250–300 mL/min. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of patients and healthy subjects were measured in the upright sitting position after ≥5 min of rest using an Erka sphygmomanometer (PMS Instruments Limited, Berkshire, UK) with an appropriate cuff size.

CAC is a part of extended state of VC which can be detected even in early years of patients with ESRD.[27] CACS is regarded as an index of the severity of atherosclerotic vascular disease, helps to anatomically assess the CAD, and may also predict future adverse CV events, especially in patients on dialysis.[28] Individuals with diabetic nephropathy have a significantly higher prevalence and severity of CACS when compared with diabetics with normoalbuminuria.[29] Mehrotra et al.[30] evaluated the progression of CACS in diabetic CKD patients and reported that CACS were more likely to be progressive among individuals with diabetic nephropathy when compared with normoalbuminuric diabetic controls. In the present study, total CACS were increased in both diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients when compared with healthy subjects and CAC measurements were found to be significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">EAT and intra-abdominal visceral fat depots originate from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm.[31] Mazurek et al.[13] concluded that like abdominal visceral adipose tissue, EAT is also metabolically active by secreting proinflammatory cytokines and utilizing the free fatty acids (FFAs). Under ischemic conditions, EAT provides FFAs for the increased metabolism of myocardium.[32] However, in normal conditions EAT acts as a buffering system by scavenging excess FFA that is toxic to myocardium.[33] In ESRD patients, proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1-β, and IL-6 were generally increased and these cytokines were found to be associated with both atherosclerosis and increased CACS.[[22]]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In our study, EAT measurements were increased in both diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients when compared with healthy subjects and also EAT volume was significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients. Increased EAT measured by MDCT was also correlated with CACS in ESRD patients. These findings were consistent with the previous studies. Wang et al.[34] demonstrated that EAT volume was significantly higher in patients with type 2 DM than in nondiabetic subjects. The close anatomical relationship between EAT and the coronary arteries, combined with other evidence indicating that EAT is a biologically active adipokine-secreting tissue, suggests that EAT participates in the pathogenesis of diabetic coronary atherosclerosis.[[19], [34]]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Ix and Sharma[35] concluded that there is a link between obesity, CKD, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targher et al.[36] showed an association between NAFLD and CKD in patients with type-2 DM. However, in the present study, there was no difference between ESRD patients and healthy subjects in terms of BMI and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase. We therefore assumed that our patients did not have NAFLD.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Despite the simplicity of evaluating EAT with echocardiography,[37] EAT should be measured in three dimensions by MDCT: regional thickness, cross-sectional area, and total volume.[[33], [38]] Therefore, MDCT can be used to assess both CAC and EAT in ESRD patients at a high risk of CVD. Echocardiography has been used for the measurement of EAT with a higher reproducibility and reliability in the general population, but there are no data about echocardiography for the assessment of EAT in ESRD patients.[37] The lower cost, simplicity, and rapidity of echocardiography could make it the preferred measurement method for EAT.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our study had some limitations: first, this was a cross-sectional analysis of CACS and EAT in ESRD patients. Second, the sample size was relatively small. Both CACS and EAT measurements were found to be higher in ESRD patients when compared with healthy subjects; however, this difference was not statistically significant. This can be attributed to the small size of study population. Another potential limitation was that CT could not determine whether calcium was in the intima or media of the arterial wall. Since this is not a prospective controlled study, we cannot draw cause and effect relations from our findings.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There are many missing pieces in the puzzle. Further clinical and experimental studies are needed to determine the relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"><strong><em>Declaration of interest</em></strong>: The authors report no conflicts of interest.

The aim of our study was to analyze the association between the pre-defined potential risk factors and the status of various arterial calcifications in our HD patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In a cross-sectional study of 150 patients (91 male, mean age 54.55 +/- 12.46 yrs, HD duration 104.77 +/- 68.02 mths) we first determined the presence of AIC and AMC using plain radiography of the pelvis. We then compared the percentages of different radiogram findings in patients stratified according to various cut-off levels or the codes of each clinical and biochemical parameter (mean value of one year laboratory data recorded in the files).<br /><strong>Results: </strong>We determined arterial calcifications in 77.3% of our patients (AIC in 45.3%, AMC in 32%). The significantly higher frequencies of arterial calcifications of both groups (AIC and/or AMC) and isolated AIC presence were found in patients older than 55 at inclusion and 45 at the start of treatment with HD, with a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 4.5 mg/L, predominantly of male gender with diabetes. The patients with a significantly higher occurrence of arterial calcifications had lower percentages of total serum calcium (Ca) levels but within the K/DOQI guideline recommendations. Also, we found a significantly higher proportion of isolated AIC presence in the group of patients with corrected total serum Ca levels &gt; 2.35 mmol/L and serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels out of the range proposed by K/DOQI guidelines. In parallel, a significantly higher percentage of absence of arterial calcifications (ACA) was obtained in the patients with corrected total serum Ca levels &lt; 2.35 mmol/L, body mass index (BMI) &lt; 23 kg/m(2), mean pulse pressure &lt; 60 mmHg, blood leucocytes &lt; 6.5 x 10(9)L and serum triglycerides &lt; 1.8 mmol/L. Finally, we found a significantly higher presence of isolated AMC in patients with mean Kt/V &lt; 1.3 (poor dialysis adequacy), serum triglycerides &gt; 1.8 mmol/L and outside K/DOQI guideline achievements for corrected total serum Ca. In the 12 month period data analyzed, there were no significant differences in other risk factors such as the dose of prescribed calcium carbonate and vitamin D3, serum levels of albumin, cholesterol, phosphate (P) and Ca x P product.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>AIC and AMC were frequently present in our HD population. Age, gender, BMI, diabetes, pulse pressure, dialysis adequacy, serum CRP, triglycerides, Ca and iPTH, as well as blood leucocyte levels were associated with the occurrence of arterial calcifications in our HD patients.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19259046&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19259046&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19259046&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Factors associated with various arterial calcifications in haemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. After the adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini score.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>This study suggests that in a relatively young population with mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for extent of CAD.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20576822&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20576822&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=20576822&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Fibroblast growth factor 23 and fetuin A are independent predictors for the coronary artery disease extent in mild chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

They were classified according to the degree of abdominal aortic calcification (severe and non-severe), grouped per age (&lt;65, 65-75, and &gt;75 years), and matched. Survival curves were generated, and between-group differences were evaluated.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Overall, 164 patients were included. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were not significantly different between the severity groups, whereas there were significant differences in age ( P  &lt; 0.001), sex ( P  = 0.017), and presence of diabetes mellitus ( P  &lt; 0.001), hypertension ( P  &lt; 0.001), dyslipidemia ( P  = 0.048), and maintenance dialysis ( P  = 0.001). The severe abdominal aortic calcification group showed significantly poorer prognosis than the non-severe group (log-rank P  = 0.009). The adjusted odds ratio of severe calcification was the highest in patients aged &lt;65 years (7.167; 95% confidence interval, 1.042-49.28, P  = 0.045). Twenty-eight patients from each group were matched. The 90-day survival rate of the severe calcification group remained significantly lower than that of the non-severe calcification group (53.6% [15/28] versus 82.1% [23/28], P  = 0.022).<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Severe abdominal aortic calcification is associated with the 90-day mortality of sepsis patients, particularly among those aged &lt;65 years. Thus, caution is necessary in patients younger than 65 years; they may need to be treated with as much care as the elderly.<br />© 2021 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to compare arterial inflammation using 18 F-FDG PET/CT in patients with CKD and in matched controls.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>This restrospective study included 128 patients undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer history. CKD was defined according to guidelines using a calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. Background FDG uptake (venous, subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact of CKD on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in matched controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 ± 0.49 vs. 2.16 ± 0.43; p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR (r = -0.299, p = 0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in patients with CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not differ between groups. Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in patients with CKD compared to controls after correcting for muscle and fat background, and also remained significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Moderate CKD is associated with increased arterial inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, the increased arterial inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular events.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26464074&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26464074&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26464074&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Increased arterial inflammation in individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Methods: This cross-sectional, single-center study prospectively enrolled 44 consecutive CKD patients (57% male gender, 54.1 (95%CI, 49.7-58.6) years, median eGFR 28.1 (15.0-47.7) mL/min) diagnosed by renal biopsy during 6 months in our clinic. RRI, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), Kauppila score for abdominal aortic calcification (AACs) were assessed. Traditional and nontraditional atheroscleosis risk factors were also evaluated. Results: Most of the patients had a diagnosis of glomerular nephropathy, with IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy being the most frequent. RRI increased proportionally with CKD stages. Patients with RRI &gt;0.7 (39%) were older, had diabetic and vascular nephropathies more frequently, higher mean arterial blood pressure, increased systemic atherosclerosis burden (IMT and AACs), higher percentage of global glomerulosclerois, GBM thickness, arteriolosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy. RRI directly correlated with age (rs = 0.55, p  &lt; 0.001) and with all the studied atherosclerosis markers (clinical atherosclerosis score rs = 0.50, p  = 0.02; AACs rs = 0.50, p  &lt; 0.01; IMT rs = 0.34, p  = 0.02). Also, global glomerulosclerosis (rs = 0.31, p  = 0.03) and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (rs = 0.35, p  = 0.01) were directly correlated with RRI. In multivariable adjusted binomial logistic regression models, only arteriolosclerosis was retained as independent predictor of RRI &gt;0.7. Conclusion: The analysis of RRI may be useful in the evaluation of the general vascular condition of the patient with CKD, supplying information about both microvascular and macrovascular impairment. Moreover, RRI correlates well with renal histopathologic characteristics, particularly with arteriolosclerosis.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31599199&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31599199&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=31599199&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Intrarenal resistive index conundrum: systemic atherosclerosis versus renal arteriolosclerosis.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Data suggest that the RRI reflects the intrinsic state of vascular and parenchymal renal abnormalities. However, the resistive index also depends on central hemodynamic factors like the aortic pulse pressure and aortic stiffness [[<a id="bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1" id="ref_linkbib1" title="1">1</a>]]. The relative contributions of renal histologic features and central hemodynamic factors to the RRI remain unclear [[<a id="bib7up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib7" id="ref_linkbib7" title="7">7</a>]]. Moreover, the studies investigating the relationship between biopsy-proven kidney lesions and RRI had conflicting results. Some authors found that only arteriolosclerosis out of all histological parameters independently correlates with RRI, while others found that glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions are the strongest predictors of RRI [[<a id="bib8up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="8">8</a>]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Therefore, we performed a prospective study to evaluate in detail the relationship between biopsy-proven kidney lesions, subclinical markers of atherosclerosis and intrarenal resistive index in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.</p><a id="AN0140918837-3"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-3" title="Methods">Methods</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" /><a id="AN0140918837-4"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-4" title="Subjects">Subjects</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This prospective, cross-sectional study enrolled 44 consecutive patients referred to "Dr. Carol Davila" Teaching Hospital of Nephrology, Bucharest, Romania in a 6-month period, who underwent a diagnosis kidney biopsy.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Inclusion criteria were a biopsy-proven chronic kidney disease with a light microscopic specimen that included more than 5 glomeruli, age older than 18 years, and sufficient clinical data. Exclusion criteria were acute kidney injury, hepatic disease, valvular heart disease, renal artery stenosis, and urinary tract obstruction and refusal to give an informed consent.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The following data at kidney biopsy were available: age, mean arterial pressure (MAP defined as diastolic blood pressure plus 1/3 of pulse pressure), presence of hypertension (defined as a blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive agents), inflammatory status (serum hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein), lipid profile (serum cholesterol and triglycerides), serum albumin, eGFR (four variable CKD-EPI formula), proteinuria (24-h urine protein-to-creatinine ratio - UPCR) and hematuria (red blood cells per milliliter).</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In order to evaluate the atherosclerotic burden, we used a semiquantitative score based on the clinical involvement of cerebral, carotid, coronary and peripheral vascular territories. Each affected territory was scored with one point; the maximum score was four. Patients were considered to suffer from coronary artery disease after coronary artery bypass surgery or in the presence of at least one diameter stenosis in coronary angiography; cerebrovascular disease if they had a previous ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic attack; carotid artery disease if they had previously undergone carotid surgery or if a significant stenosis could be detected by duplex sonography; peripheral artery disease was diagnosed after a previous peripheral revascularisation or if an ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9 could be detected in at least one pedal artery.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Abdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) were evaluated on a lateral lumbar X-ray (with the patient in standing position), as described by Kauppila [[11]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For intima media thickness (IMT) determination B-mode ultrasonography imaging of the carotid artery was performed with a transducer frequency of 7 MHz (Samsung HM70A, linear transducer L7-16). Up to 4 cm of the common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid 2 cm distally from bifurcation were scanned bilaterally using longitudinal and transverse sections. IMT was defined as the distance between the leading edge of the first echogenic line (lumen-intima interface) and the second echogenic line (media-adventitia interface) in plaque-free arterial segments [[12]]. All measurements were performed by the same independent examiner under blind conditions.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For Doppler ultrasonography examination a real-time ultrasound device with color Doppler capacity (Samsung HM70A) and a 3.5 MHz convex-type transducer (CA1-7AD) were used. The examination was performed early in the morning, after 8-h overnight fast, with the patient in supine position and after at least 15 min rest. The signals were obtained from interlobar and arcuate arteries in the upper, middle, and lower parts of the kidney. The RRI was calculated as [(peak- systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity]. The RRI value for each kidney was the mean of all 6 measurements. A mean RRI value was obtained for each patient by averaging the two kidneys' mean RRIs (Spearman correlation coefficient between the two kidneys RRI measurements was 0,95, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). The use of antihypertensive medication was not suspended before RRI measurement. Ultrasonographic examination that included RRI assessment was performed the day before the renal biopsy. In order to avoid inter-observer variability, all Doppler examinations were performed by the same examiner who was unaware of the study or the clinical details of the patients.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (registration number: 2017 LL UMF 07).

To our knowledge this is the first report to address the full spectrum of intrarenal lesions. We found that RRI was associated with the atherosclerotic burden, global glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy and arteriolosclerosis. However, after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors only arteriolosclerosis was independently associated with RRI.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The studies on the relationship between histopathological findings and RRI in renal disease had conflicting results. Most of the studies did not include an evaluation of all renal compartments, i.e., glomeruli, tubulo-interstitium, and vascular. Moreover, histopathologic assessment was performed based only on a dichotomous scale or used vague criteria. In order to overcome these limitations, we studied all these components concurrently as damages are closely related to each other and their influence on RRI could be cumulative.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">According to Ikee <em>et al</em>, only arteriolosclerosis out of all histologically studied parameters independently correlated with RRI in CKD [[<a id="bib8up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="8">8</a>]]. Another study, performed in patients with renal parenchymal disease, showed that RRI was associated in order of significance with the degree of arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, edema and focal interstitial fibrosis [[15]]. Moreover, in 202 chronic kidney disease patients who underwent kidney biopsy, Hanamura <em>et al</em> found a significant relationship of RRI with glomerulosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and tubulo-interstitial damage [[10]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Remarkably, arteriolosclerosis seems to be the only kidney biopsy finding that, in most of the studies, was independently correlated with the increase in RRI. Our results are in line with these observations: we found that only arteriolosclerosis was retained as an independent determinant of RRI after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is a common vascular lesion, found in many different situations, including aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. It is generated by the accumulation of serum proteins in the subendothelial space, often extending into the media [[16]]. Arteriolosclerosis appears to be related to the loss of glomerular autoregulation and, furthermore, to participate in the pathogenesis of the associated glomerular lesions [[17]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In accord with other reports, we found that high RRI values are related to more severe tubulo-interstitial damage score, probably due to the increased stiffness of renal vessels due to interstitial fibrosis. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis correlate closely with renal function and long term prognosis, which may underlie the utility of RRI as an independent marker of renal and clinical outcome in CKD [[<a id="bib9up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9" title="9">9</a>]]. Moreover, in a recent large study on 992 patients, the tubulo-interstitial score was associated with intrarenal resistivity index [[18]]. However, despite the large cohort, the results could be hampered by the improper adjustment to covariates in multivariate analysis and by the histologic evaluation, limited only to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage scores [[18]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In earlier reports, glomerulosclerosis association with increased RRI was not constant. Only one of the former studies reported a significant direct association of RRI with glomerulosclerosis. However, RRI was significantly lower when the glomerular involvement was isolated, i.e., not associated with any vascular and/or tubulo-interstitial damage [[<a id="bib8up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib8" id="ref_linkbib8" title="8">8</a>], [15], [19]]. In our cohort, global glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial lesions were directly correlated with RRI. Yet, global glomerulosclerosis might be an effect of senescence. Furthermore, in the multivariable analysis this associations were confounded by age, diabetes mellitus and renal function. Taken together, these findings suggest that RRI is not directly related to the glomerular lesions or to the extension of tubulo-interstitial damage.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As previously reported [[15], [19], [21]], we found a positive correlation between RRI and age. While in univariable analysis AAC score and IMT were related to RRI, after adjustment for the traditional cardiovascular risk factors this relationship disappeared. This suggests that the rise in RRI reflects more the vascular consequences of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. This is in line with other reports, where RRI was considered a marker of target organ damage in essential arterial hypertension [[24]]. Furthermore, other studies demonstrated that high RRI was also associated with systemic atherosclerosis in diabetic patients [[27]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In chronic kidney disease patients, many authors found a RRI of 0.70 or higher to be an independent risk factor for CKD progression regardless of the baseline eGFR, proteinuria, or arterial hypertension [[29]]. These results were confirmed in CKD patients at 2 and 4-years follow-up. Accordingly, we can assume that RRI of 0.70 or higher in chronic nephropathies could identify subjects with irreversible parenchymal damage [[30]]. In line with these results, we found that RRI increased with CKD stages. Moreover, proteinuria and hematuria were not related to RRI. Thus, arteriolosclerosis is likely to be the key culprit of a pathological RRI, since it is an irreversible lesion which impairs glomerular autoregulation [[16]].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, the data resulted from a cross-sectional design with a small sample size from a single center, which can limit the statistical power. Second, the selection criteria for kidney biopsy influenced the composition of the cohort, i.e., we included mostly patients with glomerular nephropathies and only a few had vascular and tubulo-interstitial diseases. However, the final cohort reasonably describes the patients seen in daily practice. Finally, Doppler ultrasonography is an operator dependent method; nevertheless, the risk of inter-observer variability was reduced in our study because only one experienced examiner performed all ultrasound assessments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, the analysis of intrarenal resistivity index may be useful in the evaluation of the general vascular condition of the patient with CKD, supplying information about both microvascular and macrovascular impairment. Moreover, RRI correlates well with renal histopathologic characteristics, particularly with arteriolosclerosis.</p><a id="AN0140918837-9"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-9" title="Ethics approval">Ethics approval</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee at which the studies were conducted and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</p><a id="AN0140918837-10"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-10" title="Informed consent">Informed consent</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p><a id="AN0140918837-11"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-11" title="Disclosure statement">Disclosure statement</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p><a id="AN0140918837-12"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0140918837-12" title="Data Availability">Data Availability</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p><a id="AN0140918837-13"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="ref_toc" title=" References  "> References  </a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a>  Radermacher J, Mengel M, Ellis S, et al.

(English) By: Ruderman I; Smith ER; Toussaint ND; Hewitson TD; Holt SG, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2018 May 15; Vol. 19 (1), pp. 113; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 29764395; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve dialysis patients.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p &lt; 0.001]), serum calcium (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p &lt; 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality rate of 19% (n = 13).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29764395&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29764395&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=29764395&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Longitudinal changes in bone and mineral metabolism after cessation of cinacalcet in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Metry G; Stenvinkel P; Qureshi AR; Carrero JJ; Yilmaz MI; Bárány P; Snaedal S; Heimbürger O; Lindholm B; Suliman ME, European journal of clinical investigation [Eur J Clin Invest], ISSN: 1365-2362, 2008 Nov; Vol. 38 (11), pp. 804-11; Publisher: Wiley; PMID: 19021697; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote vascular calcification.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>We investigated the impact of inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Serum fetuin correlated negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (&lt; median) had higher mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P &lt; 0.001), but this association was lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and inflammation (CRP &gt; median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD patients.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19021697&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19021697&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19021697&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Low serum fetuin-A concentration predicts poor outcome only in the presence of inflammation in prevalent haemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) is common in PAD but its impact on subsequent health is poorly described. We aimed to determine the association between a LLAC score and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>LLAC scoring, and the established Bollinger score, were derived from a database of unenhanced CT scans, from patients presenting with symptomatic PAD. We determined the association between these scores outcomes. The primary outcome was combined cardiac mortality and morbidity (CM/M) with a secondary outcome of all-cause mortality.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>220 patients (66% male; median age 69 years) were included with follow-up for a median 46 [IQR 31-64] months. Median total LLAC scores were higher in those patients suffering a primary outcome (6831 vs. 1652; p = 0.012). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.039), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.028), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.026) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.012) were more common in patients in the highest quartile of LLAC scores. The area under the curve of the receiver operator curve for the LLAC score was greater (0.929: 95% CI [0.884-0.974]) than for the Bollinger score (0.824: 95% CI [0.758-0.890]) for the primary outcome. A LLAC score ≥ 4400 had the best diagnostic accuracy to determine the outcome measure.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This is the largest study to investigate links between lower limb arterial calcification and cardiovascular events in symptomatic PAD.

(English) By: Moldovan D; Rusu C; Kacso IM; Potra A; Patiu IM; Gherman-Caprioara M, Clujul medical (1957) [Clujul Med], ISSN: 1222-2119, 2016; Vol. 89 (1), pp. 94-103; Publisher: Universitatea de Medicina si Farmacie "Iuliu Hatieganu" Cluj Napoca; PMID: 27004031; <br /><strong>Background and Aim: </strong>In spite of numerous interventions, the control of mineral disturbances remains poor in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between mineral and bone disorders (MBD) and their components impact on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CDV) mortality and morbidity in chronic dialysis patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>This prospective study was carried out in a cohort of 92 randomly selected patients with ESRF treated with hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, including vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral). The follow-up lasted 40 months and the final evaluation included the number and causes of deaths, CDV events and disease. Serum Ca, P, ALP, iPTH, albumin, cholesterol, urea and creatinine levels were measured. The plain radiographic films of hands and pelvis evaluated all bone abnormalities suggestive of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) and peripheral vascular calcification (VC).<br /><strong>Results: </strong>All-cause annual mortality represented 9.25% in HD and 9.09% in PD patients. The CDV mortality represented almost 44% in HD patients and 66% in PD patients from all deaths. There was a high prevalence of CDV diseases and events. High and low serum P levels were associated with a worse survival rate. Hypercalcaemia was associated with high risk for CDV events in HD patients. In PD patients, the relationship between increased ALP levels and all-cause mortality was significant. Other mineral markers were not predictive of the outcome in the studied patients. In the HD patients the severity of VC was associated with all-cause and CDV mortality, and with CDV events. Male gender, hypercholesterolemia, decreased URR, albumin and creatinine were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. The diabetics had higher death rates. Low dialysis efficacy represented a risk factor for mortality and CDV diseases and events. In PD patients, low albumin induced a higher death rate. In PD patients the death rate was similar to HD patients.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>All-cause mortality was higher than in general population, but lower than the chronic dialysis patients' mortality reported in other studies. The death rates in HD and PD patients were similar. VC and serum P levels influenced the outcome in the HD patients - increased the risk for all-cause and CDV mortality, but also for CDV events. ALP levels influenced outcome in PD patients. There were no significant differences between HD and PD patients regarding outcome.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27004031&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27004031&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27004031&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Mineral and bone disorders, morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal failure patients on chronic dialysis.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Specific risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional factors do not fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The potential use of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis has to be determined.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were also recruited. Demographical, clinical and analytical data were collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a single trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Differences in age, sex and prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found between controls and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described in epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted); earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of atheromatous plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted analysis. A group of patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, and would have gone underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages, and a higher rate of ABI &gt;1.4 than &lt;0.9, suggesting more vascular calcification.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual prevalence of subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important information to the pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to non-CKD subjects.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25326683&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25326683&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25326683&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Observational multicenter study to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of subclinical atheromatosis in a Spanish chronic kidney disease cohort: baseline data from the NEFRONA study.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

This study evaluated the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. CAC (calcium score &gt; 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p &lt; 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 85.0 cm3, p&lt;0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25479288&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25479288&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25479288&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Pericardial fat is associated with coronary artery calcification in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Araki N; Misawa S; Shibuya K; Ota S; Oide T; Kawano A; Beppu M; Nakatani Y; Kuwabara S, Orphanet journal of rare diseases [Orphanet J Rare Dis], ISSN: 1750-1172, 2016 Apr 12; Vol. 11, pp. 35; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 27068711; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of the controls (P &lt; 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause of calciphylaxis.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27068711&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27068711&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=27068711&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;POEMS syndrome and calciphylaxis: an unrecognized cause of abnormal small vessel calcification.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Hashemi J; Joshaghani HR; Akaberi A; Hesari Z; Ghanbari R; Mohammadzadeh M; Golshan AR, Archives of Iranian medicine [Arch Iran Med], ISSN: 1735-3947, 2017 Dec 01; Vol. 20 (12), pp. 752-755; Publisher: Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R. Iran; PMID: 29664315; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant only in the patient group.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.<br />2017 The Author(s).

(English) By: Bohn E; Tangri N; Gali B; Henderson B; Sood MM; Komenda P; Rigatto C, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2013 Dec 01; Vol. 14, pp. 263; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 24289833; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Eight hundred and twenty-four dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p&lt;0.05.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges were based on 95% confidence intervals.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve prognostication in this population.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24289833&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24289833&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=24289833&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

It is linked with rapid progression of kidney disease, increased morbidity and mortality hence the imperative to start anti-hypertensive medication when blood pressure (BP) is persistently &gt; 90(th) percentile for age, gender, and height in non-dialyzing hypertensive children with CKD. HTN pathomechanism in CKD is multifactorial and complexly interwoven. The patient with CKD-associated HTN needs to be carefully evaluated for co-morbidities that frequently alter the course of the disease as successful treatment of HTN in CKD goes beyond life style modification and anti-hypertensive therapy alone. Chronic anaemia, volume overload, endothelial dysfunction, arterial media calcification, and metabolic derangements like secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphataemia, and calcitriol deficiency are a few co-morbidities that may cause or worsen HTN in CKD. It is important to know if the HTN is caused or made worse by the toxic effects of medications like erythropoietin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Poor treatment response may be due to any of these co-morbidities and medications. A satisfactory hypertensive CKD outcome, therefore, depends very much on identifying and managing these co-morbid conditions and HTN promoting medications promptly and appropriately. This review attempts to point attention to factors that may affect successful treatment of the hypertensive CKD child and how to attain the desired therapeutic BP target.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26558187&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26558187&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26558187&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Pre-treatment considerations in childhood hypertension due to chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

The Lebanese medical journal [J Med Liban], ISSN: 0023-9852, 2011 Jul-Sep; Vol. 59 (3), pp. 117-21; Publisher: Order Of Physicians In Lebanon; PMID: 22259897; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis. They have been linked to numerous risk factors and have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients in our tertiary care center and to identify the associated risk factors.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In the current study, we reviewed the charts of 43 patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center. We estimated the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients using plain X-ray of the hand as the screening tool. We compared patient's characteristics and tried to identify possible risk factors, with a special emphasis on the subgroup of patients with diabetes.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Vascular calcifications were prevalent among half of the patients on hemodialysis. Duration of dialysis (p = 0.02), diabetes (p &lt; 0.001), and hypertension (p = 0.01) were highly associated with vascular calcifications. No association was found between vascular calcifications and age, gender, calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, smoking, and lipid control. In multivariate analyses, diabetes and duration of dialysis were the only independent predictors of vascular calcifications and diabetics developed vascular calcifications earlier than nondiabetics (31 months vs 69 months).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Vascular calcifications are moderately prevalent among patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center, and were found to be strongly correlated with diabetes and duration of dialysis. A larger, multicenter, prospective study should be conducted at national level, in order to confirm the findings of this study and to identify further modifiable risk factors, to decrease the incidence of vascular calcifications and the incurring cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in our population.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22259897&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22259897&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22259897&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Prevalence of peripheral vascular calcifications in patients on chronic hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Beirut: a pilot study.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

There are limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl).<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>In this prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m 2 ] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) completed follow-up. There were no differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p &lt; 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV &gt; 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28870151&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28870151&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28870151&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with changes in bone mineral markers in advanced CKD.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Preclinical studies have evidenced an association between serum levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and vascular alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a cohort of CKD patients.<br /><strong>Design, Setting, Participants, &amp; Measurements: </strong>One-hundred and thirty-nine patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at different stages of CKD (8% at stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at stage 5, and 32% at stage 5D) were enrolled.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Baseline IS levels presented an inverse relationship with renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification and pulse wave velocity. During the follow-up period (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly because of cardiovascular events (n = 18). In crude survival analyses, the highest IS tertile was a powerful predictor of overall and cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively).

This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of &gt; 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p &lt;  0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001).

However, whether high circulating Scl is also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>we measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were included.

There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve these patients survival needs to be determined.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25465028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25465028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=25465028&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Serum sclerostin is an independent predictor of mortality in hemodialysis patients.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Morisawa T; Nakagomi A; Kohashi K; Kusama Y; Shimizu W, Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis [J Atheroscler Thromb], ISSN: 1880-3873, 2017 Oct 01; Vol. 24 (10), pp. 1058-1068; Publisher: Japan Atherosclerosis Society; PMID: 28428481; <br /><strong>Aims: </strong>Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>A total of 71 CAD patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) and 28 age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were classified into quartiles.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b level.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28428481&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28428481&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=28428481&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Serum Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase-5b Levels are Associated with the Severity and Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

(English) By: Anwar Z; Zan E; Carone M; Ozturk A; Sozio SM; Yousem DM, The Indian journal of radiology &amp; imaging [Indian J Radiol Imaging], ISSN: 1998-3808, 2011 Jul; Vol. 21 (3), pp. 215-20; Publisher: Medknow Publications Pvt. Ltd; PMID: 22013298; <br /><strong>Background and Purpose: </strong>Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA) calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We sought to determine the association between the risk factors for vascular calcification and this rare phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure, and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a discharge diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head examinations were reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes).<br /><strong>Results: </strong>STA calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208; P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to STA calcification (P=0.221).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to STA calcification but has the strongest association with diabetes mellitus.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22013298&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22013298&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=22013298&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Superficial temporal artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: Association with vascular risk factors and ischemic cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET is described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore studied ET after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of optimized antihypertensive therapy (AHT).<br /><strong>Design, Setting, Participants, &amp; Measurements: </strong>We recruited 40 hypertensive nondiabetic patients (≥70 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 and hypertensive non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was performed after complete AHT washout and repeated after AHT reintroduction to target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by applanation tonometry, central hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave analysis, vascular calcification (VC) by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Mean age was 76 ± 5 years, estimated GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 ± 14 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was 128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 ± 0.011 EU/ml and was independent of renal function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial stiffness, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased with AHT (to 0.020 ± 0.028 EU/ml; P &lt; 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = -0.38; P = 0.02), arterial wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 0.01), and degree of tonic vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = -0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC, PWV, gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Elderly patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. Improvement of their CV status with optimized AHT is associated with a significant reduction in endotoxemia. Further investigation of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking CV disease and CKD with this previously unappreciated effect of AHT appears warranted.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21852662&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21852662&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=21852662&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;The impact of antihypertensive drug therapy on endotoxemia in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients on HD.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) and low (&lt;75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic analysis.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of &lt; 90.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Our results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the progression of aortic calcification.

(English) By: Misra PS; Alam A; Lipman ML; Nessim SJ, BMC nephrology [BMC Nephrol], ISSN: 1471-2369, 2015 Aug 13; Vol. 16, pp. 136; Publisher: BioMed Central; PMID: 26268579; <br /><strong>Background: </strong>Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels.<br /><strong>Methods: </strong>Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>55 % of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p &lt; 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level &lt; 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level &lt; 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067).<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26268579&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26268579&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=26268579&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium concentration among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:

We aimed to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71.

We found out that eGFR 1year correlated with eGFR discharge and calcium based on hospital discharge data (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFR discharge (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR 1year than AoAC combined with recipient eGFR discharge (R-squared 0.35, p = .006).

Recent studies imply that vascular calcification (VC) is an important predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients [,,,,] and is detected for more than 50% predialysis patients and for 80-90% patients with ESRD [10,11]. As in ESRD patients, VC in KT recipients strongly predicts post-transplant cardiovascular outcomes [12].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Interrelationship between aortic calcification and aortic stiffness [13,14], a hallmark of vascular aging [15], have been shown in ESRD patients. Sekikawa et al. have observed that the association of aortic calcification with stiffness begins as early as the 40s in healthy individuals [16], also another study has proved progression of coronary artery calcification in ESRD patients undergoing dialysis at the 30s [17]. Results of previous studies suggest that aorta calcification is associated with decreased GFR in patients with stages 3-5 CKD [18,19]. Aortic smooth muscle cell calcification is known to be associated with excess phosphate influenced by lower urinary excretion in ERSD patients [20,21]. There are few studies which have evaluated post-transplant PWV in the context of VC [,,].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The pathogenesis of VC could involve either the intima layer, linking to inflammation and atherosclerosis, or the media layer, causing vascular stiffness [25]. Vascular calcification is available to screen with a number of noninvasive imaging techniques. Even though, electron beam computer tomography and multi-detector row computer tomography are known as a gold standards for assessment of the extent of VC [,,,], they are lacking in cost-effectiveness and simplicity of technique routinely performed in clinical practice. Ogawa et al. proposed a simple scale combined with chest radiography for evaluation of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) [30], which has proved to be an efficient tool in screening of AoAC and identifying patients at the risk of cardiovascular events [31,32].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Many present prospective observational studies focus on evaluation of coronary artery calcification [12], but there are still very few studies that have examined the cost-efficient AoAC detection on chest X-ray in routine practice and its association with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [24]. Additionally, there are no studies which evaluate pretransplant VC in the context of posttransplant allograft function. Safar et al. reported that first year after KT recipient eGFR decline was significantly linked to smoking and acute rejection and after nine years of follow up - to donor age and donor aortic stiffness [33]. We hypothesized that due to possible reabsorption of VC after kidney transplant there could be increase in serum calcium concentration which together with other factors causes compensatory polyuria and increase in eGFR. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether pretransplant AoAC grade or arterial stiffness can predict cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs) and post-transplant renal graft function.</p><a id="AN0134652276-3"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0134652276-3" title="Methods">Methods</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph" /><a id="AN0134652276-4"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0134652276-4" title="Study population and design">Study population and design</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Single-center observational prospective study of 60 deceased KT recipients was performed in Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos between November 2015 and December 2016.

Each participant should have been older than 18 years, without previous history of CVEs (ischemic stroke), cardiovascular events and diseases (myocardial infarction, clinically evident ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation) and without clinically evident peripheral artery disease (ankle‐brachial index was &gt;0.9). All 37 KT recipients who met the inclusion criteria were studied before KT, at the day of discharge from hospital and after a median 12 months follow-up. One patient died within first month of observation. All procedures performed in this study were performed with all the subjects' written informed consent and were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Lithuanian Bioethics Committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Our study did not influence the choice of initial or maintenance immunosuppressive treatment.

We measured body height and weight and calculated body mass index (BMI) by using formula weight/height<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Blood tests were drawn at the time of admission to the hospital for KT, at the time of discharging from hospital after successful KT and after one-year follow-up. They included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, urea, calcium, ionized calcium, phosphorus, parathormone, albumin, total cholesterol, uric acid, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation: eGFR<sub>discharge</sub> - based on creatinine level at the time of discharging from hospital and eGFR<sub>1year</sub> - based on creatinine 1-year after KT. Data about cardiovascular events within follow-up were also calculated. Cardiovascular events were defined as primary end-point. Bearing in mind, that eGFR is a predictor of long-term kidney graft function, we decided to determine the factors which could forecast the eGFR<sub>1year</sub>.</p><a id="AN0134652276-6"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0134652276-6" title="Vascular parameters">Vascular parameters</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Before KT, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) were measured by trained medical doctor for three times, with 2 min interval, in supine position after 15 min resting with manual BP monitor (Riester precisa<sup>®</sup> N Sphygmomanometer, Jungingen, Germany ) on the arm without arterio-venous fistula and average value was recorded.

Each radiologist counted the calcification affected sectors. After initial evaluation, Cohen's kappa coefficient between experts was 0.71.

In our study, 52.78% of the patients presented AoAC. The cfPWV is considered as the 'gold standard' of aortic stiffness measurement and there are many data proving its association with cardiovascular outcomes [39,40]. Previous studies showed no change of aortic PWV in KT patients [41,42], in contrast Zoungas et al. reported amelioration of peripheral PWV 1-year after KT [43]. Moreover, there are few studies considering the PWV ratio as more valuable prognostic factor of mortality than cfPWV [34]. In addition to this, we have found that PWV ratio may predict cardiovascular events. Also, our study has explored the differences of vascular parameters before and 1-year after KT, which have showed the improvement in aortic PWV and BP observed in other similar studies [44].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Comparing to the general population, cardiovascular disease plays more pivotal role in KT recipients, due to annual cardiovascular events risk of 3.5-5% [45]. Despite AoAC being considered as an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes [32], our data do not confirm that. In our population, only arterial stiffness was associated with cardiovascular events 1 year after KT. It could be explained by short follow-up, small study population and the exclusion of patients with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular history.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Vascular calcification is pathophysiologically related to inflammation, atherosclerosis, and vascular stiffness, which are usually observed in patients with ESRD [25]. We analyzed only several major risk factors for atherosclerosis before and after KT: hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, diabetes, age, inflammation, and CRP levels. Family history of early heart disease was absent in all patients. Besides, VC in large arteries per se is the expression of advanced atherosclerosis. Our study patients with confirmed pretransplant AoAC were older, had hypertension, but no significant difference in inflammatory markers, lipid profile, diabetes, and smoking prevalence.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">DeLoach et al. have reported association of CRP with aortic calcification in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), however, it has not proved by all studies [29,46]. Our findings show that pretransplant CRP may predict cardiovascular events which are in line with previous study [47].</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Abnormal bone and mineral metabolism tends to persist in most KTRs, even though a successful KT improves regulatory hormones levels and excretion of accumulated waste products and electrolytes [48]. The prevalence of hypercalcemia in kidney transplant patients is estimated up to 66% [49], though the methods to determine it vary. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia are resulted by parathormone induced calcium re-absorption and phosphorus excretion [50,51]. In our study, we observed that total serum calcium, but not ionized calcium, levels 1-year after KT were higher in patients with AoAC. It is known that hypercalcemia could be related to decline of transplanted kidney function in two ways: vasoconstriction and calcium deposition in tubulo-interstitium [,,]. Some studies suggest that hypercalcemia after KT could be caused by reabsorption of VC [55]. Moreover, high calcium concentration in blood and urine can impair sodium and water reabsorption leading to the compensatory enhancement of eGFR and polyuria. Our data show that 1-year after KT patients with AoAC have significantly higher calcium levels and nonsignificantly but higher eGFR at the same time. Our results suggest that pretransplant AoAC score after adjustment for recipient eGFR<sub>discharge</sub> independently correlates with recipient eGFR<sub>1year</sub>, but has worse descriptive value than recipient eGFR<sub>discharge</sub> combined with donor age and gender. Unfortunately, we did not measure urine calcium level and had no information about urine volume changes in our patients. Further research is needed to define the predictive role of AoAC progression to eGFR change and prognosis.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The limitations of this current research include small size of study population, which together with low number of cardiovascular events are related to weak statistical power in predicting the impact of AoAC and arterial stiffness on cardiovascular outcomes. This may be explained by enrollment of participants without previous history of cardiovascular/CVEs. On the other hand, it may represent better understanding of KT role in VC and its related outcomes. Future studies with larger sample sizes would be necessary to determine the interrelationship between AoAC, measured by more accessible in clinical practice and cost-effective X-ray, kidney function and cardiovascular events after KT with longer observation period.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In conclusion, AoAC is prevalent among kidney transplanted patients, but there is lack of evidence that pretransplant AoAC could predict early cardiovascular outcomes and decline of graft function in patients without previous history of cardiovascular/CVEs. Arterial stiffness and inflammation markers might be considered to have predictive value, but more data are needed for further risk stratification in renal transplant recipients.</p><a id="AN0134652276-11"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0134652276-11" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We thank Dr. Tetsuya Ogawa from Division of Blood Purification and Nephrology Department of Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical University Medical Center, for providing information about practical use of AoAC scale.

Hypertension was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure ≥140 and ≥90 mmHg, respectively, or the use of anti‐hypertensive medication. Smoking was defined as former or current smokers. Laboratory data including serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were calculated as an average of two values obtained at the time of enrolment and within the past 12 months. Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was obtained once at the time of enrolment. Blood samples were analyzed using a Dade Behring Dimension RxL analyzer (Siemens, Germany). Intact PTH was determined by an immunoradiometric assay (ELISA‐PTH, Cisbio International, France).

Although KT recipients exhibited higher total VC scores compared to CKD patients at all intervals of dialysis vintage, the differences did not reach statistical significance (Fig. [NaN] a). However, if only patients with calcification (total VC score &gt; 0) were included in analyses, a significant increase in the severity of VC in KT recipients was observed especially among those with dialysis vintage longer than 2 years (Fig. [NaN] b). There were no significant differences in age or the prevalence of DM or CVD between KT recipients and CKD patients in any of the subgroups. In order to determine the influence of time after kidney transplantation on the severity of VC, KT recipients with dialysis vintage longer than 2 years were categorized according to intervals of KT vintage (between 1–5 years or &gt;5 years) and the severity of VC was compared to CKD stages 5‐5D patients (Fig. [NaN] ). There were no significant differences in age or the prevalence of DM or CVD between CKD patients and KT recipients in either groups. A significant increase in the severity of VC was observed only in the subgroup of KT recipients with a transplant vintage longer than 5 years. Similar results were obtained when only data from patients with VC were analyzed. The prevalence of VC was similar across all groups.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Prevalence and severity of vascular calcification</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph"> <table><tr><th /><th>n (%)</th><th align="center">Vascular calcification scores (mean&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;SD)</th></tr><tr><th>All patients</th><th>Patients with score >&#x2009;0</th></tr><tr><td>Aortic Calcification</td><td /></tr><tr><td>KT</td><td>60 (45.5)</td><td>3.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.2</td><td>8.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.7</td></tr><tr><td>CKD 5&#x2010;5D</td><td>68 (52.7)</td><td>3.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5</td><td>6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;5.5</td></tr><tr><td>Pelvic Calcification</td><td /></tr><tr><td>KT</td><td>51 (38.6)</td><td>5.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.5</td><td>14.6&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;7.4</td></tr><tr><td>CKD 5&#x2010;5D</td><td>46 (35.7)</td><td>4.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.1</td><td>13.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8</td></tr><tr><td>Total Calcification</td><td /></tr><tr><td>KT</td><td>72 (54.5)</td><td>9.5&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;12.9</td><td>17.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;12.9</td></tr><tr><td>CKD 5&#x2010;5D</td><td>81 (62.8)</td><td>8.1&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.2</td><td>12.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.8</td></tr></table> </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">2 *P &lt; 0.05 versus CKD.

The similar prevalence of VC among the two populations suggested that, in KT recipients who had no calcification at baseline, the likelihood of developing VC after kidney transplantation was small. This observation has been reported by previous small longitudinal studies in incident KT recipients.[<a id="bib25up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib25" id="ref_linkbib25" title="25">25</a>] , [<a id="bib26up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib26" id="ref_linkbib26" title="26">26</a>] On the other hand, our data also suggested that, in those with VC at the time of transplantation, progression was likely to occur in long‐term despite the prolonged period of improvement of kidney function and mineral metabolism. As mentioned earlier, the pathogenesis of VC involves cellular transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast‐like cells; therefore, the transformation process may not be reversible. However, to confirm this hypothesis, a prospective study with adequate follow‐up time is required. Longer dialysis vintage was the major factor associated with a more substantial degree of VC after kidney transplantation.

The severity of VC became more pronounced among KT recipients with longer transplant vintage and was at least in part influenced by past dialysis experience.</p><a id="AN0095068693-12"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0095068693-12" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This work was supported by the Kidney Foundation of Thailand.</p><a id="AN0095068693-13"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="ref_toc" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em><a id="bib1"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link_bt" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib1up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;" id="bib_upbib1" title="1">1</a> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01293786 </em></p><a id="AN0095068693-14"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" id="ref_toc" title="References">References</a></span><p class="body-paragraph"><em>Chiu YW, Adler SG, Budoff MJ, Takasu J, Ashai J, Mehrotra R.

This percentage is higher than a study using conventional radiographs of the aorto‐iliac region and a different scoring technique, in which VC was identified in 24.4% of 1117 kidney transplant recipients.[<a id="bib18up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib18" id="ref_linkbib18" title="18">18</a>] However, other studies using electron‐beam computed tomography (EBCT)[<a id="bib19up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib19" id="ref_linkbib19" title="19">19</a>] and spiral CT<sup>20</sup> have reported up to 65% of patients with VC, and a prevalence rate of 81% was reported in the CORD study.[<a id="bib3up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="3">3</a>]</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Although patients in this study did not have active CVD and were younger than the general dialysis population, VC was associated with the same factors reported elsewhere: age, dialysis vintage and prior CVD.[<a id="bib2up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib2" id="ref_linkbib2" title="2">2</a>] , [<a id="bib3up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib3" id="ref_linkbib3" title="3">3</a>] , [<a id="bib20up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib20" id="ref_linkbib20" title="20">20</a>] However, these variables explained a relatively small percentage of VC causation, indicating the important role of other factors related to CKD that we did not identify.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As in other studies,[<a id="bib19up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib19" id="ref_linkbib19" title="19">19</a>] , [<a id="bib21up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib21" id="ref_linkbib21" title="21">21</a>] we detected no significant associations between VC and pre‐transplant values of serum calcium or phosphate in patients admitted for kidney transplants, and only weak associations in patients admitted for SPK transplantation.

However, uncoupling of balanced bone turnover is a major component of renal osteodystrophy, and either increased bone resorption or reduced formation may reduce mineral deposition in bone and predispose to medial calcification, supporting the inverse relationship of VC to BMD reported in a number of studies.[<a id="bib9up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib9" id="ref_linkbib9" title="9">9</a>] , [<a id="bib10up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib10" id="ref_linkbib10" title="10">10</a>] , [<a id="bib12up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib12" id="ref_linkbib12" title="12">12</a>] In this study, we did not detect inverse relationships of VC to age‐adjusted Z‐scores, or to values of PTH or bone turnover markers. In fact the only significant association was the weakly positive association of VC to lumbar spine Z‐scores that was likely to be caused by artefact from aortic VC and degenerative vertebral changes. Despite this lack of an inverse association, reduced BMD due to abnormal bone turnover or age‐related osteoporosis may certainly exacerbate VC in older individuals with CKD.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Patients in this study receiving SPK transplants were younger, with shorter dialysis vintage than kidney only transplant patients, but their VC prevalence and VC associations were similar. Due to inflammation and oxidative stress, diabetes may predispose to medial VC. Somewhat surprisingly, diabetes has not been consistently reported as a predisposing factor to VC,[<a id="bib5up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib5" id="ref_linkbib5" title="5">5</a>] , [<a id="bib6up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib6" id="ref_linkbib6" title="6">6</a>] possibly because patients on haemodialysis have high levels of advanced glycation end products regardless of diabetes status.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This study has a number of limitations. Because VC scores were assigned by different investigators there is a possibility of inconsistency. However, inter‐observer reproducibility of scores has been reported to be excellent[<a id="bib16up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib16" id="ref_linkbib16" title="16">16</a>] and in a subgroup of patients in this study, inter‐observer scoring correlated closely. In addition, laboratory values were measured at only one time point. Nevertheless, another study that analysed time averaged phosphate values, reported that these were not significantly associated with VC.[<a id="bib20up&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;"> </a><a data-auto="ep_link" href="&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;#bib20" id="ref_linkbib20" title="20">20</a>] Because these patients were relatively young, BMD values were generally above the osteoporotic range. However, for the combined groups, Z‐scores at the hip were &gt; 1 SD below age adjusted means, and for SPK patients &gt; 1 SD below age adjusted means at the hip and forearm sites, so it remains possible that mineral flux from bone could have impacted VC prevalence. Finally, dialysis vintage may be a surrogate for a variety of exogenous influences (such as calcium exposure and accumulation) and endogenous factors that predispose to VC.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The prevalence of VC amongst younger patients awaiting kidney and SPK transplantation is high, despite lower prevalent CVD than the general dialysis population, and for patients awaiting kidney only transplants, a lower prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. Nevertheless, epidemiological factors predisposing these patients to VC were similar to those reported in studies of older patients on dialysis, with the exception of an inverse relationship of VC to BMD. Of course, this does not exclude altered bone turnover as a potential contributor to VC in younger patients, but does imply that the calcifying process is driven by CKD‐related factors that do not impact on age adjusted bone mineral density.</p><a id="AN0095662745-12"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0095662745-12" title="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The authors thank Tanya Sykes and Abhijit Patekar for their assistance with data collection and Karen Byth for providing statistical advice.</p><a id="AN0095662745-13"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN0095662745-13" title="Disclosures">Disclosures</a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">GJE has acted on the advisory boards of Amgen, Sanofi and Shire Australia.

(English) By: Barreto DV; Barreto FC; Liabeuf S; Temmar M; Boitte F; Choukroun G; Fournier A; Massy ZA, Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN [Clin J Am Soc Nephrol], ISSN: 1555-905X, 2009 Jun; Vol. 4 (6), pp. 1128-35; Publisher: American Society of Nephrology; PMID: 19443628; <br /><strong>Background and Objectives: </strong>Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] &lt;or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk.<br /><strong>Design, Setting, Participants &amp; Measurements: </strong>One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D &lt;or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D &gt;16.7 ng/ml (mean follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.<br /><strong>Conclusions: </strong>Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Persistent link to this record (Permalink): </span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"><a href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19443628&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19443628&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a></span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold">Cut and Paste:</span></strong></dt><dd><span class="medium-normal"> &lt;A href="http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cmedm&amp;AN=19443628&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"&gt;Vitamin D affects survival independently of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.&lt;/A&gt;</span></dd><dt><strong><span class="medium-bold" data-auto="citation_field_label">Database:
