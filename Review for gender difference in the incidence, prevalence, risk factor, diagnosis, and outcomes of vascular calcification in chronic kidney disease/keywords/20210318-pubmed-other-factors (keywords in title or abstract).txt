Chronic kidney disease (CKD) isassociatedwith amineraland 
bonedisorder(CKD-MBD)whichstarts early in the course of the disease and worsens 
with its progression. The main initial serum biochemistry abnormalities are 
increases in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
and decreases in 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) and soluble a-Klotho 
(Klotho), allowing serum calcium and phosphate to stay normal. However, in later 
CKD stages hyperphosphatemia develops in the majority of patients, and serum 25 
hydroxy vitamin D (calcidiol) decreases. Serum calcium may stay normal, 
decrease, or increase. More recent studies suggest that circulating 
Wnt-b-catenin pathway inhibitors such as sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 also play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD.Both the synthesis and the 
secretion of PTH are continuously stimulated, resulting in secondary 
hyperparathyroidism.In addition to the complex effects of the above systemic 
disturbances parathyroid tissue downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 
calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), and Klotho – a local co-receptor of cognate 
fibroblast growth factor receptors of FGF23 – further aggravates the impaired 
control of PTH synthesis and secretion. More recently, miRNAs have been shown to 
also contribute to the stimulation of the parathyroid in the uremic state. The 
chronic stimulation of parathyroid secretory function is not only characterized 
by a progressive rise in serum PTH but also by parathyroid gland hyperplasia. It 
results from an increase in parathyroid cell proliferation which is not fully 
compensated by a concomitant increase in parathyroid cell apoptosis. Parathyroid 
hyperplasia is initially of the diffuse, polyclonal type. In late CKD stages it 
often evolves towards a nodular, monoclonal or multiclonal type of growth. 
Enhanced parathyroid expression of transforming growth factor-a and its 
receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, is involvedin polyclonal 
hyperplasia.Chromosomal changes have been found to be associated with clonal 
outgrowth in some, but notthe majority of benign parathyroid tumors removed from 
patients with end-stage renal disease.In initial CKD stagesskeletal resistance 
to the action of PTH may explain why low bone turnover predominates in a 
significant proportion of patients, together with other conditions inhibiting 
bone turnover such as reduced calcitriol levels, sex hormone deficiency, 
diabetes, and uremic toxins, leading to repression of osteocyte Wnt-b-catenin 
pathway signaling and increased expression of Wntantagonists such as sclerostin 
and Dickkopf-1. High turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa) occurs only later 
on, when serum PTH levels are able to overcome skeletal PTH resistance. The 
diagnosis of secondary uremic hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa relies at 
present mainly on serum biochemistry. X-ray examination of the skeleton is 
useful only in severe forms. It also allows assessment of concomitant vascular 
calcification. From a therapeutic point of view, it is important to prevent the 
development of secondary hyperparathyroidism as early as possible in the course 
of CKD. A variety of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are available, as 
outlined in the final part of the chapter. For complete coverage of all related

Arterial stiffness predicts an increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
Inflammation plays a major role in large arteries stiffening, related to 
atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle cell 
migration, vascular calcification, increased activity of metalloproteinases, 
extracellular matrix degradation, oxidative stress, elastolysis, and degradation 
of collagen. The present paper reviews main mechanisms explaining the crosstalk 
between inflammation and arterial stiffness and the most common inflammatory 
markers associated with increased arterial stiffness, considering the most 
recent clinical and experimental studies. Diverse studies revealed significant 
correlations between the severity of arterial stiffness and inflammatory 
markers, such as white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, adhesion 
molecules, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, cytokines, microRNAs, and 
cyclooxygenase-2, in patients with a broad variety of diseases, such as 
metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial 
disease, malignant and rheumatic disorders, polycystic kidney disease, renal 
transplant, familial Mediterranean fever, and oral infections, and in women with 
preeclampsia or after menopause. There is strong evidence that inflammation 
plays an important and, at least, partly reversible role in the development of 
arterial stiffness, and inflammatory markers may be useful additional tools in 
the assessment of the cardiovascular risk in clinical practice. Combined 
assessment of arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers may improve 
non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular risk, enabling selection of high-risk 
patients for prophylactic treatment or more regular medical examination. 
Development of future destiffening therapies may target pro-inflammatory 
mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is high in patients starting 
dialysis and could be related to modifications of calcification inducers and 
inhibitors by dialysis, promoting cardiovascular events. The impact of dialysis 
initiation on serum calcification propensity evolution and arterial stiffness is 
unknown. We therefore prospectively determined the evolution of the one-half 
maximal transition time (T50) value and its main determinants as well as pulse 
wave velocity over the first 3 months of dialysis initiation.
METHODS: We analysed the evolution of T50, fetuin-A and mineral metabolism 
parameters before dialysis initiation (M0) and monthly until Month 3 (M3) in 
incident patients starting haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) in two 
tertiary Swiss university hospitals. Arterial stiffness was assessed by pulse 
tonometry at M0 and M3 and biological parameters were compared between M0 and M3 
and before/after HD. Linear mixed models were used to assess parameter evolution 
over time, taking into account repeated measures and other influencing 
variables.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients on HD and 12 on PD were followed. Among them, 45 
were male (78%) with a median age of 67 years (25th-75th quartile range 54-77). 
T50 significantly increased between M0 and M3 from 183 (120-266) to 246 min 
(175-330) (P < 0.001). Fetuin-A, calcium and magnesium also increased while 
phosphate decreased. Factors associated with T50 changes over time were 
fetuin-A, phosphate and magnesium (P < 0.001). Fetuin-A changes were associated 
with inflammation-related factors (albumin, C-reactive protein) but not calcium 
and phosphate levels. Arterial stiffness was not significantly modified over 
3 months. PD and HD initiation showed similar trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis initiation significantly improves calcification propensity 
and fetuin-A levels. These modifications do not explain the high mortality 
related to dialysis initiation. The clinical relevance of using T50 values to 
initiate dialysis awaits further studies.

BACKGROUND: The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is central to haemodialysis 
treatment, but up to half of surgically created AVF fail to mature. Chronic 
kidney disease often leads to mineral metabolism disturbances that may interfere 
with AVF maturation through adverse vascular effects. This study tested 
associations between mineral metabolism markers and vein histology at AVF 
creation and unassisted and overall clinical AVF maturation.
METHODS: Concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 23, parathyroid hormone, 
calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolites: 1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D, 25(OH)D, 
and bioavailable 25(OH)D were measured in pre-operative serum samples from 562 
of 602 participants in the Haemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study, a 
multicentre, prospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgical creation 
of an autologous upper extremity AVF. Unassisted and overall AVF maturation were 
ascertained for 540 and 527 participants, respectively, within nine months of 
surgery or four weeks of dialysis initiation. Study personnel obtained vein 
segments adjacent to the portion of the vein used for anastomosis, which were 
processed, embedded, and stained for measurement of neointimal hyperplasia, 
calcification, and collagen deposition in the medial wall.
RESULTS: Participants in this substudy were 71% male, 43% black, and had a mean 
age of 55 years. Failure to achieve AVF maturation without assistance occurred 
in 288 (53%) participants for whom this outcome was determined. In demographic 
and further adjusted models, mineral metabolism markers were not significantly 
associated with vein histology characteristics, unassisted AVF maturation 
failure, or overall maturation failure, other than a biologically unexplained 
association of higher 24,25(OH)2D with overall failure. This exception aside, 
associations were non-significant for continuous and categorical analyses and 
relevant subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of measured mineral metabolites were not 
substantially associated with major histological characteristics of veins in 
patients undergoing AVF creation surgery, or with AVF maturation failure, 
suggesting that efforts to improve AVF maturation rates should increase 
attention to other processes such as vein mechanics, anatomy, and cellular 
metabolism among end stage renal disease patients.

INTRODUCTION: Arterial calcification (AC) is a common complication in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) patients that starts to develop before these patients need 
renal replacement therapy. In these patients, calcification can involve tunica 
intima or tunica media. This study has looked for the prevalence, severity, and 
distribution of arterial wall calcification in incident hemodialysis patients 
through intraoperative arterial biopsy obtained during creation of arteriovenous 
vascular access for hemodialysis.
METHODOLOGY: One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults (98 male and 74 
female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained arterial samples, 
all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline 
phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), 
and 25 hydroxy vitamin D.
RESULTS: Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal 
(subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), while 21 (12%) had both intimal 
and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six patients (50%) were devoid 
of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly higher serum level of 
PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose significant difference 
in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. On the other hand, 
there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, serum PTH, and 
FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification.
CONCLUSION: Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly 
in tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification 
intensity.

INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification and stiffness are associated with higher 
mortality and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients, but the 
underlying mechanism is not well elucidated and previous studies have been 
contradictory. We sought to determine the association of circulating 
calcification biomarkers with calcification, stiffness, and mortality in a 
multiethnic incident dialysis population.
METHODS: Among 391 incident hemodialysis participants enrolled in the Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study, 
we examined the cross-sectional associations of baseline fibroblast growth 
factor 23 (FGF23), desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), 
fetuin-A, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) according to total coronary artery calcium 
score (CAC, using the Agatston calcification criteria) at baseline, vascular 
stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) over 4 study visits, and all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 55 years; 40% were female, 72% were African 
American, and 58% had diabetes. Higher OPG and FGF23 were associated with a 
1.09-fold (per 5-pmol/l increase in OPG; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.01-1.17) and 1.12-fold (per increase of 100 log RU/ml in FGF23; 95% CI: 
1.02‒1.34) higher prevalence of CAC, independent of demographics, comorbidities, 
dialysis factors, and serum klotho levels. Higher OPG was associated with higher 
baseline PWV. Higher FGF23 was associated with lower PWV over follow-up. 
dp-ucMGP and fetuin-A were not associated with either CAC or vascular stiffness. 
After adjustment, circulating biomarkers were not associated with mortality 
risk.
CONCLUSION: Several circulating calcification biomarkers were only modestly 
associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease in an incident multiethnic 
hemodialysis population; none were associated with mortality. Understanding 
whether these associations persist in larger, diverse hemodialysis populations 
is warranted before planning trials.

PURPOSE: Cardiac valve calcification (CVC) is frequently occurred in maintenance 
hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause 
mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between risk factors 
and extent of CVC and further provide the treatment target in MHD patients.
METHODS: One hundred and forty-five patients who received MHD ≥3 months were 
enrolled. CVC was assessed by an echocardiographic, semi-quantitative manner 
called global cardiac calcium scoring system (GCCS), and demographic, clinical, 
and laboratory parameters including mineral metabolism markers were collected.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 50 ± 12 years, and 54.5% were men. 
The mean GCCS was 1.8 ± 2.4; 57.2% of patients had GCCS ≥1. Age, dialysis 
vintage, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and intact parathyroid hormone levels 
were positively correlated with CVC, whereas serum albumin levels were 
negatively related to CVC, based on univariate analysis. With multivariate 
linear regression analysis, serum ALP was the only bone-derived biomarker that 
showed significant correlation with CVC. Serum ALP ≥232 U/L was a robust 
predictor of CVC and was associated with the likelihood of GCCS ≥1 (OR 3.92, 95% 
CI 1.37-11.2, p = 0.011). The decision tree model was used to identify ALP ≥232 
U/L and age ≥60 years as important determinative variables in the prediction of 
CVC in MHD patients.
CONCLUSION: Serum ALP level is significantly associated with CVC in MHD 
patients. ALP is suggested to be a promising interventional target for 
cardiovascular calcification in MHD patients.

AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and has been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular 
events and mortality. This study was to explore the role of Wnt-signaling 
pathway in CKD VC, and the association between VC and blood pressure variability 
(BPV) which is a risk factor of cardiovascular events.
METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into adenine-induced CKD 
group (n = 5), 5/6 nephrectomy CKD group (n = 5), sham group (n = 5) and control 
group (n = 5). Low-calcium-high-phosphate diets were introduced to induce 
vascular calcification. Both daytime (hour-to-hour during the day) and mid-term 
(day-to-day for 9 days) blood pressure (BP) were collected and analyzed for BPV 
metrics. At sacrifice, kidney, heart and aorta samples were taken for 
histological analyses. Calcium deposition in aorta was identified with Alizarin 
Red stain and graded. Immunohistochemistry stain and western blot were performed 
for Wnt3a, Wnt5a, β-catenin, sclerostin, osteopontin, and α-SMA.
RESULTS: Compared with control rats, CKD rats suffered from markedly severer VC 
(Grade 2.6 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.8 vs 0.0 ± 0.0 and 0.2 ± 0.4, P = .0010). VC was 
positively correlated with vascular Wnt3a and β-catenin expression (P = .0032 
and .0000), but not significantly associated with Wnta5a or sclerostin. Besides, 
CKD rats showed increased BPV (P < .001), which was also positively correlated 
with VC.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed that CKD rats had enhanced Wnt-signaling in vascular 
tissue and severer aorta calcification together with increased BPV. Wnt pathway 
may be a potential target in future VC and BPV management in CKD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Klotho is an aging-suppressor gene mainly expressed in the 
renal tubules. The klotho gene encodes the α-klotho protein, which has many 
functions. Previous studies have found that α-klotho protein has a cardiorenal 
protective function. α-Klotho deficiency renders the kidney more susceptible to 
injury and results in cardiovascular calcification and left ventricular 
hypertrophy in chronic kidney disease. However, the role of α-klotho in acute 
heart injury and acute kidney injury with sepsis remains unknown. This study 
aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of α-klotho in septic 
cardiorenal injury.
METHODS: Male 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the control 
group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg) group, LPS (10 mg/kg)+α-klotho (0.01 
mg/kg) group, and LPS (10 mg/kg)+α-klotho (0.02 mg/kg) group. Recombinant 
α-klotho was intraperitoneally injected an hour before LPS injection. Mice were 
euthanized at 24 h after LPS injection. The serum troponin, brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and creatinine 
levels were measured in all groups at 24 h. Biomarkers of mice heart apoptosis, 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as 
caspase-3, interleukin 1 (IL-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), were also measured.
RESULTS: α-Klotho was mainly expressed in mice kidneys and was undetectable in 
the control mice hearts. α-Klotho substantially decreased after LPS injection. 
In the LPS group, the serum troponin levels significantly increased as early as 
6 h (p < 0.05) after LPS injection, while the BNP, NGAL, and creatinine levels 
significantly increased at 24 h (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with α-klotho 
significantly ameliorated acute cardiorenal injury. In the LPS+α-klotho (0.01 
mg/kg) group, the levels of apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress were 
decreased, while the level of endoplasmic reticulum stress was elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: α-Klotho significantly alleviates acute cardiorenal injury in 
LPS-induced septic cardiorenal injury due to the inhibition of apoptosis, 
inflammation, and oxidation, as well as the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum 
stress levels.

BACKGROUND: Aggregation of solid-phase calcium-phosphate and fetuin-A form 
nanoparticles called calciprotein particles (CPP). Serum CPP levels are 
increased in CKD patients and correlated with vascular stiffness and 
calcification. In this study, we evaluated effects of lanthanum carbonate (LC) 
and calcium carbonate (CC) on serum CPP levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: Twenty-four (24) HD patients (50% men, age; 68 ± 12 years, dialysis 
period; 6.2 ± 4.8 years, Kt/v; 1.74 ± 0.34) were treated with CC during 0-8 
weeks and then switched to LC during 9-16 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at 
0, 8, 16 weeks. Serum CPP levels (TCPP) were measured by the gel-filtration 
method. Low-density CPP (LCPP) levels were determined by centrifuging the serum 
samples at 16,000 g for 2 h and measuring CPP levels in the supernatant. The 
difference between TCPP and LCPP was defined as the high-density CPP (HCPP) 
level. We evaluated association of TCPP, LCPP, and HCPP with serum calcium (Ca), 
phosphorus (P), intact PTH, FGF23, Klotho, fetuin-A, aortic calcification index 
(ACI), LDL cholesterol, and hs-CRP.
RESULTS: TCPP and LCPP levels were significantly decreased after switching CC to 
LC, whereas Ca and P levels were not changed. HCPP levels were below the lower 
limit quantification in all patients. The changes in P, Ca × P, LDL cholesterol, 
but not ACI and the changes in hs-CRP, were correlated with the change in TCPP 
levels.
CONCLUSION: The TCPP levels were significantly decreased after switching CC to 
LC. Non-calcium-containing phosphate binders may be preferable for lowering CPP 
levels.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) comorbidity in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, particularly in end‑stage renal disease 
(ESRD). There is an ongoing search for novel biomarkers of CV disease in this 
population.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the associations of matrix proteoglycans 
(PGs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen, and arterial calcifications with 
selected serum and plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and bone turnover in patients with ESRD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 47 adult patients (32 men) with stage 5 CKD. 
The following parameters were investigated: fibrinogen, soluble thrombomodulin 
(sTM), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI‑1), stromal cell‑derived factor 1α 
(SDF‑1α), calcium (Ca), phosphate (Pi), intact parathormone, interleukin 6, 
high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP), ferric reducing ability of plasma, 
2,2‑diphenyl‑1‑picrylhydrazyl scavenging, ferric reducing ability of ascorbate 
in plasma, fetuin‑A, fibroblast growth factor 23, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, 
osteocalcin, transforming growth factor β (TGF‑β), hepatocyte growth factor, 
secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, as well as matrix 
metalloproteinase 2. Radial artery specimens were stained with alizarin red for 
calcifications, alcian blue for PGs and GAGs, and sirius red for collagen.
RESULTS: We observed positive correlations between PG and GAG, collagen, and 
calcification staining. The most intense (grade 3) alcian blue staining was 
significantly correlated with diabetes as well as higher levels of Ca × Pi 
product, hs‑CRP, fibrinogen, SDF‑1α, PAI‑1, and sTM. However, PAI‑1 was the only 
significant predictor of grade 3 alcian blue staining in a multiple logistic 
regression model adjusted for hemodialysis, Ca× Pi product, and hs‑CRP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Coagulation disorders and endothelial dysfunction are the hallmarks 
of ESRD. The levels of SDF‑1α, PAI‑1, sTM, and fibrinogen may be novel 
predictors of early vascular wall alterations and may serve as CV risk markers.

The impact of vascular calcification among dialysis-dependent South African 
patients: A 5-year follow-up study .

Simba K, Borkum M, Strauss N, Basera W, Swanepoel C, Freercks R, Rayner BL.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In 
Western countries, Blacks appear to have lesser degrees of vascular 
calcification compared to non-Blacks. However, there is no published data from 
sub-Saharan Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study assessed the 5-year change in vascular 
calcification and mortality in a previously published cohort of patients with 
ESRD. Vascular calcification was assessed by abdominal aortic calcification 
score and vascular stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV).
RESULTS: 66 of the original 74 participants studied at baseline were identified. 
The median age was 46.6 years (37.6 - 59.2), and 57.6% were women. Abdominal 
aortic calcification showed no progression among Blacks (baseline range 0 - 5, 
follow-up range 0 - 8 (p = 1.00)), but a trend to progression among non-Blacks 
(baseline range 0 - 19, follow up range 0 - 22 (p = 0.066)). Black participants 
did not display a survival advantage (p = 0.870). Non-Blacks had higher 
parathyroidectomy rates than Blacks with 9/30 cases compared to 2/36 
(p = 0.036). After adjustment for parathyroidectomy at follow-up, the odds ratio 
of having abdominal vascular calcification score of ≥ 1 amongst non-Blacks was 
8.6-fold greater compared to Blacks (p = 0.03). A positive correlation (r = 0.5) 
was observed between PWV and abdominal aortic calcification (p = 0.047). 
Elevated baseline coronary artery calcification score and FGF-23 level at 
baseline were not associated with a difference in mortality.
CONCLUSION: There was no significant progression in vascular calcification among 
Blacks. After adjusting for increased parathyroidectomy rates, there was a 
greater progression of vascular calcification amongst non-Blacks compared to 
Blacks.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Uremic cardiomyopathy, 
characterized by myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, has a significant 
contribution to these adverse cardiac outcomes. The protective effect of soluble 
Klotho (s-Klotho) on myocardial damage was demonstrated in in vitro and animal 
experiments. However, data from MHD patients is limited. The present study was 
designed to identify potential correlations between echocardiographic parameters 
and serum s-Klotho levels in MHD patients.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 105 MHD patients from the 
Dialysis Center of Capital Medical University affiliated Beijing Friendship 
Hospital between March and October 2014. The general information for each 
patient was recorded. Fasting blood samples were collected prior to hemodialysis 
during the mid-week session in all patients. The echocardiogram and left lateral 
lumbar spine radiograph were performed after the same mid-week session. The 
dialysis records for each session within 3 months before the blood tests were 
documented. According to the quartiles of s-Klotho levels, patients were divided 
into four groups (Group 1-4). The demographic and clinical characteristics, 
echocardiographic parameters, and abdominal aortic calcification scores among 
the groups were compared.
RESULTS: The enrolled 105 patients were predominantly male (54.3%) with an 
average age of 59.9 ± 11.2 years. Previous hemodialysis durations were 76 
(42-133) months. Sixteen (15.2%) patients had diabetes mellitus. Mean serum 
s-Klotho level was 411.83 ± 152.95 pg/mL, and the 25th percentile, 50th 
percentile, and 75th percentile values of serum s-Klotho levels were 298.9, 412, 
and 498.2 pg/mL, respectively. Individuals in the bottom quartile of s-Klotho 
levels (Group 1) had significantly increased interventricular septal thickness 
(IVST) compared to those in the other three quartiles of s-Klotho levels (Group 
1: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm; vs. Group 2: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm, p = 0.008; vs. Group 3: 0.94 ± 
0.13 cm, p < 0.001; vs. Group 4: 1.03 ± 0.1 5 cm, p = 0.022). There were 
significant differences in the ratios of IVST and posterior wall thickness (PWT) 
between patients of Group 1 and Group 3 (1.12 ± 0.1 2 vs. 1.00 ± 0.1 4, p = 
0.004). No significant differences were found for other parameters among the 
groups. The univariate correlation analyses showed that gender (r = -0.211, p = 
0.030), Kt/V urea (r = -0.240, p = 0.014), hypersensitive C reactive protein 
(hs-CRP) (r = 0.196, p = 0.045), and serum s-Klotho levels (r = -0.260, p = 
0.007) significantly correlated with IVST. Ultimately, only hs-CRP and serum 
s-Klotho levels were entered into a multiple regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that patients with lower circulating 
s-Klotho levels were more often associated with larger IVST and greater ratios 
of IVST and PWT. There was an independent association between s-Klotho and IVST, 
and lower s-Klotho levels seem to be a potential risk factor of uremic 
cardiomyopathy in MHD patients.

Association of serum phosphorus and calcium x phosphate product with mortality 
risk in chronic hemodialysis patients: a national study.

Elevated serum phosphorus is a predictable accompaniment of end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) in the absence of dietary phosphate restriction or supplemental 
phosphate binders. The consequences of hyperphosphatemia include the development 
and progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism and a predisposition to 
metastatic calcification when the product of serum calcium and phosphorus (Ca x 
PO4) is elevated. Both of these conditions may contribute to the substantial 
morbidity and mortality seen in patients with ESRD. We have analyzed the 
distribution of serum phosphorus in two large national, random, cross-sectional 
samples of hemodialysis patients who have been receiving dialysis for at least 1 
year. Data were obtained from two special studies of the United States Renal 
Data System, the Case Mix Adequacy Study (1990) and the Dialysis Morbidity and 
Mortality Study Wave 1 (1993). The relative risk of death by serum phosphorus 
quintiles is described after adjusting for age at onset of ESRD, race, sex, 
smoking status, and the presence of diabetes, the acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome, and/or neoplasm. Logistic regression analysis is then used to describe 
the demographic, comorbid, and laboratory parameters associated with high serum 
phosphorus. Serum phosphorus was similar in these two study populations and 
averaged 6.2 mg/dL. Ten percent of patients had levels greater than 9 mg/dL and 
at least 30% of each group had serum phosphorus levels greater than 7 mg/dL. The 
adjusted relative risk of death by serum phosphorus level was not uniform across 
all quintiles, being constant below a level of 6.5 mg/dL and increasing 
significantly above this level. The relative risk of death for those with a 
serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL was 1.27 relative to those with a serum 
phosphorus of 2.4 to 6.5 mg/dL. This increased risk was not diminished by 
statistical adjustment for coexisting medical conditions, delivered dose of 
dialysis, nutritional parameters, or markers of noncompliance. Evaluation of 
predictors of serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL revealed in multivariate 
analysis that younger age at onset of ESRD, female sex, white race, diabetes, 
active smoking, and higher serum creatinine levels were all significant 
predictors. Analysis of serum calcium revealed no correlation with relative risk 
of death. The Ca x PO4 product, however, showed a mortality risk trend similar 
to that seen with serum phosphorus alone. Those in the highest quintile of the 
Ca x PO4 product (>72 mg2/dL2) had a relative mortality risk of 1.34 relative to 
those with products of 42 to 52 mg2/dL2. The relative mortality risk by log 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was elevated for patients with higher levels, 
but the mortality risk associated with hyperphosphatemia was independent of PTH. 
For hemodialysis patients who have been receiving dialysis for at least 1 year, 
we conclude that a large percentage have a serum phosphorus level above 6.5 
mg/dL and that this places them at increased risk of death. This increased risk 
is independent of PTH. The mechanism(s) responsible for death is unknown, but 
may be related to an abnormally high Ca x PO4 product. Although mechanisms are 
not clearly established, this study supports the need for vigorous control of 
hyperphosphatemia to improve patient survival.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) and is a significant risk factor for future cardiovascular events 
and death. Warfarin use results in dysfunction of matrix Gla protein, an 
inhibitor of vascular calcification. However, the effect of warfarin on vascular 
calcification in patients with ESRD is still not well characterized. Thus we 
investigated whether arterial calcification can be accelerated by warfarin 
treatment both in vitro and in vivo using a mouse remnant kidney model.
METHODS: Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were cultured in medium 
supplemented with warfarin and phosphate to investigate the potential role of 
this drug in osteoblast transdifferentiation. For in vivo study, adult male 
C57BL/6 mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy were treated with active vitamin D3 plus 
warfarin to determine the extent of vascular calcification and parameters of 
cardiovascular function.
RESULTS: We found that the expressions of Runx2 and osteocalcin in HASMC were 
markedly enhanced in the culture medium containing warfarin and high phosphate 
concentration. Warfarin induced calcification of cultured HASMC in the presence 
of high phosphate levels, and this effect is inhibited by vitamin K2. Severe 
aortic calcification and reduced left ventricular ejection fractions were also 
noted in 5/6 nephrectomy mice treated with warfarin and active vitamin D3.
CONCLUSION: Warfarin treatment contributes to the accelerated vascular 
calcification in animal models of advanced chronic kidney disease. Clinicians 
should therefore be aware of the profound risk of warfarin use on vascular 
calcification and cardiac dysfunction in patients with ESRD and atrial 
fibrillation.

Menopause is derived from the Greek words men (month) and pauses (cessation) and 
means permanent cessation of menstruation after the loss of ovarian activity. 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has recently been associated with cardiovascular 
events in several studies. CKD patients have a heavy burden of traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors in addition to a range of nontraditional risk 
factors such as inflammation and abnormal metabolism of calcium and phosphate. 
In this review, the association of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well 
as of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is discussed. CKD mineral and bone 
disorder, characterized by disturbances of calcium/phosphate/parathyroid 
hormone, bone abnormalities and vascular and soft tissue calcification, is 
highly prevalent in CKD and is a strong, independent predictor of bone fracture, 
CVD and death. Estrogen has been shown to: (a) decrease the expression of 
angiotensin type 1 receptors in vasculature and kidneys; (b) reduce the 
expression and activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and (c) cause the 
release of angiotensinogen substrate from the liver. However, the degree of 
activation or suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by 
estrogen has not been clearly established. Clinical data on the effects of 
estrogen therapy on bone mineral densities are extremely limited in the ESRD 
population. CVD is the most common cause of death in postmenopausal women with 
CKD and many contributing factors have been explored. Future research for 
prevention of CVD in postmenopausal women with CKD would focus on the biology of 
vascular calcification as well as bone loss.

AIM: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is associated with 
all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Thus, 
elucidating its pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improving the 
prognosis. We evaluated characteristics of CKD-MBD in a newly developed CKD rat 
model.
METHODS: We used male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and spontaneously diabetic Torii 
(SDT) rats, which are used as models for nonobese type 2 diabetes. CKD was 
induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). At 10 weeks, the rats were classified into six 
groups and administered with a vehicle or a low- or high-dose paricalcitol 
thrice a week. At 20 weeks, the rats were sacrificed; blood and urinary 
biochemical analyses and histological analysis of the aorta were performed.
RESULTS: At 20 weeks, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure, and renal 
function were not significantly different among the six groups. Serum calcium 
and phosphate levels tended to be higher in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. The 
urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate was significantly greater in SDT-Nx 
rats than in SD-Nx rats. After administering paricalcitol, serum parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were significantly 
higher in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. The degree of aortic calcification was 
significantly more severe and the aortic calcium content was significantly 
greater in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that our new CKD rat model using SDT rats represents a 
useful CKD-MBD model, and this model was greatly influenced by paricalcitol 
administration. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanisms 
underlying this model.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage 
renal disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both 
kidney transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular 
calcification. Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by 
vitamin-K-dependent matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney 
transplantation or phosphate binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. 
Therefore, we studied the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate 
binder use on vitamin K status.
METHODS: We measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker 
reflecting low vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on 
hemodialysis (n = 82), peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a 
kidney transplantation (n = 36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate 
binder use. With linear regression, we assessed the influence of kidney 
transplantation and phosphate binder use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, 
adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP 
levels were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 
pmol/L) compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). 
Eighty-nine patients on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate 
binder was not associated with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) 
compared to no phosphate binders (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used 
sevelamer monotherapy, which was associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 
1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist 
use.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP 
levels suggesting improved vitamin K status after transplantation. Sevelamer 
monotherapy is associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of 
vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more attention to vitamin K status in 
patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for protection against vascular 
calcification.

Disease Patient?

BACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a rare and fatal systemic disease which most 
commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is a poorly 
understood vascular calcification with unclear pathology that leads to vascular 
compromise due to vascular occlusion with endoluminal calcification. CASE REPORT 
We report a case of a 61-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who 
developed calciphylaxis. The patient was diagnosed with dry gangrene of the 
second and third digits of the right hand and second, third, and fourth 
phalanges of the left hand. Despite medical therapy and local wound care, the 
lesions progressively worsened with time. The patient was found to have 
secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone was 1028 pg/mL) and underwent 
subtotal parathyroidectomy. In our patient, the skin lesions due to 
calciphylaxis completely resolved over the course of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS 
Parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical benefit in patients with 
calciphylaxis. Clinicians should consider parathyroidectomy in the setting of 
high parathyroid hormone and calciphylaxis. Although parathyroidectomy is an 
effective treatment option for calciphylaxis it is not a definitive treatment 
and calciphylaxis can occur, though rarely, even after parathyroidectomy. There 
is a need to do further studies in order to confirm the efficacy of 
parathyroidectomy.

INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a 
sign of severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. 
Fetuin-A and osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in 
patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD 
therapy. However, there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on 
dialysis. The aim of our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the 
relationship between VC and 25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and 
independent predictors of VC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were 
recruited. Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient 
group was compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A 
plain radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the 
evaluation of VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both 
patients and controls were measured.
RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients were compared 
with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly lower in 
patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly higher 
in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) 
were independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the 
following factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, 
phosphate, PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No 
significant correlation was found between patients with VC and patients without 
VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels.
CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients undergoing HD and is not related 
to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the presence of DM, and high PTH 
levels were independent predictors of VC in patients undergoing HD. Further 
studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying and the factors 
contributing to VC.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality compared to the general population. Hyperphosphataemia, associated 
with vascular calcification and arterial stiffness, may play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with CKD, although 
phosphate reduction strategies have not consistently proven to beneficially 
affect clinically relevant outcomes. The IMpact of Phosphate Reduction On 
Vascular End-points in CKD (IMPROVE-CKD) study is an international, 
multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of 
the phosphate binder lanthanum carbonate on intermediate cardiovascular markers 
in patients with stage 3b-4 CKD. The primary end-point is change in 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, SphygmoCor) after 96 weeks. Secondary 
outcomes include change in abdominal aortic calcification (AAC, computed 
tomography), serum phosphate and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). In total, 
278 participants were recruited and randomized, mean age 63 ± 13 years, 69% 
male, 45% diabetes, 32% CVD, 33% stage 3b CKD and 67% stage 4 CKD. Mean 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate were 26.6 ± 8.3 
mL/min/1.72 m2 and 1.25 ± 0.20 mmol/L, respectively. Median (interquartile 
range) intact and c-terminal FGF-23 levels were 133.0 (89.1-202) pg/mL and 221.1 
(154.3-334.1) RU/mL, respectively. Mean PWV was 10.8 ± 3.6 m/s and 81% had AAC 
(median Agatston score 1,535 [63-5,744] Hounsfield units). PWV ≥10 m/s was 
associated with older age, diabetes, CVD, presence of AAC, higher systolic blood 
pressure (BP), larger waist circumference and higher alkaline phosphatase. AAC 
was associated with older age, male sex, diabetes, CVD, higher diastolic BP, 
dyslipidaemia (and use of statins), smoking, larger waist circumference and 
increased PWV. In conclusion, IMPROVE-CKD participants had high baseline risk 
for cardiovascular events, as suggested by high baseline PWV and AAC values.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is closely related to the 
cardiovascular events in vascular calcification (VC). However, little has known 
about the characteristics of kidney injury caused by VC. Fibroblast growth 
factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine factor, which takes part in various metabolic 
actions with the potential to alleviate metabolic disorder diseases. Even FGF21 
has been regarded as a biomarker in CKD, the role of FGF21 in CKD remains 
unclear. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the FGF21 on the kidney injury in 
VC rats.
METHODS: The male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: (1) 
control group, (2) Vitamin D3 plus nicotine (VDN)-induced VC group, (3) 
FGF21-treated VDN group. After 4 weeks, the rats were killed and the blood was 
collected for serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, calcium, and phosphate 
measurement. Moreover, the renal tissues were homogenized for alkaline 
phosphatases (ALPs) activity and calcium content. The levels of FGF21 protein 
were measured by radioimmunoassay. The levels of β-Klotho and FGF receptor 1 
(FGFR1) protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 
structural damage and calcifications in aortas were stained by Alizarin-red S. 
Moreover, the structure of kidney was observed by hematoxylin and eosin 
staining.
RESULTS: The renal function impairment caused by VDN modeling was ameliorated by 
FGF21 treatment, inhibited the elevated serum creatinine and urea level by 20.5% 
(34.750 ± 4.334 μmol/L vs. 27.630 ± 2.387 μmol/L) and 4.0% (7.038 ± 0.590 mmol/L 
vs. 6.763 ± 0.374 mmol/L; P < 0.01), respectively, together with the structural 
damages of glomerular atrophy and renal interstitial fibrosis. FGF21 treatment 
downregulated the ALP activity, calcium content in the kidney of VC rats by 
42.1% (P < 0.01) and 11.7% (P < 0.05) as well as ameliorated the aortic injury 
and calcification as compared with VDN treatment alone group, indicating an 
ameliorative effect on VC. ELISA assays showed that the expression of β-Klotho, 
a component of FGF21 receptor system, was increased in VDN-treated VC rats by 
37.4% (6.588 ± 0.957 pg/mg vs. 9.054 ± 0.963 pg/mg; P < 0.01), indicating an 
FGF21-resistant state. Moreover, FGF21 treatment downregulated the level of 
β-Klotho in renal tissue by 16.7% (9.054 ± 0.963 pg/mg vs. 7.544 ± 1.362 pg/mg; 
P < 0.05). However, the level of FGFR1, the receptor of FGF21, kept unchanged 
under VDN and VDN plus FGF21 administration (0.191 ± 0.0376 ng/mg vs. 0.189 ± 
0.032 ng/mg vs. 0.181 ± 0.034 ng/mg; P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, FGF21 was observed to ameliorate the kidney 
injury in VDN-induced VC rats. FGF21 might be a potential therapeutic factor in 
CKD by cutting off the vicious circle between VC and kidney injury.

Publisher: 外源性纤维细胞生长因子21对血管钙化大鼠肾脏损伤的保护作用摘要背景： 
在血管钙化中，慢性肾脏病与心血管事件发生密切相关。然而，血管钙化对肾脏损伤的作用知之甚少。FGF21是一种内分泌因子，其在多种代谢过程中发挥作用，并有治疗代谢紊乱性疾病的潜能。尽管FGF21已经被视为一种慢性肾脏病的生物标志物，但其在慢性肾脏病中的作用尚不明确。因此，本实验旨在观察血管钙化对大鼠肾脏结构及功能的损伤情况，以及与肾脏组织局部成纤维细胞生长因子21（Fibroblast 
growth factor 21，FGF21）、β-Klotho及成纤维细胞生长因子受体1（Fibroblast growth factor receptor 
1，FGFR1）表达变化关系；同时探讨外源性给予FGF21对血管钙化大鼠肾脏损伤的影响及可能的机制。 方法： 
雄性SD大鼠按电脑随机数字表法分为正常组（Con）、钙化组（VDN）及钙化+FGF21组（FGF21），每组8只。钙化组采用维生素D3联合尼古丁诱导大鼠血管钙化模型。钙化+FGF21组在钙化组基础上，予大鼠皮下埋入含有FGF21溶液的渗透泵，微量渗透泵持续给药，剂量为70 
ug/kg/d。其余两组大鼠皮下埋入含有等量生理盐水的渗透泵。4周后取动物肾脏组织行碱性磷酸酶及钙含量检测。以肌氨酸氧化酶法检测大鼠血清肌酐浓度，以紫外-谷氨酸脱氢酶法检测大鼠血清尿素氮浓度，以生化法检测大鼠血钙及血磷浓度，以放射免疫法检测大鼠肾脏组织FGF21蛋白含量，以酶联免疫吸附法检测大鼠肾脏组织β-Klotho及FGFR1蛋白含量，以苏木素伊红染色观察肾脏组织结构，以茜素红染色法观察主动脉结构及钙化程度。 
结果：FGF21可改善维生素D加尼古丁诱导的血管钙化导致的肾脏损伤。与单纯血管钙化组相比，其可分别降低20.5%及4% (p < 
0.01)的血肌酐和尿素氮。并可减轻肾小球及肾间质的结构损伤。同时相比于单纯血管钙化组，FGF21可分别降低ALP及钙含量42.1% (p < 
0.01)及11.7% (p < 
0.05)，并能减少主动脉损伤及钙化程度。这些结果表明，FGF21可以减轻血管钙化导致的肾损伤。另外，作为FGF21三聚体的组成部分，ELISA结果显示，β-Klotho在血管钙化大鼠中升高了37.4% 
(p < 0.01),预示机体处于FGF21抵抗状态。而外源性给予FGF21后，大鼠肾脏组织β-Klotho下调16.7% (p < 
0.05)。但是FGF21的受体FGFR1在三种大鼠中无显著性差异(p > 0.05)。 
结论：大剂量维生素D3肌肉注射联合尼古丁灌胃可导致大鼠肾脏组织局部钙超载及微血管钙化形成，并导致肾功能不全，出现早期CKD临床表现。同时病变肾脏组织局部FGF21和β-Klotho表达量上调，而FGFR1在肾脏组织局部未见明显变化。外源性给予FGF21可改善血管钙化情况及肾脏结构与功能，同时下调β-Klotho表达量。FGF21可能通过切断血管钙化与肾脏损伤之间的恶性循环成为治疗血管钙化导致的肾损伤的治疗因子。.

BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular 
calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial 
calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men 
is unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral 
arteries was compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 
patients with radiographs performed during or after warfarin therapy who were 
identified by a computerized search of medical records. Each patient was matched 
to a patient without warfarin exposure based on age, sex, and diabetes status. 
Patients with warfarin exposure <1 month, history of end-stage renal disease, or 
serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were excluded. Radiographs were reviewed visually 
for arterial calcification. The prevalence of arterial calcification was 44% 
greater in patients with versus without warfarin use (30.2% versus 20.9%, 
P=0.0023) but not on radiographs performed before warfarin therapy (26.4% versus 
22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years of warfarin therapy. The increase was noted 
only in the ankle and foot, was limited to a medial pattern of calcification, 
and was similar in men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is associated with lower extremity arterial 
calcification in both men and women independent of age, sex, diabetes status, 
and other patient characteristics. This may have implications for the choice of 
therapies for long-term anticoagulation.

Biochemical markers of bone turnover have been used for decades in the 
management of bone diseases, to assess the prognosis of these conditions and to 
monitor treatments. The new markers, however, also reflect specific 
physiological mechanisms in the bone or other organs. Periostin may be more 
specific to the periosteum; cathepsin K is an osteoclastic enzyme that may be 
involved in the cardiovascular system and joints; Dickkopf-1 is involved in bone 
formation and vascular calcification; sclerostin is a major regulator of bone 
formation in response to mechanical loading and may also play a role in chronic 
kidney disease bone and mineral disorder; sphingosine-1-phosphate is a lipid 
mediator interacting with bone resorption. Some of the bone markers are in fact 
hormones produced by the bone that affect various physiological and pathological 
functions in other organs. Thus, osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts and 
participates in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and fertility in men. 
Fibroblast growth factor 23 is produced by osteocytes to regulate phosphorus and 
1,25(OH)2D3, but it also plays a major role in the adverse consequences of 
declining renal function, in particular with respect to the myocardium. Micro 
RNAs are single-stranded RNAs that regulate several pathways, including the 
development timing, organogenesis, cell apoptosis, proliferation and 
differentiation. Their serum concentration may reflect the links between bone 
physiology and certain conditions in other organs, for example, the 
cardiovascular system.

INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is associated with increased intima- media 
thickness (IMT) and vascular calcification (VC) in maintenance hemodialysis 
(MHD) patients. Fetuin-A is a serum protein, which inhibits vascular 
calcification. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
fetuin-A and VC, in a group of MHD patients.
METHODS: One hundred and forty-three MHD patients were included and followed for 
3 years. Blood samples were studied for calcification and inflammation markers 
and fetuin-A was checked 3 times at the start, middle and the end of the study. 
We used common carotid doppler sonography for assessment of indices of VC, which 
were performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Vascular calcification 
was defined as a common carotid intima media thickness ≥ 0.8 mm on either side 
or the existence of any plaque or stenosis ≥ 50% on either side.
RESULTS: From 143 patients (mean age 57.5 ± 15.9, 60.1% male), 104 patients 
(75.4%) had VC at baseline. The mean age and the prevalence of DM were 
significantly higher in patients with VC (P < .001 for both). There was no 
significant difference in the levels of Pi, PTH, and fetuin-A between the two 
groups. In a multiple logistic regression model at baseline only age (OR = 1.09, 
P < .001), and diabetes mellitus (OR = 4.59, P < .05) were associated with VC 
and dialysis vintage had a marginal association (OR = 1.20, P = .09). At the end 
of the study only age (OR = 1.12, P < .001), and CRP (OR = 1.14, P < .05) were 
associated with VC. The mean survival of patients with VC was significantly 
lower than the patients without VC (31.87 ± 0.95 vs. 33.73 ± 1.29, P < .05), 
however the mortality was not affected by fetuin-A level.
CONCLUSION: Survival rate of patients without VC was higher than the patients 
with VC. We didn't find any correlation between the level of fetuin-A and VC. It 
seems that the traditional risk factors of VC, including age and diabetes 
mellitus are the main predictors of VC in MHD patients.

[Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone 
disorder].

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney 
disease in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone 
disorder (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic 
patients on hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher 
prevalence of severe and progressive vascular calcification with increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main factor which causes vascular 
calcification in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic 
control. The recent trial findings describe an inverse correlation between 
intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels and glycemic control in a group 
of diabetic patients on hemodialysis.
AIM: The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the 
laboratory markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on 
glycemic control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic 
compensation of diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 3rd stage DKD were investigated. 
There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), average age of patients was 
71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l and estimated glomerular 
filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 patients with better 
glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. Patients were 
further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH (iPTH < 35 
pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis was 
performed using and Mann-Whitney test.
RESULTS: We have found the statistical significance in the serum phosphate and 
proteinuria levels in between groups with HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 
%. Diabetics with better glycemic control had significant reduction in serum 
phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p = 0.038) and in 24 hrs 
proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 0.007). In the group of 
presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found the trend towards 
increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, p = 0.063) and 
increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control 
of diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD.

BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death 
from cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may 
play a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC 
prevalence in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism 
(SHPT) and identify CAC risk factors.
METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe hyperparathyroidism 
registration study that prospectively recruited patients on dialysis with severe 
SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 2013 to May 2015. 
CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and clinical data 
including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, 
Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were analyzed. CAC 
scores were reported in Agatston units (AU).
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC 
(<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 
4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin 
were not associated with CAC. In univariate analysis, CAC was significantly 
correlated with age, sex (male), total cholesterol, and intravenous pulse 
calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely correlated with the BMD, T scores, or 
Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In multivariate analysis, the stepwise 
forward multiple linear regression revealed that CAC was associated with age, 
male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). Furthermore, serum 
sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral neck but 
negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum sclerostin 
was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with Z-scores<-2.5 of 
the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid hormone, 
vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of 
vascular calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
dialysis with severe SHPT.

BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor 
virus integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a 
potential contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder 
(MBD), which has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular 
calcification. The positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density 
(BMD) has been demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in 
peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between 
sclerostin and BMD in PD patients.
METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were enrolled; their sera were collected for 
measurement of sclerostin and other CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also 
assessed simultaneously. We examined the relationship between sclerostin and 
each parameter through Spearman correlation analysis and by comparing group data 
between patients with above- and below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and 
multiple logistic regression models were employed to define the most predictive 
of sclerostin levels in the above-median category.
RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that sclerostin was correlated with spine 
BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score (r = 0.274, P = 0.010), spine BMD 
Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH; 
r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. High BMD, old age, 
male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high osteocalcin and uric 
acid levels were observed in patients with high serum sclerostin levels and an 
inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin. Univariate logistic 
regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively correlated with 
above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P = 0.002); the 
correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 121.5, 
P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a positive association 
between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD population.

♦
BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is strongly associated with cardiovascular 
disease and mortality. However, some factors related to vascular calcification 
in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of osteoprotegerin 
(OPG), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF-23), magnesium, and phosphate clearance with vascular calcification in PD 
subjects, assessed by plain radiographs. ♦
METHODS: Simple vascular calcification scores (SVCS) obtained from plain X-rays 
of the pelvis and hands, and the Kauppila Index (KI) from lateral lumbar X-rays 
were assessed in 76 adults receiving PD for ≥ 6 months (43 women, median age 39 
years, median time on PD 1.4 years). Levels of OPG, OPN, OCN, and FGF-23 were 
determined by luminometry. ♦
RESULTS: Serum OPG levels were higher in subjects with vascular calcification (n 
= 22 with SVCS > 3; n = 19 with KI > 7) compared with those with less 
calcification (p < 0.001). Spearman's correlation coefficients between OPG and 
SVCS and KI were r = 0.49 and r = 0.51, respectively (both p < 0.001). Subjects 
with vascular calcification had significantly lower renal phosphate clearance. 
Multiple regression analysis showed that vascular calcification assessed by SVCS 
was associated with age (r = 0.2, p = 0.042), diabetes mellitus (r = 2.4, p < 
0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.09, p = 0.037), and OPG (r = 0.22, p = 
0.001). Vascular calcification assessed by KI was associated with age (r = 0.16, 
p < 0.001), time on PD (r = 0.54, p = 0.001) and OPG (r = 0.08, p = 0.04). 
Osteocalcin, OPN, FGF-23, and magnesium were not associated with vascular 
calcification. ♦
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of OPG were consistently associated with vascular 
calcification in subjects on PD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a regulator of 
phosphorus metabolism, is a risk marker in CKD. FGF-23 has been associated with 
coronary arterial calcification (CAC), but it is not known whether FGF-23 
predicts CAC progression in CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
association of FGF-23 with CAC progression in advanced CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: FGF-23 levels and CAC were 
measured by electrocardiography-triggered multislice computed tomography in 99 
individuals initiating dialysis. Patients were enrolled in the study from April 
2008 to July 2010. CAC was calculated using Agatston and calcium volume score. 
Sixty-seven study participants had repeat CAC measures at 1 year. Linear 
regression was used to assess the association of FGF-23 with CAC.
RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 50 years; 33% were women, and 
64% were black. The median FGF-23 level was 1238 relative units (RU)/ml 
(interquartile range, 515-2218 RU/ml). According to Agatston score, FGF-23 was 
not associated with baseline CAC (P=0.14) but was significantly associated with 
CAC progression. There was a 192.3-Agatston unit change in CAC score per 1-SD 
change in FGF-23 (P=0.008) in models adjusting for known risk factors for CAC 
and serum phosphate. This association persisted after adjustment for 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 25-OH vitamin D levels, and the use of 
phosphorus binders. Results were similar when change in calcium volume score was 
used.
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with advanced CKD, serum FGF-23 is strongly 
associated with CAC progression. FGF-23 may be a marker of cardiovascular risk 
in CKD.

OBJECTIVE: Elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone that 
regulates phosphate homeostasis, has been associated with mortality, 
cardiovascular events, and stroke, and to arterial calcification in chronic 
kidney disease, but its role in atherosclerosis is unclear and population-based 
studies are lacking. We hypothesized that elevated FGF23 would associate with 
carotid plaque presence, area, and echogenicity in the race/ethnically diverse 
community-based Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) sample.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: There were 1512 stroke-free NOMAS participants with FGF23 
and 2-dimensional carotid ultrasound data (mean age, 68±9 years; 61% women; 62% 
Hispanic, 18% black, and 18% white). We used multivariable linear and logistic 
regression to evaluate FGF23, continuously and by quintiles, as a correlate of 
carotid plaque, plaque area (cubic root transformed), and echogenicity adjusting 
for sociodemographic and vascular risk factors. Participants with FGF23 levels 
in the top quintile were more likely to have carotid plaque (odds ratio, 1.49; 
95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.19; P=0.04) and larger plaque area (β=0.32 
mm(2), 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.53 mm(2); P=0.004) than those in the 
lowest quintile, adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
demographics, and vascular risk factors. Linear regression models also showed 
that log transformed FGF23 (LnFGF23) associated with greater odds of plaque 
presence (odds ratio, 1.26 per LnFGF23; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.58; 
P=0.04), and plaque area (β=0.19 mm(2) per LnFGF23; 95% confidence interval, 
0.07-0.31 mm(2); P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher FGF23 associated with greater likelihood and burden of 
carotid atherosclerosis independent of CKD. Atherosclerosis may be a mechanism 
through which FGF23 increases cardiovascular events and stroke.

BACKGROUND: Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases in patients with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and high-turnover bone disease. ALP may represent an 
adjunct marker of high bone turnover devoid of drawbacks of serum parathyroid 
hormone (PTH), and it may also be associated with cardiovascular calcification 
in CKD. Higher ALP has been recently associated with increased mortality and 
coronary calcification in dialysis patients. In pre-dialysis CKD patients, this 
association is not clear.
METHODS: We examined the association of baseline, time-varying and time-averaged 
ALP with all-cause mortality and the composite of pre-dialysis mortality or 
end-stage renal disease in a historical prospective cohort of 1158 male veterans 
with pre-dialysis CKD from a single institution by using multivariable-adjusted 
Cox models.
RESULTS: Higher ALP was associated with increased mortality irrespective of the 
statistical model. Time-averaged ALP displayed a consistent linear association 
with mortality: a 50-U/L higher serum ALP was associated with a 
multivariable-adjusted death hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.17 
(1.08-1.28), P < 0.001. Baseline and time-varying ALP showed non-linear 
associations with mortality, with serum levels above 70 U/L in all models and 
with lower levels in time-varying models. Associations between ALP levels and 
the composite outcomes were similar. However, compared to serum PTH, mortality 
predictability of ALP appeared more incremental.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ALP is associated with increased mortality in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD. Low ALP appears to be associated with short-term 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in 
patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an 
important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was 
conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and 
serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the 
carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated 
tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery 
stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles.
RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial 
stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), 
serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels 
were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
(p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis 
showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, 
p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for 
tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, 
DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum 
OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for 
trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD 
patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in 
the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and 
central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG 
levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial 
stiffening.

This study aimed to establish a rat chronic kidney disease (CKD) model by 
studying the effects of a high-phosphorus diet in rats that had undergone 
partial ligation of the renal arteries (RL). Separate groups of 10-week-old male 
Slc:Sprague-Dawley rats underwent RL and were fed diets with varying phosphorous 
levels for a period of 48 days. A marked suppression of body weight gain 
necessitating humane euthanization occurred on day 28 in rats that had undergone 
RL and were given high-phosphorus feed. By contrast, the group of intact animals 
on a high-phosphorus feed exhibited a slightly decreased body weight gain from 
day 21 and survived until scheduled euthanization. In rats with RL, 
hematological, blood biochemical, and histopathological analyses demonstrated 
the presence of CKD-like conditions, particularly in the group that were fed a 
high-phosphorus diet. Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia were induced by a 
high-phosphorus diet in both the RL and intact groups, both of which had high 
levels of FGF23 and parathyroid hormone in the blood. Rats with RL on a 
high-phosphorus diet showed decreased hematopoiesis by the hematopoietic cell 
area being narrower in the medullary cavity, proliferation of mesenchymal cells 
and osteoblasts/osteoclasts, and expansion of the osteoid area, a furthermore 
generalized vascular lesions, such as calcification, were observed. These 
findings demonstrate that the partial ligation of the renal arteries combined 
with a calcium-phosphorus imbalance induced by a high-phosphorus diet serves as 
an animal model for CKD-like conditions accompanied by bone lesions, helping to 
elucidate this clinical condition and its underlying molecular mechanisms.

Etelcalcetide, a novel peptide agonist of the calcium-sensing receptor, prevents 
vascular calcification in a rat model of renal insufficiency with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism. Vascular calcification occurs frequently in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a consequence of impaired mineral 
homeostasis and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Etelcalcetide 
substantially lowers parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 
(FGF23) levels in SHPT patients on hemodialysis. This study compared the effects 
of etelcalcetide and paricalcitol on vascular calcification in rats with 
adenine-induced CKD and SHPT. Uremia and SHPT were induced in male Wistar rats 
fed a diet supplemented with 0.75% adenine for 4 weeks. Rats were injected with 
vehicle, etelcalcetide, or paricalcitol for 4 weeks from the beginning of 
adenine diet. Rats fed an adenine-free diet were included as nonuremic controls. 
Similar reductions in plasma PTH and parathyroid chief cell proliferation were 
observed in both etelcalcetide- and paricalcitol-treated rats. Serum calcium and 
phosphorus were significantly lower in etelcalcetide-treated uremic rats and was 
unchanged in paricalcitol-treated rats. Both serum FGF23 and aortic calcium 
content were significantly lower in etelcalcetide-treated uremic rats compared 
with either vehicle- or paricalcitol-treated uremic rats. The degree of aortic 
calcium content for etelcalcetide-treated rats was similar to that in nonuremic 
controls and corroborated findings of lack of histologic aortic mineralization 
in those groups. In conclusion, etelcalcetide and paricalcitol similarly 
attenuated progression of SHPT in an adenine rat model of CKD. However, 
etelcalcetide differentially prevented vascular calcification, at least in part, 
due to reductions in serum FGF23, calcium, and phosphorus levels.

BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare but severe complication mostly affecting 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with high 
morbidity and mortality. The natural history, concomitant factors, pathogenesis, 
and treatment for calciphylaxis remain equivocal.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients diagnosed with 
calciphylaxis in a tertiary care center between January 1, 2012, and December 
31, 2017. We describe demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory parameters, 
effectiveness of sodium thiosulfate treatment and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 30 patients (age 65.6 ± 12.79 years, male:female = 8:22), 23 
(76.67%) had ESRD and were either on hemodialysis (15 [65.22%], median duration 
22.5 months [range 0.2-96 months]) or peritoneal dialysis (8 [34.78%], duration 
29±10 months). Predisposing home medications: 8 (28%) had calcium supplements, 
10 (36%) had warfarin, 16 (57%) had vitamin D and 5 (18%) had iron supplements. 
The median parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 239.8 pg/mL (range 4.7-2922). 
Calciphylaxis was found on extremities in 21 (70%) and on torso in 6 (20%) 
patients. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) was given for treatment in 20 (67%) patients 
and 3 were cured in <2.25 months. One-year survival for all patients with 
calciphylaxis was 26% (29% for STS group and 20% for those that did not receive 
STS) and following any surgical treatment regardless of STS use was 14%.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, absence of a control group and low power.
CONCLUSION: Calciphylaxis was more common among females with a predilection for 
extremities over the torso. Elevations in PTH and inflammatory markers were 
common. Treatment with STS did not show a statistically significant improvement 
in survival. Those who were cured, were treated with STS up to three months.

BACKGROUND: A low protein diet (LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue 
supplementation (KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD), while the exact mechanisms of KA's effect are not established yet. We 
have conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of 
LPD + KA and LPD alone in relation to serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels in CKD 
patients.
METHODS: 79 non-diabetic CKD 3b-4 stage patients, compliant with LPD diet 
(0.6 g/kg of body weight/day), had been selected. The patients were randomized 
into two groups. The first group (42 patients) received LPD + КA. The second 
group (37 patients) continued the LРD alone. In addition to routine tests, serum 
Klotho, FGF-23 levels, as well as bioimpedance analysis, sphygmography 
(stiffness (augmentation) indices (AI), central (aortal) blood pressure) with a 
«SphygmaCor» device; echocardiography (valvular calcification score (VCS) and 
LVMMI), were performed.
RESULTS: There were body mass indices' decrease (p = 0.046), including muscle 
body mass in men (p = 0.027) and woman (p = 0.044) in the LPD group to the end 
of study (14th month). In addition, lower FGF-23 (p = 0.029), and higher sKlotho 
(p = 0.037) were detected in the LPD + KA group compared to the LPD one. The 
increase in AI (p = 0.034), VCS (p = 0.048), and LVMMI (p = 0.023) was detected 
more often in the LPD group at the end of study.
CONCLUSION: LPD + KA provides support for nutrition status and contributes to 
more efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities that may result in 
cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD. At the 
same time, a prolonged LPD alone may lead to malnutrition.

INTRODUCTION: Arterial thickening contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk in 
patients on maintenance renal replacement therapy. The common carotid artery 
intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) is an early atherosclerotic marker and may be 
used to assess the stratification of atherosclerotic advancement and resultant 
arterial calcification.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations between 
atherosclerotic changes in the common carotid arteries expressed as the CCA-IMT 
and the body mass index (BMI), serum lipid levels, C‑reactive protein (CRP), and 
selected bone metabolism parameters including phosphorus, calcium, intact 
parathormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, 
osteocalcin, fetuin A, and fibroblast growth factor‑23 (FGF‑23) in patients 
treated with peritoneal dialysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 67 patients with chronic kidney disease 
(36 men and 31 women) aged 53 ±13 years (range, 19-75 years) treated with 
peritoneal dialysis for 30 ±24 months. The CCA‑IMT was assessed by 
ultrasonography using Acuson 128/10 XP. The BMI was calculated using the 
Quetelet formula. Serum lipid levels, phosphorus, calcium, iPTH, alkaline 
phosphatase, and CRP were measured using standard laboratory methods, while 
fetuin A, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, and FGF‑23 using commercial 
enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay kits.
RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed between CCA-IMT and age (r = 0.54, 
P <0.0001), BMI (r = 0.39, P = 0.003), and osteoprotegerin (r = 0.38, P = 
0.004). In a multiple regression analysis, age (r = 0.41, P = 0.01), osteocalcin 
(r = 0.34, P = 0.04), and log‑transformed osteoprotegerin values (r = 0.38, P = 
0.02) remained independently associated with the CCA-IMT. The highest CCA‑IMT 
values (0.85 ±0.21) were observed in patients with osteoprotegerin 
concentrations in the upper tertile. Osteoprotegerin concentrations strongly and 
positively correlated with the duration of dialysis treatment (r = 0.55, P 
<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The CCA‑IMT has been shown to be a reliable noninvasive measure of 
subclinical atherosclerosis and, therefore, of associated increased vascular 
risk. Elevated serum osteoprotegerin levels may be useful as a prognostic marker 
of cardiovascular risk in dialyzed patients.

CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates 
osteoblast activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. 
Recent data indicate that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular 
calcification.
OBJECTIVE: The present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels 
are associated with vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) not yet receiving dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a cross-sectional 
analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was assessed by 
lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to traditional 
and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin levels 
were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
determinants of serum sclerostin and AC.
RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = 
.006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) (P = .0008), lower bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of AC (P = .006) were identified 
as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin levels. In univariate 
logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher body mass index, 
higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower estimated 
glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In multivariate 
analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio [OR] per 
ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history (P = 
.02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
determinants of AC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that patients with 
aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
protects against progression of vascular calcification.

BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent 
by-stander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a 
pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased 
mortality in hemodialysis patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants.
PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality.
RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated 
with older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well 
as higher serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower 
parathyroid hormone levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal 
range in both groups, but the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly 
higher values. In a multivariate time-dependent Cox model using baseline and 
follow-up values of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for 
demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and 
liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly 
associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 - 
1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.57).
LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality 
in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver 
enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in 
hemodialysis patients.

Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in patients with 
atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. In 
blood vessels, VC is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. 
Xanthohumol (XN), a main prenylated chalcone found in hops, has antioxidant 
effects to inhibit VC. This study aimed to investigate whether XN attenuates VC 
through in vivo study. A rat VC model was established by four weeks oral 
administration of vitamin D3 plus nicotine in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In 
brief, 30 male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, 25 
mg/kg nicotine in 5 mL corn oil and 3 × 105 IU/kg vitamin D3 administration 
(VDN), and combination of VDN with 20 mg/L in 0.1% ethanol of XN (treatment 
group). Physiological variables such as body and heart weight and drinking 
consumption were weekly observed, and treatment with XN caused no differences 
among the groups. In comparison with the control group, calcium content and 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were increased in calcified arteries, and XN 
treatment reduced these levels. Dihydroethidium (DHE) and 
2',7'-dichloroflurescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining to identify Superoxide and 
reactive oxygen species generation from aorta tissue showed increased production 
in VDN group compared with the control and treatment groups. Hematoxylin eosin 
(HE) and Alizarin Red S staining were determined to show medial vascular 
thickness and calcification of vessel wall. Administration of VDN resulted in 
VC, and XN treatment showed improvement in vascular structure. Moreover, 
overexpression of osteogenic transcription factors bone morphogenetic protein 2 
(BMP-2) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) were significantly 
suppressed by XN treatment in VC. Moreover, downregulation of vascular 
phenotypic markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and smooth muscle 22 alpha 
(SM22α) were increased by XN treatment in VC. Furthermore, XN treatment in VC 
upregulated nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) 
and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions. Otherwise, Kelch-like ECH-associated 
protein 1 (Keap1) was alleviated by XN treatment in VC. In conclusion, our 
findings suggested that XN enhances antioxidant capacity to improve VC by 
regulating the Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 pathway. Therefore, XN may have potential effects 
to decrease cardiovascular risk by reducing VC.

BACKGROUND: There are some uncertainties among the risk factors of vascular 
calcification in the hemodialysis patients. This study was planned to examine 
the association between abdominal aortic calcification and concerned biochemical 
parameters in hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: In this cross- sectional study, 84 stable hemodialysis patients 
admitted on hemodialysis section of Shahid Beheshti Hospital in 2013 were 
enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Pre-dialysis venous blood samples 
were taken from patients to determine the amount of intact parathyroid hormone 
(iPTH), alkaline phosphatase (Alk.P), C - reactive protein (CRP), calcium (Ca) 
and phosphorus (P). Patients underwent abdominal CT scanning and ACI (ACI) was 
calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. 
Chi-square, Kruskal Wallis and One Way ANOVA tests were used. P-values < 0.05 
were considered significant.
RESULTS: The average age of participants was 50.15±17.03 years (18-83 y/o).A 
statistically significant correlation was observed between ACI and ALK-P serum 
levels (p=0.01). It was found that ACI had a significant relationship with 
phosphorus in women (p=0.01). ALK-P serum levels in men also had a significant 
relationship with ACI (p=0.02). In addition, there was a significant correlation 
between ACI and history of cerebro-cardiovascular disease and also duration of 
dialysis (p=0.004 and 0.0001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with longer duration of dialysis, and patients with a 
history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, ACI levels were 
significantly higher. ALK-P and phosphorus were correlated with aortic 
calcification in males and females respectively. No significant correlation was 
found between iPTH serum levels and aortic calcification.

BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare 
and often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is characterized by 
painful skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification and intimal 
proliferation of small arteries. Studies in western countries have reported 
incidences ranging from 1 to 4% in chronic hemodialysis patients. Since no 
systematic studies of calciphylaxis have ever been performed in Japan, we 
conducted a nationwide survey and a case-control study to identify the 
characteristics of calciphylaxis in the Japanese dialysis population.
METHODS: Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760 hemodialysis centers in Japan, 
asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been encountered in the past, and 
detailed clinical data regarding each case were then collected from the centers. 
In addition, two control dialysis patients matched for age and duration of 
hemodialysis to each calciphylaxis case were identified at the participating 
centers, and their data were analyzed to identify risk factors for 
calciphylaxis.
RESULTS: Responses to the questionnaire were obtained from 1838 centers (48.3%), 
and 151 centers reported that a total of 249 cases had been encountered. 
Sixty-four centers agreed to participate in the case-control study, and detailed 
clinical data in regard to 67 cases were obtained. In 28 of the 67 cases, a 
definite diagnosis of calciphylaxis was made by our study group based on the 
clinical characteristics and skin biopsy findings. A univariate logistic 
regression model comparing them with 56-matched controls identified warfarin 
therapy [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI)] 2.7-48.1, 
P=0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR 19.8, 95% CI 4.4-89.5, 
P=0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma glucose level (OR 3.74, 95% CI 
1.08-12.9, P=0.037) and each 1 mg/dL increment in adjusted serum calcium level 
(OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.63-6.30, P=0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly 
associated with calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with 
female gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted 
calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin therapy 
and lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk factors after a 
multivariate logistic regression model analysis.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that warfarin therapy and lower 
serum albumin levels are significant and strong risk factors for the development 
of calciphylaxis in chronic hemodialysis patients in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on 
prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic 
calcification progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification 
progression in patients on HD.
METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. Of 
those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular 
blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic 
calcification index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. 
Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index 
(GNRI). A normalized treatment ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated 
by Kt/V. The difference in ACI values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a 
ΔACI, and patients were stratified into two groups according to ΔACI value: high 
(≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). 
Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and 
GNRI were compared between ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors 
independently associated with a higher ΔACI progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) 
were determined using multivariate logistic analysis.
RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, 
respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression 
for 1 year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, 
respectively. The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 
128 (70%) and 56 (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, 
presence of diabetic nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, 
C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis revealed that independent factors associated with a 
higher ΔACI progression were male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and 
GNRI of < 90.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent 
risk factor for the progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management 
may have the potential to improve progression of aortic calcification in 
patients on HD.

Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) detected on lateral vertebral fracture 
assessment is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin D 
deficiency and toxicity have been linked with vascular calcification. The 
objective of this study was to determine the effect of high-dose vitamin D on 
the progression of AAC. The Physical Performance, Osteoporosis and vitamin D in 
African American Women (PODA) is a randomized, clinical trial examining the 
effect of vitamin D. There were 14.7% subjects with AAC in the vitamin D group, 
compared to 12.1% in the placebo group at baseline. The prevalence of extended 
AAC at baseline was 6.4% in the vitamin D group and 3.5% in the placebo group. 
The extended calcification scores over time were not different between groups. 
There was no association between AAC and serum 25(OH)D. However, PTH was 
associated with an increase in AAC in the placebo group.

Pulse pressure (PP) reflects increased large artery stiffness, which is caused, 
in part, by arterial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. PP 
has been shown to predict both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in 
various patient populations, including kidney transplant (KTX) recipients. 
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a marker and regulator of arterial calcification, and 
it is related to cardiovascular survival in hemodialysis patients. Here we 
tested the hypothesis that OPG is associated with increased pulse pressure. We 
cross-sectionally analyzed the association between serum OPG and PP in a 
prevalent cohort of 969 KTX patients (mean age: 51 +/- --13 years, 57% male, 21% 
diabetics, mean eGFR 51 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m2). Independent associations were 
tested in a linear regression model adjusted for multiple covariables. PP was 
positively correlated with serum OPG (rho = 0.284, p < 0.001). Additionally, a 
positive correlation was seen between PP versus age (r = 0.358, p < 0.001), the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (r = 0.232, p < 0.001), serum glucose (r = 0.172, p < 
0.001), BMI (r = 0.133, p = 0.001) and serum cholesterol (r = 0.094, p = 0.003). 
PP was negatively correlated with serum Ca, albumin and eGFR. The association 
between PP and OPG remained significant after adjusting for multiple potentially 
relevant covariables (beta = 0.143, p < 0.001). We conclude that serum OPG is 
independently associated with pulse pressure in kidney transplant recipients.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification 
inhibitors such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, 
vitamin K insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are 
unclear.
STUDY DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean 
age, 51±12 (SD) years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney 
transplantation.
FACTOR: Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, 
reflecting vitamin K status.
OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant failure.
RESULTS: At inclusion, median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, 
with 473 (91%) patients having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as 
dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 
(29%) patients died and 54 (10%) developed transplant failure. Patients in the 
highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at considerably higher mortality risk compared 
with patients in the lowest quartile (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for 
trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). After adjustment for potential 
confounders, including kidney function and exclusion of patients treated with a 
vitamin K antagonist, this association remained significant. Patients in the 
highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing transplant failure (HR, 
2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.01), but this 
association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney function (HR, 1.20; 
95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7).
LIMITATIONS: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. 
No data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of 
dp-ucMGP, is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is 
associated independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should 
address whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after 
kidney transplantation.

Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious 
problem in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and 
vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels 
to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in 
vitro was examined. HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels 
of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured 
in media containing phosphate levels comparable with those seen in 
hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 mM) showed dose-dependent increases in 
mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies showed that elevated phosphate treatment 
of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers 
osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMC were 
mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the 
ability of the specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently 
inhibit phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 
gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel 
type III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate 
HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offers a 
novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined the factors affecting 
peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. 
There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular calcification. In multivariate 
logistic regression, the significant factors affecting vascular calcification 
were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, increased phosphate 
concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. Our 
findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly stimulate HSMC to 
undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offer a novel 
explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic 
conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Matrix gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of medial 
arterial calcification whose synthesis and activity are blocked by warfarin. 
Warfarin induces arterial calcification in experimental models, but whether this 
occurs in humans is unclear. This was addressed by examining breast arterial 
calcification, which is exclusively medial and easily identified on mammograms.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Screening mammograms from women with current, past, or 
future warfarin use were examined for the presence of arterial calcification and 
compared with mammograms obtained in untreated women matched for age and 
diabetes mellitus. Women with a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or a history of 
end-stage renal disease were excluded. In 451 women with mammograms performed 
after ≥1 month of warfarin therapy, the prevalence of arterial calcification was 
50% greater than in 451 untreated women (39.0% versus 25.9%; P<0.0001). However, 
in 159 mammograms performed before warfarin therapy, the prevalence of arterial 
calcification was not increased (26.4% versus 25.8%). The increased prevalence 
varied with duration of treatment, from 25.0% for <1 year to 74.4% for >5 years. 
In a multivariable logistic model, only age and duration of warfarin, but not 
the period of time after stopping warfarin, were significant determinants of 
arterial calcification in women with current or past warfarin use.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of breast arterial calcification is increased in 
women with current or past warfarin use independent of other risk factors and 
conditions predating warfarin use. This effect appears to be cumulative and may 
be irreversible.

BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a serum protein that inhibits ectopic vascular 
calcification and is present in lower concentrations in end-stage renal disease 
than in healthy controls. Whether fetuin-A concentrations are also lower in the 
setting of mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.
METHODS: We evaluated the associations of several parameters of kidney function 
including measured 24 h urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl), estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the Mayo Clinic quadratic GFR equation 
(qGFR), serum cystatin-C concentrations, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
with serum fetuin-A concentrations in 970 outpatients with coronary artery 
disease. We used general linear models to determine the adjusted mean fetuin-A 
concentrations within each kidney function category.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study sample was 67 years, 82% were male, 71% had 
hypertension and 26% had diabetes mellitus. In adjusted analysis, we observed no 
significant differences in mean fetuin-A concentrations across groups defined by 
CrCl, qGFR, or albumin-to-creatinine ratio groups. For example, adjusted mean 
fetuin-A concentrations were 0.66 g/l in participants with CrCl > 90, 60-90 and 
45-60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and 0.65 g/l in participants with CrCl < 45 ml/min/1.73 
m(2). Higher serum cystatin-C (indicating worse kidney function) was associated 
with higher adjusted mean serum fetuin-A concentrations (lowest quartile 0.62 
g/l, highest quartile 0.68 g/l; P for trend <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among ambulatory patients with coronary artery disease, there is no 
evidence that mild-to-moderate CKD is associated with lower concentrations of 
serum fetuin-A compared with persons with normal renal function. The mechanisms 
explaining the association between CKD and vascular calcification remain 
elusive.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with arterial medial 
calcification which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
disease in this population. Several factors are known to promote soft tissue and 
accelerated arterial calcification in CKD including systemic inflammation, 
altered calcium and phosphate homeostasis, hypertension, and deficiency of 
endogenous calcification inhibitors. The ABCC6 transporter (ATP-binding cassette 
subfamily C number 6), also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 
(MRP6), is highly expressed in the liver and kidney. Mutation of ABCC6 results 
in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an inherited disorder characterized by arterial and 
soft tissue calcification. Given the prevalence of arterial medial calcification 
in CKD, the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that CKD may 
lead to acquired ABCC6 deficiency.
METHODS: CKD was induced via 5/6 nephrectomy in male Sprague-Dawley rats and by 
adenine-containing diet to cause chronic interstitial nephropathy in female 
DBA/2J mice. Sham-operated rats and mice fed regular diet served as controls. 
Liver and kidney tissues were harvested and processed for ABCC6 protein and mRNA 
analysis.
RESULTS: ABCC6 protein levels were significantly reduced in the liver and kidney 
tissues from CKD rats and mice. However, ABCC6 mRNA levels were unchanged, 
pointing to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms for the 
observed ABCC6 deficiency. Additionally, plasma levels of the calcification 
inhibitor fetuin-A were significantly decreased in CKD animals compared to 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: CKD results in acquired ABCC6 transporter deficiency. To our 
knowledge this abnormality has not been previously reported and may contribute 
to CKD-associated vascular and soft tissue calcification.

The pathophysiology of medial arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) is unclear but has been ascribed to phenotypic changes in vascular smooth 
muscle, possibly in conjunction with intimal proliferation and atherosclerosis. 
As the prevalence of calcification in breast arteries is increased in women with 
CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), this was examined histologically in 
mastectomy specimens from 19 women with CKD or ESRD. Arterial calcification was 
present in 18, was exclusively medial, and occurred in vessels as small as 
arterioles. Intimal thickening was common but unrelated to calcification. There 
was no evidence of atherosclerosis. The earliest calcification presented as 
small punctate lesions scattered throughout the media, often with calcification 
of the internal elastic lamina. Arterial calcification was present in all 
samples from an age- and diabetes-matched cohort without CKD but was much 
milder. While smooth muscle cell density was reduced one-third in arteries from 
patients with ESRD, the cells appeared normal, expressed SM22α, and exhibited no 
apoptosis. Staining for the bone-specific protein osteocalcin, the osteoblastic 
transcription factors Runx2 or osterix, or the chondrocytic transcription factor 
SOX9 was absent in regions of early calcification. Thus, medial calcification in 
breast arteries of patients with CKD can occur in the absence of smooth muscle 
cell apoptosis and/or osteogenic transdifferentiation. This suggests that the 
pathologic mineralization process may differ from one arterial type to the 
other.

Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in 
vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery 
intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque 
identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and 
monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated 
FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in 
maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma 
FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and 
CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred 
twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 
years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice a week) 
were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing tertiles of plasma 
FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, P<0.0001). Log 
plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free of 
plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was 
recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple 
regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant 
independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to 
clarify whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential 
mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a recently identified 
circulating factor that regulates phosphate (Pi) metabolism. Since the 
derangement of Pi control is an important risk factor for vascular 
calcification, we investigated the importance of plasma FGF-23 in the 
development of vascular calcification in the aorta and peripheral artery in 
hemodialysis patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: Male hemodialysis patients with DM (n=32) and without DM (n=56) were 
examined. Plasma samples were obtained before the start of dialysis sessions, 
and the FGF-23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Roentgenography of the aorta and hand artery was performed, and visible vascular 
calcification was evaluated by one examiner, who was blinded to the patient 
characteristics.
RESULTS: In the 56 non-DM hemodialysis patients, vascular calcification was 
found in the hand artery in 5 patients (8.9%) and in the aorta in 23 patients 
(41.1%). These levels were significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the 32 DM 
patients, of whom, 19 (59.4%) and 21 (65.6%) had vascular calcification of the 
hand artery and aorta, respectively. Multiple regression analyses performed 
separately in the non-DM and DM patients showed that the plasma FGF-23 level, 
CaxPi product, and body weight are independent factors significantly associated 
with hand-artery calcification and that diastolic blood pressure is associated 
with aorta calcification in non-DM patients. In DM patients, the plasma FGF-23 
level and hemodialysis duration emerged as independent factors associated with 
hand-artery calcification and diastolic blood pressure was associated with aorta 
calcification. The independent association of the plasma FGF-23 level with 
hand-artery calcification was retained in both non-DM and DM patients when 
adjusted for the CaxPi product.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the plasma FGF-23 level is an independent 
factor negatively associated with peripheral vascular calcification in the hand 
artery, but not in the aorta, in both male non-DM and DM hemodialysis patients, 
even when adjusted for the CaxPi product. This study raises the possibility that 
the plasma FGF-23 level may provide a reliable marker for Moenckeberg's medial 
calcification in male hemodialysis patients, independent of its regulatory 
effect on Pi metabolism.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a predictor of poor survival 
and cardiovascular outcome in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; however, 
there is scarce information of VC in Latin America, and virtually no data in our 
setting. We undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics 
of VC in a hemodialysis (HD) population from western Mexico and to determine 
possible associated factors.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed in 52 patients. VC was 
evaluated using plain X-ray films (Adragao's score) of hands and pelvis; 
clinical and biochemical variables were also collected. Statistical analysis was 
carried out with Student t and χ(2) tests performed as appropriate and logistic 
regression to determine predictors of VC.
RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years, 48% were female, 23% had diabetes mellitus (DM), 
and median time on dialysis was 46 months. Percentage prevalence was 52% with a 
mean calcification score of 2.0 ± 2.6; 23% of patients had severe calcification. 
VC was present in about 23-37% among the different vascular territories 
evaluated (radial, digital, femoral and iliac). Patients with calcification were 
significantly older, had a higher frequency of DM, higher alkaline phosphatase 
and lower HDL lipoproteins than those without VC. In the multivariate analysis, 
VC in these patients was significantly predicted only by an older age (OR [95% 
CI]: 1.15 [1.01-1.31], p = 0.04); lower HDL-cholesterol and higher alkaline 
phosphatase were marginal predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Half of our HD patients had VC. Territories of radial, iliac, 
femoral and digital arteries were roughly equally affected, and 25% of patients 
had a calcification considered as severe. Older age was the only significant 
predicting variable for VC, with low HDL-cholesterol and high alkaline 
phosphatase as marginal predictors.

Vitamin K antagonism aggravates chronic kidney disease-induced neointimal 
hyperplasia and calcification in arterialized veins: role of vitamin K 
treatment?

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the common vascular access type for a 
hemodialysis patient. Its failure is due to neointimal hyperplasia. Vitamin K 
antagonists are given to lower thrombosis tendency, but have side effects that 
enhance arterial calcifications. Here, we investigated the effects of vitamin K 
antagonists and vitamin K2 (K2) treatment on neointimal hyperplasia development 
and calcification in rats and in arterialized human veins. AVF was generated in 
female rats while chronic kidney disease (CKD) was induced using an 
adenine-enriched diet. Arterialization, CKD, and vitamin K antagonists all 
significantly enhanced venous neointimal hyperplasia. K2 treatment, additional 
to vitamin K antagonists, significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia in 
arterialized veins in healthy rats but not in rats with CKD. Arterialization, 
CKD, and vitamin K antagonism all significantly increased, whereas K2 
supplementation attenuated calcification in healthy rats and rats with CKD. K2 
significantly enhanced matrix Gla protein carboxylation in control rats and rats 
with CKD. Arterialized human vein samples contained inactive matrix Gla protein 
at calcification and neointimal hyperplasia sites, indicating local vitamin K 
deficiency. Thus, vitamin K antagonists have detrimental effects on AVF 
remodeling, whereas K2 reduced neointimal hyperplasia and calcification 
indicating vasoprotective effects. Hence, K2 administration may be useful to 
prevent neointimal hyperplasia and calcification in arterialized veins

BACKGROUND: Premature vascular calcification (or rather ossification) 
significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic 
kidney disease stage 5 (CKD-5) and is linked to dysregulation of bone 
remodelling proteins. Recent evidence of a cross-talk between bone and fat 
tissue urged us to investigate whether the calcification/ossification-associated 
factors osteoprotegerin (OPG) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) are expressed 
in human uremic subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and if the expression differs 
from nonuremic SAT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal SAT biopsies were obtained from 38 patients 
with CKD-5 [16 women, 58 (22-73) years old] during the surgical insertion of a 
peritoneal dialysis catheter and 20 controls [11 females, 56 (40-77) years old] 
undergoing elective hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantifications were performed followed by 
immunohistochemical staining and serum protein concentration measurements. 
Relative mRNA expression and protein concentrations were evaluated together with 
clinical parameters. An additional 59 patients with CKD-5 were included for 
replication of statistical analyses.
RESULTS: OPG but not AHSG mRNAs were detected in SAT, which were also positively 
immunolabelled for OPG. OPG mRNA levels were reduced (P = ·0001) and serum OPG 
concentrations were elevated (P < 0·0001), both about twofold, in patients 
compared to controls. Circulating OPG increased in proportion to BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Human SAT expresses OPG but not AHSG, and OPG expression is reduced 
in patients with CKD-5 when compared to controls, despite increased circulating 
protein levels.

AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis 
(HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship 
between the progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF)-23.
METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD patients. 
Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a score 
(AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination.
RESULTS: The percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser 
than in regressors (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis 
duration in regressors (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors 
(19.5±7.0 years) and progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum 
FGF-23 level in regressors (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than 
in non-progressors (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 
pg/mL). Multi-ple regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, 
F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) 
and log FGF-23 (β value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent 
determinants of ΔAoACS.
CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between inflammatory mediators, mitral 
annular calcification (MAC), and osteocalcin in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echocardiographic data for 60 patients diagnosed as CKD 
were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into 2 groups; 
patients with MAC (MAC+ group) and patients without MAC (MAC- group). The 
relationships between biochemical markers-including osteocalcin-and MAC were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The study included 19 female and 41 male patients. In all, 29 patients 
were MAC+ and 31 were MAC-. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and 
osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the MAC+ group (p < 0.05). The 
eGFR was lower, serum calcitonin (we could not obtain calcitonin data for 15 
patients), Ca, PO4, CaxPO4, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red cell 
distribution width, the neutrophil/Lymphocyte rate, and PTH were higher in the 
MAC+ group; however, the differences between the groups were not significant 
(p > 0.05). The mitral E/A ratio, mitral peak Ea velocity, tricuspid E/A ratio, 
hsCRP, and the osteocalcin level were strongly correlated with MAC. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that only the osteocalcin level and mitral 
E/A ratio were independent variables, each with an independent effect on MAC.
CONCLUSION: CKD patients in the MAC+ group had higher osteocalcin levels than 
those in the MAC- group, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was more 
common in the MAC+ group.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in dialysis (HD) 
patients, and its mechanism is multifactorial. Most likely that systemic or 
local inhibitory factor is overwhelmed by promoters of VC in these patients. VC 
increased arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the 
present study aimed to investigate the association of VC and myocardial 
remodeling and to analyze their relationship with VC promoters (fibroblast 
growth factor 23-FGF23, Klotho, intact parathormon-iPTH, vitamin D) in 56 
prevalent HD patients (median values: age 54 yrs, HD vintage 82 months).
METHODS: Besides routine laboratory analyzes, serum levels of FGF 23, soluble 
Klotho, iPTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; pulse wave velocity (PWV); left 
ventricular (LV) mass by ultrasound; and VCs score by Adragao method were 
measured.
RESULTS: VC was found in 60% and LV concentric or eccentric hypertrophy in 50% 
patients. Dialysis vintage (OR 1.025, 95%CI 1.007-1.044, p=0.006) FGF23 (OR 
1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.012, p=0.029) and serum magnesium (OR 0.000, 95%CI 
0.000-0.214, p=0.04) were associated with VC. Changes in myocardial geometry was 
associated with male sex (beta=-0.273, 95% CI -23.967 1.513, p=0.027), iPTH 
(beta 0.029, 95%CI -0.059-0.001, p=0.027) and vitamin D treatment (beta 25.49, 
95%CI 11.325-39.667, p=0.001). Also, patients with the more widespread VC had 
the highest LV remodeling categories. PWV was associated patient's age, 
cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, LV mass (positively) and serum calcium 
(negatively), indicating potential link with atherosclerotic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite to different risk factors for VC and myocardial remodeling, 
obtained results could indicate that risk factors intertwine in long-term 
treatment of HD patients and therefore careful and continuous correction of 
mineral metabolism disorders is undoubtedly of the utmost importance.

mehanizmima. Postoji mišljenje da promoteri VC prevazilaze lokalni ili sistemski 
uticajinhibitora VC kod ovih bolesnika. VC povećavaju krutost krvnih sudova i 
izazivaju hipertrofiju leve komore (LVH). Ova studija je imala za ciljeve da 
ispita povezanost VC i remodelinga srčanog mišića i da analizira ulogu promotera 
VC (fibroblast growth factor 23-FGF23, Klotho, intakt parathormon-iPTH, vitamin 
D) kod 56 prevalentnih HD bolesnika (medijana: starost 54 godine, HD trajanje 82 
meseca).
METODE: Pored rutinskih laboratorijskih analiza, izmereni su FGF 23, Klotho, 
iPTH, 1,25-dihidroksi vitamin D; brzina pulsnog talasa (PWV); LVH pomoću 
sonografije; a skor VC je određen Adragao metodom.
REZULTATI: VC su nađene kod 60% a koncentrična i ekscentrična LVH kod 50% 
bolesnika. Trajanje HD (OR 1,025, p=0,006), FGF23 (OR 1,006, p=0,029) i 
S-magnezijum (OR 0.000, p=0,04) bili su udruženi sa VC. Promene u geometriji 
miokarda su bile udružene sa muškim polom (beta=-0,273, p=0,027), iPTH (beta 
0,029, p=0,027) i lečenjem sa vitaminom D (beta 25,49, p=0,001). Bolesnici sa 
većim VC skorom imali su najviše kategorije LVH. PWV je bila udružena sa 
starosti bolesnika, koncentracijom holesterola, dijastolnim krvnim pritiskom i 
LVH (pozitivno) i S-kalcijumom (negativno).
ZAKLJUČAK: Iako su različiti faktori rizika za VC i promene u geometriji 
miokarda, dobijeni rezultati bi mogli da ukažu na međusobno preplitanje 
ispitanih faktora kod bolesnika lečenih hemodijalizom. Zbog toga se savetuje 
pažljiva i stalna korekcija poremećaja u metabolizmu minerala.

BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and 
easily detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to 
investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone 
metabolism parameters in dialysis patients.
METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30 men, 33 women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 
years) who were on dialysis therapy for more than 6 months. Forty-four patients 
were on peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients were on hemodialysis therapy. The 
same observer evaluated the presence of CCC by using a slit-lamp microscope, and 
a total CCC score was recorded for each patient. Fifty-two age- and sex-matched 
healthy controls also were evaluated by using the same method. Biochemical data 
were collected from patient files. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar 
spine and femoral neck was measured, and the presence of vascular calcification 
was assessed by using x-ray examinations of the pelvis and hands.
RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly higher than that in 
controls (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC score correlated 
significantly with duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s = 0.392; P = 
0.002), serum phosphorus level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium x 
phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 0.007). However, we did not find a 
significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, 
albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The frequency of vascular 
calcification was significantly greater in patients with a high CCC score (CCC 
score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% versus 5.6%; P = 
0.002).
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and noninvasive method. It 
seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to assess the status of 
extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

Medial arterial calcification (MAC) and renal osteodystrophy are complications 
of mineral bone disease (MBD) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our 
aim was to develop a novel mouse model to investigate the clinical course of 
CKD-MBD. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were assigned to the following 
groups: the control group, fed a standard chow for 6 or 12 weeks; the CKD-normal 
phosphorus (NP) group, fed a chow containing 0.2% adenine, with normal (0.8%) 
phosphorus, for 6 or 12 weeks; and the CKD-high phosphorus (HP) group, fed 6 
weeks with the 0.2% adenine/0.8% phosphorus diet, followed by a chow with 1.8% 
phosphorus for 2 weeks, 4 weeks or 6 weeks. Serum phosphorus was significantly 
increased in the CKD-HP group, and associated with MAC formation; the volume of 
calcification increased with longer exposure to the high phosphorus feed. MAC 
was associated with upregulated expression of runt-related transcription factor 
2, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin, indicative of osteoblastic 
trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. A significant mineral 
density depletion of cortical bone was observed. We describe the feasibility of 
developing a model of CKD-MBD and provide findings of a direct association 
between elevated serum phosphorus and the formation of MAC and renal 
osteodystrophy.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the echocardiographic 
characteristics of chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) in a multicenter prospective cohort 
study.Methods and Results:Three hundred and fifteen patients with ESRD 
(67.9±10.6 years, 47.6% male) on chronic HD for ≥1 year were examined on 
transthoracic echocardiography, including Doppler-derived aortic valve area 
(AVA) measurement. Only 11.5% and 3.4% of all patients had normal left 
ventricular (LV) geometry and normal LV filling pattern, respectively. The 
majority of patients had aortic and mitral valvular calcification, and 
approximately 50% of all 315 patients had aortic valve narrowing with AVA <2.0 
cm2. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to AVA index tertile: group 
1, highest tertile; group 2, middle tertile; and group 3, lowest tertile. Group 
3 was older, had a greater cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray, higher plasma 
brain natriuretic peptide and total LV afterload, and lower stroke volume index 
than the other 2 groups. Age and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level were 
independently associated with low AVA index.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESRD on chronic HD have a high prevalence of cardiac 
structural and functional abnormalities including calcified aortic sclerosis. 
High age and PTH were associated with aortic valve narrowing in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients suffer from a high burden of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Partly this is due to progressive deterioration of 
calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Previous studies suggested that besides FGF-23, 
low levels of Klotho, a protein linked to aging, might constitute a key factor 
in this detrimental relationship. The purpose of the present study was to 
determine the relationship between serum Klotho (sKlotho) and the presence of 
CVD in dialysis patients.
METHODS: Plasma levels of sKlotho were measured in a cohort of dialysis patients 
and related to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (defined as a LV ejection 
fraction<45%) and LV mass using echocardiography. Coronary artery disease (CAD) 
and calcification score were assessed using computed tomography angiography. 
Abdominal aortic calcification score (AACscore) was measured by abdominal X-ray.
RESULTS: We included 127 dialysis patients, 67±7 years old, 76% male, 67% on 
hemodialysis, median sKlotho 460 pg/mL (25th-75th percentile 350-620 pg/mL). 
Patients with a low sKlotho (<460 pg/mL) showed significantly more CAD (81% 
versus 61%; p=0.02) and LV dysfunction (19% versus 3%; p<0.01). However, after 
adjusting for confounders, sKlotho was not independently associated with the 
presence of CVD or the AACscore.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present cohort of dialysis patients, sKlotho was not 
independently associated with CVD. However, patients with a low sKlotho level 
(<460 pg/mL) did show CAD and LV dysfunction more frequently. Therefore, while 
sKlotho might be a marker for CVD in dialysis patients, the current data does 
not support a direct cardioprotective effect of sKlotho.

Hemodialysis patients have extremely increased cardiovascular mortality. 
Vascular calcification, inflammation, and low serum fetuin-A levels are 
implicated for increased mortality. In this study, relationship between coronary 
artery calcification, inflammation, and serum fetuin-A levels were investigated. 
Seventy-eight hemodialysis patients (38 male, 40 female, mean age: 52±14.5 
years) were included. All patients were on dialysis for more than 6 months. 
Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) are determined by electron-beam computed 
tomography. Serum CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and serum fetuin-A levels were 
measured. Mean CACS value was 488.5±94.5. Serum fetuin-A levels were negatively 
correlated with CACS (r:-0.30, P=0.009). Patients are divided into two groups 
according to total CACS value; group 1 (CACS<10), group 2 (CACS≥10). There was a 
statistically significance difference in fetuin-A levels between CACS group 1 
and group 2 (P=0.001). In this study, serum fetuin-A levels were associated with 
total CACS. This Fetuin-A may play a role in increased mortality in this group 
of patients via facilitating CAC.

Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is a strong vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of soft 
tissue calcification. We assessed the prevalence of functional vitamin K 
insufficiency, as derived from plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), 
and investigated whether plasma dp-ucMGP is associated with all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality in a large general population-based cohort. We included 
4275 subjects (aged 53 ± 12 years, 46.0% male) participating in the prospective 
general population-based Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease 
(PREVEND) study. The prevalence of functional vitamin K insufficiency (i.e., 
dp-ucMGP > 500 pmol/L) was 31% in the total study population. This prevalence 
was significantly higher among elderly and subjects with comorbidities like 
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular 
disease (~50%). After 10 years of follow-up, 279 subjects had died, with 74 
deaths attributable to cardiovascular causes. We found significant J-shaped 
associations of plasma dp-ucMGP with all-cause (linear term: hazard ratio (HR) 
(95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.20 (0.12-0.33), p < 0.001; squared term: 1.14 
(1.10-1.17), p < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (linear term: 0.12 
(0.05-0.27), p < 0.001; squared term: 1.17 (1.11-1.23), p < 0.001). These 
associations remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. 
Whether the correction of vitamin K insufficiency improves health outcomes needs 
to be addressed in future prospective intervention studies.

Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) 
is necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We 
investigated whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would 
identify patients at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using 
data from a large dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly 
diagnosed CUA (n=1030) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were 
matched by age, sex, and race in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without 
CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients and controls were 54 and 55 years, 
respectively; 67% of participants were women and 49% were white. Median duration 
between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA development was 925 days 
(interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable conditional logistic 
regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; higher levels of 
serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and nutritional vitamin D, 
cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with increased odds of 
subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes receiving no 
insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a dose-response 
increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas 
(odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 
3 injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 
for more than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship 
between recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months 
to years before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of 
preventive strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

BACKGROUND: A deficiency of fetuin A is linked to cardiovascular calcification 
and mortality in dialysis patients. But, high levels of fetuin A and chemerin 
correlate with hepatic steatosis and regional adiposity in general population. 
The association between hepatic steatosis and fetuin A/chemerin levels in 
hemodialysis (HD) remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, observational study; 216 prevalent HD 
patients from a single center were enrolled. Baseline serum fetuin A, chemerin 
levels, conicity index and anthropometric parameters were checked. Presence of 
hepatic steatosis was qualified by liver ultrasound and quantified by the 
hepato-renal index (HRI); central obesity defined by waist circumference (WC). 
ROC analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses for prediction of 
hepatic steatosis and central obesity on the basis of fetuin A/chemerin levels, 
anthropometric parameters, and other relevant covariates were performed.
RESULTS: Data from 103 women and 113 men (mean age 60±12 years) were analyzed. 
Eighty subjects had hepatic steatosis and their HRIs were significantly higher 
than those without hepatic steatosis (P<0.001). Serum fetuin A levels were 
positively associated with HRIs (P<0.001) and chemerin levels (P<0.001). Fetuin 
A, chemerin and WC were predictors for hepatic steatosis and central obesity by 
ROC curve. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, fetuin A and WC 
independently predicted hepatic steatosis defined by HRIs. And chemerin 
predicted central obesity and regional adiposity after covariate adjustments 
(all P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum fetuin A levels were higher in prevalent HD patients with 
hepatic steatosis, and positively correlated with chemerin levels. Chemerin 
levels predicted central obesity as well as regional adiposity in the HD 
patients.

Abnormal bone dynamics is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in 
patients with chronic kidney disease. The level of serum intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH) is widely used as a bone dynamic marker. We investigated the 
effect of the mean level of serum iPTH on overall mortality and cardiovascular 
outcomes in incident dialysis patients.
PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD). CKD-MBD is classified as low- or high-turnover bone disease according to 
the bone dynamics; both are related to vascular calcification in ESRD. To 
evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 
on ESRD patients, we investigated the effects of time-averaged serum intact PTH 
(TA-iPTH) levels on overall mortality and major adverse cardiac and 
cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in incident dialysis patients.
METHODS: Four hundred thirteen patients who started dialysis between January 
2009 and September 2013 at Yonsei University Health System were enrolled. The 
patients were divided into three groups according to TA-iPTH levels during the 
12 months after the initiation of dialysis: group 1, <65 pg/ml; group 2, 
65-300 pg/ml; and group 3, >300 pg/ml. Cox regression analyses were performed to 
determine the prognostic value of TA-iPTH for overall mortality and MACCEs.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57 ± 15 years, and 222 patients (54 %) 
were men. During the median follow-up of 40.8 ± 29.3 months, 49 patients (12 %) 
died, and MACCEs occurred in 55 patients (13 %). The multivariate Cox regression 
analyses demonstrated that a low TA-iPTH level was an independent risk factor 
for both overall mortality (group 2 as reference; group 1: hazard ratio 
(HR) = 2.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-3.83, P = 0.023) and MACCEs 
(HR = 1.82, 95 % CI = 1.04-3.20, P = 0.036) in incident dialysis patients after 
adjustment for confounding factors.
CONCLUSION: Low serum TA-iPTH is a useful clinical marker of both overall 
mortality and MACCEs in patients undergoing incident dialysis, mediated by 
vascular calcification.

AIM: To evaluate the association between fetuin-A level (AHSG), its encoding 
gene (Thr256Ser) and arterial function in subjects with normal kidney function.
INTRODUCTION: The aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a predictor for 
cardiovascular mortality. Fetuin-A is a calcification inhibitor and correlates 
negatively with increased vascular stiffness in dialysis patients. The fetuin-A 
polymorphism (Thr256Ser) is associated with reduced fetuin levels and 
accelerated vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Little is known about 
the role of fetuin-A as an independent predictor for the development of arterial 
stiffness in healthy subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 116 subjects with normal kidney function (age 
47+/-12 years, 50 females and 66 males) of the FLEMENGHO study. Calcium 
measurements, plasma fetuin-A, its encoding gene (Thr256Ser) and indexes of 
arterial stiffness, such as aPWV and arterial distensibility, were determined.
RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aPWV (r=-0.21, 
p=0.029). After an adjustment for multiple covariables, fetuin-A levels were 
independently associated with aPWV (r=-0.30, p=0.022) in males but not in 
females. Male fetuin-A SerSer carrier had lower fetuin-A levels and higher aPWV 
(fetuin-A: 61.9+/-29.0 microg/ml; aPWV: 14.3+/-0.9 m/s) as compared to ThrThr 
(fetuin-A: 109.9+/-54.9 microg/ml; aPWV: 6.4+/-1.3 m/s) and ThrSer carrier 
(fetuin-A: 100.8+/-52.5 microg/ml; aPWV: 6.6+/-1.3 m/s). Other calcium variables 
were not significantly associated with arterial stiffness.
CONCLUSION: With respect to common calcium variables, only fetuin-A level showed 
an inverse relation with aPWV in men with normal renal function. Male fetuin-A 
SerSer carriers demonstrate particularly high aortic stiffness, possibly 
implying a status of increased cardiovascular risk.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification, a regulated process in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD), requires vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation into 
osteoblast-like cells. This phenomenon can be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines 
and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CKD rats with vascular 
calcification, we investigated whether inflammatory cytokines, ROS generation, 
and downstream signaling events are associated with CKD-related vascular 
calcification.
METHODS: CKD was induced in male Wistar rats by renal mass ablation and vascular 
calcification was induced with a high calcium-phosphate diet and vitamin D 
supplementation (Ca/P/VitD). At week 3-6, hemodynamic parameters were determined 
and thoracic aorta was harvested for assessment of vascular calcification, 
macrophage infiltration, cytokines expression, VSMC differentiation, ROS 
generation, and related signaling pathway activation.
RESULTS: CKD rats treated with Ca/P/VitD developed medial calcification of 
thoracic aorta and increased pulse pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity. VSMC 
differentiation was confirmed by increased bone morphogenetic protein-2 and 
osteocalcin expression and reduced α-smooth muscle actin expression. The 
expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor were also 
increased. The expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) 
oxidase subunits p22(phox) and p47(phox) were increased, whereas the expression 
of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, Gpx1, and Prdx1) was reduced in CKD + 
Ca/P/VitD rats. Oxidized peroxiredoxin, a sensor of ROS generation, was 
significantly increased and ROS-sensitive signaling pathways were activated in 
the aorta from CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a relationship between inflammation/ROS and 
arterial calcification in CKD and contributes to understanding of the complex 
pathways that mediate arterial calcification in CKD patients.

Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality 
risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though 
common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no 
studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early 
stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 
proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine 
protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by 
electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the 
severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. 
However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, 
parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 
months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of 
calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both 
univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of 
calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the 
severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney 
disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies 
need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery 
calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calcification, or calcinosis cutis (CC), is found in 
approximately 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing 
chronic dialysis. While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it may be 
similar to those for medial and intimal vascular calcifications, which are 
actively regulated processes.
OBSERVATION: In a retrospective study of 9 patients, the role of an active 
calcification process leading to CC was assessed by the immunohistochemical 
detection of osteopontin, which is a regulator of osseous and extra-osseous 
calcification processes. Calcinosis cutis was associated with female sex, 
vascular comorbidity, inconstant secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated 
levels of plasma calcium-phosphorus product. Six patients had a favorable 
outcome after the lowering of plasma calcium levels during dialysis or after 
parathyroidectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcinosis of the vascular media of subcutaneous vessels was the 
most common histologic feature and was always associated with osteopontin 
staining, suggesting that CC is a regulated process. Moreover, to our knowledge, 
extravascular staining of osteopontin in sweat glands, nerves, and macrophages 
was demonstrated for the first time in this study.

Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is a pathological phenomenon that causes 
vascular stiffening and can lead to heart failure; it is common to a variety of 
conditions, including aging, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and a 
variety of rare genetic diseases. These conditions share the common feature of 
tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) upregulation in the vasculature. 
To evaluate the role of TNAP in MVC, we developed a mouse model that 
overexpresses human TNAP in vascular smooth muscle cells in an X-linked manner. 
Hemizygous overexpressor male mice (Tagln-Cre(+/-) ; Hprt(ALPL) (/Y) or TNAP-OE) 
show extensive vascular calcification, high blood pressure, and cardiac 
hypertrophy, and have a median age of death of 44 days, whereas the 
cardiovascular phenotype is much less pronounced and life expectancy is longer 
in heterozygous (Tagln-Cre(+/-) ; Hprt(ALPL) (/-) ) female TNAP-OE mice. Gene 
expression analysis showed upregulation of osteoblast and chondrocyte markers 
and decreased expression of vascular smooth muscle markers in the aortas of 
TNAP-OE mice. Through medicinal chemistry efforts, we developed inhibitors of 
TNAP with drug-like pharmacokinetic characteristics. TNAP-OE mice were treated 
with the prototypical TNAP inhibitor SBI-425 or vehicle to evaluate the 
feasibility of TNAP inhibition in vivo. Treatment with this inhibitor 
significantly reduced aortic calcification and cardiac hypertrophy, and extended 
lifespan over vehicle-treated controls, in the absence of secondary effects on 
the skeleton. This study shows that TNAP in the vasculature contributes to the 
pathology of MVC and that it is a druggable target.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transplantation should favorably affect coronary 
calcification (CAC) progression in dialysis; however, changes in CAC score in 
the individual patient are not reliably evaluated.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: The authors used special tables of 
reproducibility limits for each score level to study, by multislice computed 
tomography and biochemistries, the 2-year changes in CAC in 41 transplant 
patients (age 48 +/- 13 yr, 25 men, dialysis vintage 4.8 +/- 4.3 yr, underwent 
transplant 6.2 +/- 5.5 yr prior). Thirty balanced dialysis patients served as 
controls.
RESULTS: In the study group, Agatston score was stable, and C-reactive protein 
decreased, whereas fetuin and osteoprotegerin increased. In the control group, 
Agatston score increased, parathyroid hormone and phosphate decreased, and 
inflammation markers were persistently twice as high as in the study group. With 
regard to individual changes, 12.2% transplant patients worsened, compared with 
56.6% of patients in dialysis (P < 0.0001). Patients without calcification at 
entry showed slower progression in transplantation (8.3%) than in dialysis 
(44.4%; P < 0.034), and the difference was similar to that observed in cases 
with CAC (17.6% versus 61.9%; P < 0.007). Discriminant analysis indicated 
parathyroid hormone, the modality of therapy (dialysis or transplantation), and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the variables most associated with worsening.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplantation lowers but does not halt CAC progression. 
Inflammation and hyperparathyroidism are associated with progression in the 
populations studied.

Calciphylaxis is a rare disease characterized by calcification of small- to 
medium-sized blood vessels in the dermis and subcutaneous fat, resulting in 
cutaneous necrosis. Although most commonly shown in patients with end-stage 
kidney disease, it has also been reported in patients with other diseases, 
including alcoholic cirrhosis and malignancies. Here, we report an unusual case 
of calciphylaxis in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient with acute kidney 
injury. The patient, a 43-year-old white female with a history of type 2 
diabetes mellitus, alcoholic cirrhosis, and normal kidney function, presented 
with decompensated liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome; she no longer 
responded to medical treatment and required treatment with dialysis. Ten days 
after admission, she underwent liver transplant, resulting in improved liver 
function tests. She had acute tubular necrosis (creatinine peak: 325 μmol/L) 
from sustained hypotension during and after surgery, which required 4 sessions 
of dialysis over 2weeks. Six weeks after her transplant, she developed painful, 
nonulcerating, erythematous plaques over her shins and thighs. Skin biopsy of 
the lesions showed calciphylaxis, calcium deposits, and thrombotic vasculopathy. 
She also developed severe hypercalcemia (calcium level of 2.75 mmol/L) from 
immobility, which required treatment with a bisphosphonate and hemodialysis. The 
lesions improved 6 weeks later, and her renal function returned to normal. 
Calciphylaxis diagnosed in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient with acute 
kidney injury has not been previously reported. We hypothesize that her chronic 
inflammatory state caused down-regulation and low levels of fetuin A and protein 
C. She also had other risk factors, including hypoalbuminemia, obesity, systemic 
glucocorticoids, and alcoholic liver disease. Calciphylaxis can occur in 
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and acute renal failure even after liver 
transplant. Further studies into the pathogenesis of this disease may help us 
understand why it develops in these patients and not others with the same risk 
factors.

Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis 
patients, is associated with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in 
haemodialysis (HD) patients. Whether it predicts stroke remains unknown. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between fetuin A and incident stoke 
in maintenance HD patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: This is a prospective 
observational study. 238 prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean age, 
60 ± 12 years) were followed up for the occurrence of stroke for 55 months. 
Baseline circulating fetuin A levels, biochemical data and other markers of 
inflammation were measured. The major outcome was the occurrence of incident 
ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke.
RESULTS: Thirty one patients had incident strokes; an incidence of 38·4/1000 
patient-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 36·5-39·8/1000 patient-years) on 
follow-up. Patients in the lowest tertile of fetuin A concentration had highest 
risk to have incident stroke (P < 0·001, log-rank test). By Cox 
proportional-hazards regression, patients with higher fetuin A levels 
experienced lower incidence of stroke, hazard ratio (HR) of 0·89 (95% CI, 
0·84-0·96), while those with higher mean arterial blood pressure had an HR of 
1·19 (95% CI, 1·07-1·34) and those with higher calcium phosphate product (CaxP) 
had an HR of 1·39 (95% CI, 1·1-1·73) for having strokes. For patients without 
previous history of diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, fetuin A deficiency 
also predicts the occurrence of incident stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of incident 
stroke among prevalent HD patients.

BACKGROUND: Arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are strongly associated 
with vascular calcification. Hyperphosphatemia is an essential risk factor for 
increased vascular calcification. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients could 
serve as an in vivo model for accelerated calcification. This study focuses on 
the most likely protective effects of magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) on 
phosphate-induced vascular calcification ex vivo/in vitro. Furthermore, plasma 
Mg(2+) concentrations of ESRD and healthy controls were investigated for 
association with surrogate parameters of vascular calcification in vivo.
METHODS: Aortic segments of male Wistar-Kyoto rats were incubated and the 
phosphate concentration of the medium was elevated. The aortic segments were 
incubated in the absence and presence of MgCl(2); tissue calcification was 
quantified by different methods. Serum Mg(2+) concentrations of patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 5; ESRD) and patients without CKD (controls) 
were associated with carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and aortic pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) as surrogate parameter for arteriosclerosis and arterial 
stiffening.
RESULTS: Incubation of aortic segments in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and 
NaH(2)PO(4) caused an increased tissue Ca(2+) deposition compared to control 
conditions. This increased amount of Ca(2+) in the aortic rings was 
significantly decreased in the presence of Mg(2+). In CKD patients, but not in 
controls, magnesium serum concentration was associated with the IMT of the 
carotid arteries. In addition, CKD patients with higher magnesium serum 
concentration had a significantly lower PWV.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Elevated phosphate concentrations in the culture 
media induce ex vivo/in vitro medial calcification in intact rat aortic rings in 
the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Mg(2+) ions reduced ex vivo/in vitro 
vascular calcification despite increased phosphate concentration. This 
hypothesis is additionally based on the fact that CKD patients with high Mg(2) 
serum levels had significantly lower IMT and PWV values, which may result in a 
lower risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in these patients. Therefore, 
Mg(2+) supplementation may be an option for treatment and prevention of vascular 
calcification resulting in a reduction of cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients 
with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and 
mineral metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and 
fetuin A, as novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role 
of calcitonin, another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has 
not been studied in detail.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and the 
total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, 
in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 
and 87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the 
associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × 
phosphate product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact 
PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD.
RESULTS: The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, 
the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, 
and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 
0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, 
phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only 
calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged 
as independent predictors of Gensini score. In the second step, we adjusted for 
the presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and GFR. After these 
adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically significant 
predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components 
of mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater 
severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and 
nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger 
populations including patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

The increased vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has been associated with disturbances in 
mineral-bone metabolism. In order to determine markers of the vascular 
calcification frequently observed in these patients, blood samples of elderly 
male and female hemodialysis CKD patients were used to measure serum levels of: 
osteoprotegerin (OPG), total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB 
ligand (sRANKL), and fetuin-A by enzyme immunoassay; tartrate-resistant acid 
phosphatase (TRACP-5b), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) by 
immunoenzymometric assay; osteocalcin (OC) by ELISA; iPTH by immunoradiometric 
assay; 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), by I(125) radioimmunoassay; and calcium 
and phosphorus by photometric assay. Serum OPG, BAP, iPTH, phosphorus, and OC 
levels were higher and serum 25(OH)D(3), 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and fetuin-A levels 
lower in both male and female CKD patients than in their respective controls. 
Our results indicate that the bone formation and resorption parameters are 
altered in elderly male and female hemodialysis CKD patients. These changes may 
lead to vascular calcifications and cardiovascular complications, given that 
elevated OPG and OC levels and reduced fetuin-A levels are associated with 
cardiovascular events.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular 
and all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and 
analyzed the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers 
and AoAC.
METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X 
ray examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast 
growth factor-23 (FGF-23).
RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score 
≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum 
levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
AoAC.
CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum 
FGF-23 levels were independently associated with AoAC.

BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are major contributors to 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among chronic kidney disease patients. 
The mevalonate pathway may play a role in this vascular pathology. 
Farnesyltransferase inhibitors such as R115777 block one branch of mevalonate 
pathway. We studied the effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 on 
vascular disease in apolipoprotein E deficient mice with chronic renal failure 
and on mineral deposition in vitro.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Female uremic and non-uremic apolipoprotein E deficient 
mice were randomly assigned to four groups and treated with either 
farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 or vehicle. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor 
R115777 inhibited protein prenylation in mice with chronic renal failure. It 
decreased aortic atheromatous lesion area and calcification in these animals, 
and reduced vascular nitrotyrosine expression and total collagen as well as 
collagen type I content. Proteomic analysis revealed that farnesyltransferase 
inhibitor corrected the chronic renal failure-associated increase in serum 
apolipoprotein IV and α globin, and the chronic renal failure-associated 
decrease in serum fetuin A. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor further inhibited type 
I collagen synthesis and reduced mineral deposition in vascular smooth muscle 
cells in vitro, probably involving Ras-Raf pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that farnesyltransferase inhibition 
slows vascular disease progression in chronic renal failure by both indirect 
systemic and direct local actions. This beneficial effect was mediated via a 
reduction in oxidative stress and favorable changes in vasoprotective peptides.

BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a regulator of mineral 
metabolism and has been suggested to play a role in vascular calcification in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data on the association between FGF23 and 
atherosclerosis, both in CKD and in the community, is limited.
METHODS: The total body atherosclerosis score (AS) was determined by a magnetic 
resonance imaging-based angiography in 306 elderly men and women, representing a 
subsample of the community-based PIVUS cohort. Subjects were divided into three 
categories based on AS: AS = 0, low AS and high AS. Serum FGF23 was measured 
using a two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA.
RESULTS: In continuous and multi-category regression models, higher FGF23 was 
associated with a significant increase in the odds of having a high AS (OR 1.43, 
CI 1.06-1.92 to OR 3.01, CI 1.52-5.99). This association was stronger in 
individuals with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 27), reaching a nearly 6-fold 
increase in the odds for a high AS in the upper FGF23 tertile (OR 5.64, CI 
2.78-11.5). We found weaker support for a relationship between FGF23 and the 
presence of atherosclerosis as subjects in the highest FGF23 tertile had an 
increased risk for an AS > 0 in crude models (OR 1.93, CI 1.05-3.55), but this 
was not statistically significant in adjusted (OR 1.42, CI 0.74-1.72) models.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence supporting an association between serum 
FGF23 and total body atherosclerosis in the community. Additional studies are 
warranted to determine the prospective relationship between FGF23 and 
atherosclerosis, and whether FGF23 is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

PURPOSE: Functional vitamin K deficiency (both K1 and K2) is postulated to be 
one of the most relevant links between chronic kidney disease and vascular 
calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommended dietary restrictions in 
HD patients superimposed on diversity of eating habits across the countries may 
affect the prevalence of functional vitamin K deficiency. The aim of this study 
was to determine the level of functional vitamin K deficiency and its relation 
to vitamin K1 intake in HD patients in Upper Silesia in Poland.
METHODS: Protein-induced vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) and 
undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein (ucMGP) were assessed by ELISA in 153 
stable, prevalent HD patients and 20 apparently healthy adults (to establish 
normal ranges for PIVKA-II and ucMGP). Daily phylloquinone intake was assessed 
using a food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: PIVKA-II and ucMGP levels were increased in 27.5 and 77.1 % of HD 
patients in comparison with the reference ranges in apparently healthy controls, 
respectively. In 45 % of cases, the increased PIVKA-II level was explained by 
insufficient phylloquinone intake for Polish population (recommended intake: >55 
μg for women and >65 µg for men). Applying ROC analysis, we showed that vitamin 
K1 intake below 40.2 µg/day was associated with increased PIVKA-II levels. There 
was no correlation between vitamin K1 intake and plasma concentration of ucMGP, 
or between PIVKA-II and ucMGP.
CONCLUSIONS: (1) Functional vitamin K1 deficiency is explained by low vitamin K1 
intake in less than half of HD patients. (2) Undercarboxylated matrix Gla 
protein level is a poor surrogate for functional vitamin K1 deficiency.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) is a frequent complication 
in chronic kidney disease and is considered a risk factor for all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. However, little is known about the pathophysiology 
mechanisms that originate it and the factors associated with its development. We 
undertook this study to analyze the frequency and factors related to de novo 
development of mitral valve calcification (MVC) and aortic valve calcifications 
(AVC) in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
METHODS: A prospective cohort of 124 incident PD patients was studied. 
Demographic and clinical data were recorded and blood assayed at baseline and 
after 1 year of follow-up for calcium, phosphorus, glucose, urea, creatinine, 
cholesterol, triglycerides by spectrophotometry assay; high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (CRP) by immunoturbidimetric ultrasensitive assay, intact 
parathormone (iPTH) and osteocalcin by electrochemiluminescence, fetuin-A and 
osteoprotegerin by EDI-ELISA. Valve calcification was evaluated by M-mode 
bidimensional echocardiogram.
RESULTS: Sixty eight percent of patients were male, ages 43 ± 13 years; 51% were 
diabetic with 1.4 ± 1 months on PD. After 12.3 ± 1 months, 57 patients (46%) 
developed VC: AVC in 33 (57.8%), MVC in 15 (26.3%) and 9 (15.8%) patients in 
both valves. There was no correlation between AVC and MCV. In univariate 
logistic regression analysis, age, diabetes and elevated concentrations of OPG, 
iPTH and CRP were risk factors for development MVC. In multivariate analysis, 
only iPTH remained an independent risk factor as was also the case in AVC.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, diabetes, osteoprotegerin, parathormone and C-reactive protein 
are risk factors related to de novo development of MVC and iPTH for AVC in 
incident dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP (BALP) are 
implicated in the abnormal skeletal mineralization and accelerated vascular 
calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Whereas ALP and BALP may 
predict mortality in CKD, BALP is reported to have higher sensitivity and 
specificity than total ALP in reflecting histological alterations in bone; 
however, results on their associations with bone mineral density (BMD) are 
inconsistent. Here we evaluated associations of total ALP and BALP with BMD 
during up to 24 months in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.
METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 194 ESRD patients (median age 57 years, 
66 % male, 32 % diabetes mellitus, mean body mass index 24.8 kg/m2) underwent 
measurements of total ALP and BALP and total and regional body BMD (by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) at dialysis initiation (n = 194), and after 12 
(n = 98) and 24 months (n = 40) on dialysis.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients had median total ALP 65.4 (43.3-126.4) U/l, BALP 
13.5 (7.1-27.3) µg/l and BMD 1.14 (0.97-1.31) g/cm2. During the study period, 
serum concentrations of ALP and BALP increased significantly (p < 0.001), 
whereas total and regional BMD remained stable. BMD correlated inversely with 
total ALP (rho = -0.20, p = 0.005) and BALP (rho = -0.30, p < 0.001) at 
baseline, and correlations were similar also at 12 and 24 months.
CONCLUSION: ALP and BALP are equally accurate albeit weak predictors of BMD in 
ESRD patients, both at baseline and longitudinally. The dissociation between 
stable BMD and increasing ALP and BALP may possibly reflect increased soft 
tissue calcifications with time on dialysis.

AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid 
artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the 
relationship between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim 
of this study was to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque 
(CAP) in patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to 
the development of CAAC and CAP.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The 
prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC 
and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. 
A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was 
significantly associated with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, 
calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and CAP. In contrast, in the same 
analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with age, male gender, diabetes, 
intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the multivariate analysis, 
CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and calcium-phosphorus 
product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant for CAP. 
Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
(OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a 
high OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51).
CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or 
non-traditional risk factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different from those 
of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be an independent risk factor for each 
other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong relationship between carotid 
calcification and atherosclerosis.

Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to 
mineral bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of 
vascular calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with 
measures of calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with 
end-stage renal disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in 
the serum of patients with epigastric and coronary artery calcification 
(calcification score 100 or more). In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin 
levels significantly associated with age, intact parathyroid hormone, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent calcification. Multivariable 
regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin each significantly 
associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. Receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) 
predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein 
expressions were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and 
non-calcified vessels, suggesting that the vasculature is not a major 
contributor to circulating levels. Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate 
with the extent of vascular calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery 
CT and scoring of epigastric artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers 
of mineral bone disorder, only sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) regulates bone mass by inhibiting osteoclast 
differentiation and activation, and plays a role in vascular calcification. We 
evaluated the relationship between osteoprotegerin levels and inflammatory 
markers, atherosclerosis, and mortality in patients with stages 3-5 chronic 
kidney disease. A total of 145 subjects (median age 61 years, 61% men; 36 
patients on hemodialysis, 55 patients on peritoneal dialysis, and 54 patients 
with stages 3-5 chronic kidney disease) were studied. Clinical characteristics, 
markers of mineral metabolism (including fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23]) 
and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6 
[IL-6]), and the intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid arteries 
were measured at baseline. Cardiac function was assessed by color tissue Doppler 
echocardiography. After 36 months follow-up, the survival rate by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis was significantly different according to OPG levels (χ ² =14.33; 
P=0.002). Increased OPG levels were positively associated with IL-6 (r=0.38, 
P<0.001), FGF-23 (r=0.26, P<0.001) and hsCRP (r=0.0.24, P=0.003). In addition, 
OPG was positively associated with troponin I (r=0.54, P<0.001) and IMT (r=0.39, 
P<0.0001). Finally, in Cox analysis, only OPG (HR=1.07, 95%CI=1.02-1.13) and 
hsCRP (HR=1.02, 95%CI=1.01-1.04) were independently associated with increased 
risk of death. These results suggested that elevated levels of serum OPG might 
be associated with atherosclerosis and all-cause mortality in patients with 
chronic kidney disease.

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), osteodystrophy and arterial calcification often 
coexist. However, arterial alterations have not been addressed in CKD 
unaccompanied by evidence of calcification. We investigated the association of 
phosphate (P) and calcium (Ca) accumulation in calcification-free aortas with 
CKD-induced osteodystrophy. Aortic accumulation of magnesium (Mg), an inhibitor 
of calcification, was also examined. Male mice aged 26 weeks with CKD 
characterized by hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatemia (Nx, n = 8) and 
age-matched healthy male mice (shams, n = 8) were sampled for blood, and 
thoracic vertebrae and aortas were harvested. Bone structure and chemicals were 
analyzed by microcomputed tomography and infrared microspectroscopy, 
respectively, and aortic accumulation of P, Ca, and Mg was evaluated by 
plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Volume fractions of cortical and trabecular 
bones were smaller in Nx than in sham animals (P < 0.05), attributed to cortical 
thinning and reduction in trabecular number, respectively. Bone chemicals were 
not different between the groups. No calcification was found in either group, 
but P, Ca, and Mg contents were higher in Nx than in shams (P < 0.05). The mass 
ratio of Ca/P was lower in Nx than in shams (P < 0.05), but that of Mg/Ca and 
Mg/P was not different between the groups. Aortic P and Ca contents were 
inversely correlated with the volume fraction of cortical bone (P < 0.05). In 
conclusion, the relationship of osteodystrophy with aortic P and Ca accumulation 
suggests the existence of a bone-vascular axis, even in calcification-free 
arteries in CKD. The preservation of ratios of Mg/Ca and Mg/P despite CKD 
development might contribute to calcification resistance.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of the transformation of primary to 
secondary calciprotein particles (CPPs) in serum, including the size of 
secondary CPP (CPP2) aggregates and the time of transformation (T50), may be 
markers for arterial calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We 
examined the associations of CPP2 aggregate size and T50 with arterial 
calcification in incident HD patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident HD patients (n=402with available CPP2 measures 
and n=388with available T50 measures) from the Predictors of Arrhythmic and 
Cardiovascular Risk in End-Stage Renal Disease (PACE) Study PREDICTORS: Serum 
CPP2 size and T50 at baseline.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were baseline coronary artery and thoracic aorta 
calcifications. Exploratory outcomes included baseline arterial stiffness, 
measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ankle brachial index, and 
longitudinally, repeat measures of PWV and all-cause mortality.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Tobit regression, multiple linear regression, Poisson 
regression, linear mixed-effects regression, and Cox proportional hazards 
regression.
RESULTS: Mean age was 55±13 years, 41% were women, 71% were Black, and 57% had 
diabetes mellitus. Baseline CPP2 size and T50 were correlated with baseline 
fetuin A level (r=-0.59 for CPP2 and 0.44 for T50; P<0.001 for both), but 
neither was associated with baseline measures of arterial calcification or 
arterial stiffness. Baseline CPP2 size and T50 were not associated with repeat 
measures of PWV. During a median follow-up of 3.5 (IQR, 1.7-6.2) years, larger 
CPP2 was associated with higher risk for mortality (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.05-1.31] 
per 100nm larger CPP2 size) after adjusting for demographics and comorbid 
conditions, but there was no association between baseline T50 and risk for 
mortality.
LIMITATIONS: Possible imprecision in assays, small sample size, limited 
generalizability to incident HD populations with different racial composition, 
and residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: In incident HD patients, neither CPP2 size nor T50 was associated 
with prevalent arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger CPP2 was associated 
with risk for mortality, but this finding needs to be confirmed in future 
studies.

BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is 
also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study 
was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality.
METHODS: we measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was 
followed during a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were 
applied, as during the follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney 
transplant and death.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of 
diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney 
transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher 
Scl and lower creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality 
and higher Scl (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes 
(HR=2.27), by competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of 
mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained 
significantly related to higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis 
patients. However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able 
to improve these patients survival needs to be determined.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular calcification occurs more often and earlier in 
patients with end-stage renal disease than in normal controls. It is a regulated 
biological process following many of the cellular and molecular programs in 
osteogenesis. This review summarizes some of the regulatory mechanisms that may 
explain its severity in renal patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: A subpopulation of cells from arteries and cardiac valves 
produce a mineralizing matrix and undergo osteoblastic differentiation. 
Osteogenic differentiation regulators are found in calcified but not normal 
arteries. Phosphate levels have dramatic effects on vascular calcification in 
vitro, through a sodium phosphate transporter signaling molecular changes. 
Atherogenic oxidized lipids promote osteoblastic differentiation of vascular 
cells and inhibit bone mineralization. In uremic patients, the severity of 
dyslipidemia corresponds with the progression of vascular calcification. 
Oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators may underlie the effects of oxidized 
lipids. In dialysis patients, the degree of cardiac valvular calcification 
corresponds with levels of C-reactive protein. Genetic factors may also 
contribute. Polymorphisms of the inflammatory adhesion molecule, E-selectin, 
associate with coronary calcification in young women. Mice deficient in matrix 
GLA protein, which inhibits bone morphogenetic protein activity, develop 
complete ossification of the aorta, presumably as a result of unopposed 
osteogenic activity on vascular mesenchyme. Since matrix GLA protein function 
requires gamma-carboxylation of its glutamate residues by a vitamin K dependent 
carboxylase, warfarin treatment may affect vascular calcification by blocking 
vitamin K and hence matrix GLA protein activity.
SUMMARY: These findings indicate that vascular calcification is regulated both 
positively and negatively by a wide variety of mechanisms affecting patients 
with renal disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of 
mortality in chronic kidney disease patients, and it occurs mostly due to 
ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we aimed at investigating the prevalence 
of ventricular arrhythmia and the factors associated with its occurrence in 
nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients.
DESIGN SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: This cross-sectional study 
evaluated 111 chronic kidney disease patients (estimated glomerular filtration 
rate 34.7±16.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 57±11.4 years, 60% male, 24% diabetics). 
Ventricular arrhythmia was assessed by 24-hour electrocardiogram. Left 
ventricular hypertrophy (echocardiogram), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring, and coronary artery calcification (multi-slice computed tomography) 
and laboratory parameters were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Ventricular arrhythmia was found in 35% of the patients. Non-controlled 
hypertension was observed in 21%, absence of systolic decency in 29%, left 
ventricular hypertrophy in 27%, systolic dysfunction in 10%, and coronary artery 
calcification in 49%. Patients with ventricular arrhythmia were older (p<0.001), 
predominantly men (p = 0.009), had higher estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(p = 0.03) and hemoglobin (p = 0.005), and lower intact parathyroid hormone 
(p = 0.024) and triglycerides (p = 0.011) when compared to patients without 
ventricular arrhythmia. In addition, a higher left ventricular mass index 
(p = 0.002) and coronary calcium score (p = 0.002), and a lower ejection 
fraction (p = 0.001) were observed among patients with ventricular arrhythmia. 
In the multiple logistic regression analysis, aging, increased hemoglobin levels 
and reduced ejection fraction were independently related to the presence of 
ventricular arrhythmia.
CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular arrhythmia is prevalent in nondialyzed chronic kidney 
disease patients. Age, hemoglobin levels and ejection fraction were the factors 
associated with ventricular arrhythmia in these patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and 
stiffness.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured in 351 
participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic 
Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was 
measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear 
regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, 
and pulse wave velocity.
RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female gender, 
greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was not 
associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum 
phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with 
concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum 
OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for 
demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors 
such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, 
presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein 
or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161).
CONCLUSIONS: These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and 
arterial stiffness independent of many potential confounders including 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, 
and inflammation.

When using vitamin D, the most important clinical problems are hypercalcemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and vascular calcification. VS-105 is a novel vitamin D 
receptor (VDR) analog. In the present study, we compared the effects of VS-105 
and paricalcitol on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) in a 
CKD rat model. We used male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and performed 5/6 
nephrectomy at 8-9 weeks. At 10 weeks, the rats were classified into five groups 
and administered vehicle, low-dose paricalcitol (LP, 0.1μg/kg), high-dose 
paricalcitol (HP, 0.3μg/kg), low-dose VS-105 (LV, 0.2μg/kg), and high-dose 
VS-105 (HV, 0.6 μg/kg) three times a week for 10 weeks. There were no 
significant differences in blood pressure or renal function among the five 
groups. Alhough serum calcium levels were comparable between the LP and LV 
groups, they were higher in the HP group than in the HV group. Serum phosphate 
levels were higher in the paricalcitol-treated groups than in the VS-105-treated 
groups and paticularly higher in the HP group than in the other groups. The 
urinary excretion of phosphate was greater in the VS-105-treated groups than in 
the paricalcitol-treated groups. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 
decreased and serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) levels were elevated 
after administering paricalcitol and VS-105; however, serum FGF23 levels were 
remarkably elevated in the paricalcitol-treated groups. Further biochemical 
analyses revealed that the calcium content of the aorta was higher in the 
paricalcitol-treated groups than in the VS-105-treated group. VDR and Klotho 
expression in the kidney was significantly higher in the VS-105-treated groups 
than in the paricalcitol-treated groups although both agents increased these 
expressions. Our data suggest that VS-105 had a lesser effect on CKD-MBD than 
paricalcitol except in the case of serum PTH levels. The mechanism appears to be 
associated with the difference in VDR and Klotho expression.

BACKGROUND: Complications associated with atherosclerosis in dialysis patients 
are attracting attention. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory 
glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with 
inflammation and outcome in dialysis patients. In this study, the relation 
between serum fetuin-A concentration and biochemical parameters in patients on 
hemodialysis was investigated.
METHODS: Forty hemodialysis patients, 22 men and 18 women, aged 57 +/- 12 years; 
and 20 controls, 10 men and 10 women, aged 50 +/- 10 years, participated in this 
study. We measured serum fetuin-A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 
biochemical parameters of serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, 
phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone, total cholesterol, triglyceride, 
lipoprotein (a), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), highly sensitive C-reactive 
protein (hsCRP), hemoglobin, and hematocrit in whole blood were also measured 
before starting dialysis sessions. Other parameters included the cardio ankle 
vascular index, age, mean arterial pressure, total weekly urea clearance (Kt/V), 
smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), and duration of dialysis. These variables 
were included in simple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Levels of serum fetuin-A in the hemodialysis patients (331 +/- 55 
microg/ml) were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (361 +/- 
55 microg/ml; P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between serum fetuin-A 
levels and duration of dialysis (r = -0.37, P < 0.01), BNP (r = -0.37, P < 
0.001), and hsCRP (r = -0.40, P < 0.01), and a positive association with serum 
albumin (r = 0.31, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a low fetuin-A level is a useful predictor 
of malnutrition and inflammation, as well as being a useful predictor of the 
cardiac failure caused by an increased ventricular load in hemodialysis 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated 
with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, 
hypertension and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to 
measure VCs in long-HD patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, 
with the occasional use of sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to 
identify the associated factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate.
METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre using a semi-quantitative score 
ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and extent of VCs. The following 
patients' characteristics were compared according to their VC scores: medical 
history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline 
phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses were 
also performed.
RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were studied; the mean age 
was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects were females, 35% were diabetics, and 
they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months (median: 45 months) with a 3 
x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l dialysate calcium and providing a 
mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients were free from VCs and 11% had 
severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were classified into 'classic' (age, 
diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, more frequent warfarin 
treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 'non-traditional' 
(higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and low 
alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with 
a score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared 
to patients with a 0 score.
CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83%) of VCs 
in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy and adherence 
to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic factors such as ageing 
and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure and phosphataemia 
that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association with FGF-23 
serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The harmful 
effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and optimization 
of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients.

    Circulation. 2007 May 15;115(19):2464-7.

BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a multifunctional hepatic secretory protein that 
inhibits dystrophic vascular and valvular calcification. Lower serum fetuin-A 
concentrations are associated with valvular calcification in persons with 
end-stage renal disease. Whether fetuin-A is associated with valvular 
calcification in other patient populations is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the associations among serum fetuin-A 
concentrations, mitral annular calcification, and aortic stenosis in 970 
ambulatory persons with coronary heart disease and without severe kidney 
disease. The presence or absence of mitral annular calcification and aortic 
stenosis was determined by transthoracic echocardiography. The subjects' mean 
age was 66 years; 81% were men; 189 (20%) had mitral annular calcification; and 
79 (8%) had aortic stenosis. Participants were categorized by tertiles of 
fetuin-A concentrations. Those within the highest fetuin-A tertile had 
significantly lower odds of mitral annular calcification compared with the 
lowest tertile (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 
0.77; P=0.002); this association was similar regardless of diabetes status (P 
for interaction=0.34). In contrast, the association of fetuin-A with aortic 
stenosis was modified by the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (P for 
interaction=0.03). Among participants without diabetes, the highest fetuin-A 
tertile had a significantly lower odds of aortic stenosis compared with the 
lowest tertile (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.15 to 
0.92; P=0.03), whereas among participants with diabetes, no statistically 
significant association was observed between fetuin-A and aortic stenosis 
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 4.63; P=0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with coronary heart disease, we observed an inverse 
association of fetuin-A and mitral annular calcification. An inverse association 
also was observed between fetuin-A and aortic stenosis among participants 
without diabetes mellitus. Fetuin-A may represent an important inhibitor of 
dystrophic calcification in persons with coronary heart disease.

AIMS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) 
are specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level 
is associated with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated 
with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict 
a poor outcome in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the 
impact of TRACP-5b on coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear.
METHODS: A total of 71 CAD patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) 
and 28 age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number 
of diseased vessels (a marker of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and 
the Gensini score (a marker of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well 
as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b 
levels were classified into quartiles.
RESULTS: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in 
healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and 
Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels 
were associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate 
linear regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased 
vessels or the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated 
with the TRACP-5b level.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly 
associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary 
atherosclerosis in CAD patients.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), a newly 
defined disorder in patients with CKD, describes the interacting triad of (1) 
biochemical abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
(2) extraskeletal calcification and (3) abnormal bone.
METHODS: We studied the effects of the calcimimetic R-568, R-568 with calcium 
(R-568 + Ca) or calcium (Ca) alone compared with control CKD rats on this triad 
in the Cy/+ male rat, a model of progressive CKD that spontaneously develops 
CKD-MBD on a normal phosphorus diet. Animals were treated for either 14 or 18 
weeks beginning at 20 weeks of age (34-week and 38-week animals, respectively).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated similar efficacy of R-568, R-568 + Ca and Ca 
in lowering PTH levels. R-568 alone lowered plasma calcium compared to control 
over time, but increased phosphorus compared to control early in the course of 
the disease, but not at 38 weeks. Animals treated with Ca alone or R-568 + Ca 
had lower phosphorus levels; the Ca alone group had elevated Ca levels. Bone 
volume improved in the calcium-treated groups. In contrast, arterial and cardiac 
calcification worsened by most assessments in the R-568 + Ca and Ca alone 
treated animals compared with R-568 alone whereas R-568 alone treatment showed 
beneficial effects on most sites of extraskeletal calcification.
CONCLUSION: Thus, R-568, with or without Ca, improved the biochemical 
abnormalities of hyperparathyroidism but with higher and lower calcium levels, 
respectively, compared with controls. However, R-568 + Ca had more dramatic 
improvement in bone volume, but more extraskeletal calcification than R-568 
alone. This complexity demonstrates that treatment of one component of CKD-MBD 
may lead to undesirable effects on other components.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common complication in 
patients receiving chronic dialysis therapy. Although cinacalcet can control 
parathyroid function and bone turnover, preventing ectopic calcification remains 
challenging. Cinacalcet can also suppress PTH secretion due to parathyroid 
carcinoma in the same way as it does for parathyroid hyperplasia in the uremic 
condition. We present a case of parathyroid carcinoma partially controlled by 
cinacalcet, in which tumorous calcinosis was successfully resolved by total 
parathyroidectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A female patient in her forties who had received dialysis for 
12 years was referred to our hospital for painful ectopic calcifications on her 
right hip joint and both knees. Although she had been treated with alfacalcidol 
and cinacalcet for 2 years, this therapy had been discontinued 6 months earlier 
as a result of hypercalcemia. The patient exhibited normocalcemia (2.37 mmol/L) 
and hyperphosphatemia (2.42 mmol/L) with elevated intact parathyroid hormone 
(707,000 μg/L). Ultrasonography revealed an enlarged parathyroid gland on the 
left lower side of the thyroid gland. The otolaryngologist surgeons had to 
perform an en bloc excision to remove this parathyroid gland because of tight 
adhesions. Histological examination revealed that parathyroid cells had invaded 
the surrounding skeletal muscle through fibrous capsules, consistent with 
parathyroid carcinoma. Her joint pain disappeared 2 weeks after 
parathyroidectomy, and the tumorous calcinosis had largely resolved after 1 
year.
CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cause of hyperparathyroidism in 
end-stage kidney disease. Our case indicates that the use of cinacalcet hinders 
the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma in a chronic dialysis patient. When 
uncontrolled hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphathemia develop during cinacalcet 
administration, parathyroidectomy should be considered to prevent a vicious 
exacerbation of ectopic calcification.

INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In 
this study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and 
mammalian Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal 
transplant patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or 
mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial 
stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, 
Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein 
(MGP) concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica, Vienna, 
Austria).
RESULTS: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. 
Mean age was 37.9 ± 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were female. Age, gender, graft 
functions and follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index 
was 15.2 ± 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 ± 14.0% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There was 
no difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between groups. 
Arterial stiffness was positively correlated with age, total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria. MGP levels were 
higher in the mTORi group but were not predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave 
velocity.
CONCLUSION: Rather than specific immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional 
risk factors, blood pressure and proteinuria are the most important predictors 
for arterial stiffness in renal transplant patients.

BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative 
contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients 
CKD stages 3-4.
METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), 
were studied in 178 patients.
RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with age, 
male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, 
but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP 
increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, 
and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients with none (KI 
= 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with 
severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic response to 
FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the 
independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also 
identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a 
patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained 
unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased 
in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9.
CONCLUSIONS: In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with 
FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The bone-related peptide osteoprotegerin is produced by 
vascular cells and is involved in the process of vascular calcification. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the predictive value of plasma levels of 
osteoprotegerin in relation to mortality, cardiovascular events and 
deterioration in kidney function in patients with type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: This prospective observational follow-up study included 397 type 1 
diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (243 men; age [mean+/-SD] 42.1 
+/- 10.6 years, duration of diabetes 28.3 +/- 9.9 years, GFR 67 +/- 28 ml 
min(-1) 1.73 m(2)) and a group of 176 patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes 
and persistent normoalbuminuria (105 men; age 42.6 +/- 9.7 years, duration of 
diabetes 27.6 +/- 8.3 years).
RESULTS: The median (range) follow-up period was 11.3 (0.0-12.9) years. Among 
patients with diabetic nephropathy, individuals with high osteoprotegerin levels 
(fourth quartile) had significantly higher all-cause mortality than patients 
with low levels (first quartile) (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.00 
[1.24-7.27]). High osteoprotegerin levels also predicted cardiovascular 
mortality (covariate-adjusted HR 4.88 [1.57-15.14]). Furthermore, patients with 
high osteoprotegerin levels had significantly higher risk of progression to 
end-stage renal disease than patients with low levels (covariate-adjusted HR 
4.32 [1.45-12.87]). In addition, patients with high levels of plasma 
osteoprotegerin had an elevated rate of decline in GFR.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High levels of osteoprotegerin predict all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, 
high levels of osteoprotegerin predict deterioration of kidney function towards 
end-stage renal disease.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High serum calcium-phosphate levels are associated with 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with chronic kidney 
disease. Recent studies have demonstrated this relationship also in subjects 
with normal kidney function. Our aim was to examine whether calcium-phosphate 
metabolism is associated with the presence and extent of coronary artery 
calcification (CAC) in asymptomatic and apparently healthy individuals.
METHODS: Serum samples from 1088 randomly recruited middle-aged men and women 
without known CVD and diabetes (DM), from the general population, were analysed 
for total calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25(OH)D). CAC was measured by a non-contrast cardiac CT scan and categorised 
into four groups: 0, 1-99, 100-399, ≥400 Agatston units. The association of 
calcium-phosphate metabolism with CAC was evaluated by a multiple ordered 
logistic regression model. All the multiple regression analyses were performed 
in the entire cohort as well as in men and women separately.
RESULTS: In the study population, 96% of the serum calcium values, 93% of the 
PTH values, 90% of the phosphate values, and only 64% of the 25(OH)D values were 
placed within the normal range. In men, the odds of being in a higher CAC 
category, i.e. having more severe CAC, increased by 30% when serum calcium 
concentration increased by 0.1 mmol/l (95% CI: 1.04-1.61, p = 0.019), 
independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In women, no 
significant association between serum calcium and CAC was identified (OR 0.99, 
95% CI: 0.81-1.21, p = 0.91). Neither phosphate, PTH nor 25(OH)D was 
significantly associated with CAC in men, in women or when performed in the 
entire cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum calcium, even with values within normal range and independent 
of traditional risk factors, was significantly associated with CAC in 
asymptomatic and apparently healthy middle-aged men, but not in women.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as 
an important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
calcification over 24 mo.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 134 patients (60 on 
hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 chronic kidney 
disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial femoral artery 
was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave velocity; 
all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
baseline and 12 and 24 mo.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. Progressive calcification 
was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients with an initial 
calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The hemodialysis 
group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who were on 
peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, 
beta blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification 
correlated with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present 
in 20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified 
change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low 
albumin as risk factors for death.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and preexisting 
vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification over 24 mo. 
Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and 
mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification and arterial stiffening are cardiovascular 
risk factors among chronic kidney disease patients. Elevated aortic pulse wave 
velocity (AoPWV) is an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between 
inflammatory and vascular calcification parameters and arterial wall stiffness 
in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated by peritoneal dialysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 57 patients (27 women and 30 men) aged 
from 19 to 75 years (mean age 53 ± 13), treated by peritoneal dialysis during 
4-100 months (mean 30.4 months). The concentrations of albumin, lipids, 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, transforming 
growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), fibroblast growth 
factor 23, fetuin A, parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total calcium (Ca), and 
phosphates (Pi) were measured. AoPWV was performed using a tonometric method, 
common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) by ultrasonography 
evaluation, and calcium scoring (CaSc) with multirow spiral computed tomography 
(MSCT).
RESULTS: In univariate analysis, AoPWV correlated negatively with osteocalcin 
(R = -0.37; P = 0.005) and positively with OPG (R = 0.41; P = 0.002). 
Additionally, AoPWV was significantly positively associated with inflammatory 
parameters: IL-6 (R = 0.35; P = 0.009), TGF-β1 (R = 0.27; P = 0.047), and white 
blood cell (WBC) count (R = 0.33; P = 0.01). There were also positive 
correlations between AoPWV and imaging data: CCA-IMT (R = 0.32; P = 0.02) and 
CaSc (R = 0.38; P = 0.004). AoPWV did not correlate with calcium, phosphate, 
Ca × Pi index, or iPTH concentration. After multiple adjustments, osteocalcin 
was the only significant predictor of AoPWV. In logistic regression adjusted for 
age, hypertension, and mean arterial pressure at AoPWV evaluation, only 
osteocalcin was significantly associated with high (above median) AoPWV values 
[odds ratio 0.96 (0.92-0.99) per unit increase in osteocalcin].
CONCLUSION: OPG concentration and some inflammatory markers (WBC count, IL-6, 
TGF-β1) influenced the severity of arterial wall stiffness in CKD patients. 
Measurement of osteocalcin seems to be the best predictor of AoPWV.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly treated with vitamin D 
analogs, such as calcitriol. Recent epidemiologic evidence revealed a 
significant interaction between vitamin D and magnesium, since an inverse 
relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality mainly occurs in patients 
with a high magnesium intake. The aim of the study was to assess the mechanisms 
involved by determining whether magnesium alone or combined with calcitriol 
treatments differentially impacts vascular calcification (VC) in male 
Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD. Treatment with moderate doses of 
calcitriol (80 μg/kg) suppressed parathyroid hormone to near or slightly below 
control levels. Given alone, this dose of calcitriol increased the prevalence of 
VC; however, when magnesium was given in combination, the severity of 
calcification was attenuated in the abdominal aorta (51% reduction), iliac 
(44%), and carotid arteries (46%) compared with CKD controls. The decreases in 
vascular calcium content were associated with a 20-50% increase in vascular 
magnesium. Calcitriol treatment alone significantly decreased TRPM7 protein (↓ 
to ∼11%), whereas the combination treatment increased both mRNA (1.7×) and 
protein (6.8×) expression compared with calcitriol alone. In summary, calcitriol 
increased VC in certain conditions, but magnesium prevented the reduction in 
TRPM7 and reduced the severity of VC, thereby increasing the bioavailable 
magnesium in the vascular microenvironment. These findings suggest that 
modifying the adverse effect profile of calcitriol with magnesium may be a 
plausible approach to benefiting the increasing number of CKD patients being 
prescribed calcitriol.

Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization 
and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla 
protein MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, 
data from 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were 
analyzed. Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) 
were compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular 
calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications 
were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, 
warfarin-treated male patients had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, 
p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly 
reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men (69.5 
vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the 
use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) 
and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified confounders were age, 
atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died 
during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, patients 
on warfarin had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, 
p=0.001) when compared with those untreated and data adjustment for confounders 
attenuated but confirmed the significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% 
CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In hemodialysis patients, additional studies are 
warranted to verify the risk/benefit ratio of warfarin, which appears to be 
associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality.

disease.

BACKGROUND: Epicardial fat, quantified in a single multi-slice computed 
tomography (MSCT) slice, is a reliable estimate of total epicardial fat volume 
(EFV). We sought to determine risk factors for EFV detected in a single-slice 
MSCT measurement (ssEFV) in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
Our primary objective was to determine the association between ssEFV and 
coronary artery calcification (CAC).
METHODS: 94 pre-dialysis stage 3-5 CKD patients underwent MSCT to measure ssEFV 
and CAC. ssEFV was quantified at the level of the left main coronary artery. 
Measures of inflammation, traditional and kidney-related cardiovascular disease 
risk factors were collected.
RESULTS: Mean age: 63.7 ± 14 years, 56% male, 39% had diabetes, and mean eGFR: 
25.1 ± 11.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Mean ssEFV was 5.03 ± 2.4 cm3. By univariate 
analysis, body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.53; P = <0.0001), abdominal obesity (r = 
0.51; P < 0.0001), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (r = - 0.39; P = 
<0.0001), insulin resistance (log homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance (log HOMA-IR)) (r = 0.38, P = 0.001), log interleukin-6 (IL-6) (r = 
0.34; P = 0.001), and log urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) (r = 0.30, 
P = 0.004) demonstrated the strongest associations with ssEFV. Log coronary 
artery calcification (log CAC score) (r = 0.28, P = 0.006), and log fibroblast 
growth factor-23 (log FGF-23) (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) were also correlated with 
ssEFV. By linear regression, log CAC score (beta =0.40; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), 0.01-0.80; P = 0.045), increasing levels of IL-6 (beta = 0.99; 95% CI, 
0.38 - 1.61; P = 0.002), abdominal obesity (beta = 1.86; 95% CI, 0.94 - 2.8; P < 
0.0001), lower HDL cholesterol (beta = -2.30; 95% CI, - 3.68 to -0.83; P = 
0.002) and albuminuria (log UACR, beta = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.4; P = 0.01) 
were risk factors for increased ssEFV.
CONCLUSIONS: In stage 3-5 CKD, coronary calcification and IL-6 and were 
predictors of ssEFV. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by 
which epicardial fat may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary disease, 
particularly in the CKD population.

Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 
contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor 
activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic 
mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using 
the SM22α promoter (SM22α-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old male 
SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium levels 
but lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and 
gender-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent 
of weight) of the leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not 
significantly different. No significant differences in these parameters were 
observed in female mice. Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits 
in the aortic roots of SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic 
differentiation and mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth 
muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated and cultured. Results showed that SM22α-Rankl 
( tg ) SMCs had higher baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but not 
baseline matrix calcification. When induced by the PKA agonist forskolin, ALP 
activity was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Real-time RT-qPCR 
revealed higher baseline expression of ALP and ankylosis genes but lower 
osteoprotegerin gene in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. Matrix mineralization induced 
by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT 
SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP inhibitor levamisole abolished 
forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not inorganic phosphate-induced 
matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that RANKL overexpression in the 
vasculature may promote mineralization potential.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dialysis patients display an increased mortality which is 
associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Diabetes mellitus and ethnicity 
are known factors that affect the extent of cardiovascular calcifications. 
However, most studies have investigated mixed cohorts with diabetics and/or 
mixed ethnicity.
METHODS: Cardiovascular calcifications were assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian 
haemodialysis patients by the semiquantitative Adragao calcification score 
(X-ray pelvis and hands) and a novel composite calcification score encompassing 
the Adragao score as well as calcifications detected by X-ray of the fistula 
arm, echocardiography of heart valves and carotid ultrasound.
RESULTS: Using multivariate analysis, age, male gender, dialysis vintage, lower 
Kt/V, calcium-phosphate product, smoking and high-sensitivity CRP were 
independent risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications as assessed by the 
Adragao or the composite score. Pulse wave velocity was independently related to 
both calcification scores. Body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, iPTH and 
serum levels of fetuin-A and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein were not 
associated with cardiovascular calcifications.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients, 
age, male gender, dialysis vintage, smoking, calcium-phosphate product, 
high-sensitivity CRP and lower Kt/V were independent risk factors for 
cardiovascular calcifications. Whether lowering the calcium-phosphate product 
and increasing dialysis efficiency can reduce cardiovascular calcifications in 
dialysis patients remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) 
accumulate in arteriosclerotic lesions, playing and important role in the 
development and progression of arteriosclerosis. A chemical quantification 
method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been established 
to determine pentosidine levels in these products. Some studies reported that 
the abdominal aorta calcification index (ACI), obtained by computed tomography 
(CT), was useful for noninvasively diagnosing arteriosclerosis and determining 
its severity. In the present study, we measured the ACI and plasma pentosidine 
in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and investigated the association 
between arteriosclerosis and pentosidine.
METHODS: In 73 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (43 men; 30 women), 
we determined the ACI, and investigated the association of the ACI with plasma 
total pentosidine, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, serum creatinine, 
and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well as the product of serum calcium and serum 
phosphorus, duration of dialysis, and age.
RESULTS: The ACI did not correlate with total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, serum creatinine, PTH, or the product of serum 
calcium and serum phosphorus. Age, duration of dialysis, and plasma total 
pentosidine correlated with the ACI: (y = -33.12 + 0.913x; r = 0.407; P < 0.01), 
(y = 13.94 + 0.403x; r = 0.488; P < 0.01), and (y = 14.13 + 0.630x; r = 0.365; P 
< 0.01), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that pentosidine may be associated with 
arteriosclerotic development in hemodialysis patients. It has been suggested 
that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) accumulate in arteriosclerotic 
lesions, playing an important role in the development and progression of 
arteriosclerosis. A chemical quantification method using high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) has been established to determine pentosidine levels in 
these products. Some studies reported that the abdominal aorta calcification 
index (ACI), obtained by computed tomography (CT), was useful for noninvasively 
diagnosing arteriosclerosis and determining its severity. In the present study, 
we measured the ACI and plasma pentosidine in patients receiving maintenance 
hemodialysis, and investigated the association between arteriosclerosis and 
pentosidine.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular 
calcification (VC), on survival.
METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors completed 40 months of 
follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the superficial 
femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard clinical 
biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had died (27 men and 4 women). 
Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The majority of deaths were 
in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD subjects. The 
outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate 
logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 
0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 
0.26 (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death.
CONCLUSION: We have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in 
CKD stages 4 and 5 over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, 
independent of CRP, is also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms 
remain to be elucidated; however, it is likely that they are associated with 
vascular damage through mechanisms in addition to VC.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent 
of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished 
to determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would 
assist in identifying patients positive for CAC.
METHODS: CAC was detected by multi-slice computed tomography and PAC was 
detected by plain foot radiography. Study population was 112 patients, 54 with 
diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart disease. Demographic and 
laboratory data were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5% with and without 
diabetes, respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more 
vessels affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same 
risk for CAC. In patients with diabetes, age was the unique explanatory variable 
for detecting the presence of CAC, while age and smoking history predicted 
severity. In patients without diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the 
presence of CAC, while parathyroid hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC 
was 63 and 12% in subjects with and without diabetes. PAC detected by foot 
radiography was not an adequate alternative-screening marker for identifying 
patients with CAC.
CONCLUSIONS: CAC is common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in men and 
women with diabetes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) acts as 
a calcification inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The present study was performed 
to (1) determine plasma levels of the inactive, dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated 
MGP (dp-ucMGP) in a cohort of patients at different stages of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and (2) evaluate the association between dp-ucMGP levels on one 
hand and aortic calcification and mortality on the other.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: 107 patients (67 +/- 13 years; 
60% male; 32% at CKD stages 2 to 3, 31% at stages 4 to 5, 37% at stage 5D) were 
assayed for dp-ucMGP and underwent multislice spiral computed tomography scans 
to quantify aortic calcification at baseline. They were prospectively monitored 
for mortality.
RESULTS: Plasma dp-ucMGP levels augmented progressively with CKD stage, with a 
significant difference from CKD stage 4. CKD stage, hemoglobin, age, and 
coumarin use were independently associated with plasma dp-ucMGP levels. 
Furthermore, plasma dp-ucMGP and age were positively and independently 
associated with the aortic calcification score. During follow-up (802 +/- 311 
days), 34 patients died (20 from cardiovascular events). In a crude analysis, 
[plasma dp-ucMGP] > 921 pM was associated with overall mortality; this 
association was lost after adjusting for both age and the calculated propensity 
score.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma dp-ucMGP increased progressively in a CKD setting and was 
associated with the severity of aortic calcification. Plasma dp-ucMGP could thus 
be a surrogate marker for vascular calcification in CKD.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, 
and is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and 
cardiovascular calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available 
on vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, and factors associated with, 
25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in a French dialysis 
center.
DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent hemodialysis patients who had 
not received native vitamin D supplements in the recent past. According to the 
Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative guidelines, patients were 
assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a sufficient vitamin D serum 
level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level (25 to 75 nmol/L); and 
group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' characteristics and 
biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 and 3.
RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; and 
42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% 
and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 
years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean 
schedule of 3 x 6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. 
Concomitant treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% 
of patients) as a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower 
dialysis vintage (53 +/- 66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of 
diabetes patients (45% vs. 21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients 
(53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 
+/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship 
was found between vitamin D storage levels and bone markers, serum calcium, 
phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, normalized protein catabolic rate, 
radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip bone mineral density. In 
multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were significantly 
associated with vitamin D deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis 
population. The associated factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter 
dialysis duration, and higher intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there 
are no guidelines for the therapy of patients with chronic kidney disease at 
stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D supplementation may be assessed by 
considering its potential direct action, the need for providing fuel for renal 
and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and the numerous potential 
favorable effects on health.

We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 
+/- 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 
+/- 17 years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were 
characterized by a good mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 
+/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product 
(46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone 
levels were higher in HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was 
found to be highly prevalent in both groups. Significantly more HD patients 
(62.5%) showed cardiac calcification than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The 
patients were matched for TC scores higher or lower than 400. The two groups 
differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus 
(p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone 
level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval 
was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores (approximately 11%), 
but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients with TC scores 
>400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in both groups (r 
= 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, age, time 
(months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium x 
phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and 
cardiac calcification in uraemic patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) measurements can distinguish 
between cortical and trabecular bone density in vivo. High-resolution CTs assess 
both bone volume and density in the same compartment, thus potentially yielding 
information regarding bone mineralization as well. The relationship between bone 
histomorphometric parameters of skeletal mineralization and bone density from 
microcomputed tomography (μCT) measurements of bone cores from patients on 
dialysis has not been assessed.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Bone cores from 68 patients with 
ESRD (age =13.9±0.5 years old; 50% men) and 14 controls (age =15.3±3.8 years 
old; 50% men) obtained as part of research protocols between 1983 and 2006 were 
analyzed by bone histomorphometry and μCT.
RESULTS: Bone histomorphometric diagnoses in the patients were normal to high 
bone turnover in 76%, adynamic bone in 13%, and osteomalacia in 11%. Bone 
formation rate did not correlate with any μCT determinations. Bone volume 
measurements were highly correlated between bone histomorphometry and μCT (bone 
volume/tissue volume between the two techniques: r=0.70; P<0.001, trabecular 
thickness and trabecular separation: r=0.71; P<0.001, and r=0.56; P<0.001, 
respectively). Osteoid accumulation as determined by bone histomorphometry 
correlated inversely with bone mineral density as assessed by μCT (osteoid 
thickness: r=-0.32; P=0.01 and osteoid volume: r=-0.28; P=0.05). By 
multivariable analysis, the combination of bone mineral density and bone volume 
(as assessed by μCT) along with parathyroid hormone and calcium levels accounted 
for 38% of the variability in osteoid volume (by histomorphometry).
CONCLUSIONS: Measures of bone volume can be accurately assessed with μCT. Bone 
mineral density is lower in patients with excessive osteoid accumulation and 
higher in patients with adynamic, well mineralized bone. Thus, bone 
mineralization may be accurately assessed by μCT of bone biopsy cores. 
Additional studies are warranted to define the value of high-resolution CT in 
the prediction of bone mineralization in vivo.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of valve calcification (VC) in end-stage renal 
disease patients is high and information regarding risk factors is scarce. Our 
aims were to determine the prevalence of VC in our maintenance haemodialysis 
(HD) population and to examine some possible aetiologic factors for its 
occurrence.
METHODS: We studied 90 patients (47 women) on maintenance HD for more than 12 
months. An M-mode two-dimensional echocardiogram was carried out to evaluate 
mitral, aortic VC and ventricular geometry. We calculated mean daily calcium 
intake for the phosphate intestinal chelaing in the previous year to 
echocardiogram date and also mean values from previous year of Ca, PO4, Ca x 
PO4, parathyroid hormone, lipide profile, nutritional and inflammatory marquers. 
Finally consumption of calcium and alfacalcidol was also noted.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (40%) presented with VC. Patients with VC were 
older and showed higher levels of serum calcium (92.00 +/- 7.54 vs 89.27 +/- 
6.86 mg/L, P = 0.04), phosphorus (69.70 +/- 18.33 vs 44.90 +/- 12.43 mg/L, P < 
0.0001), Ca x P product (6164.97 +/- 1797.64 vs 4024.70 +/- 1066.40 mg(2)/L(2), 
P < 0.0001) and poor ventricular geometry, as compared with patients without VC. 
Moreover, they required higher doses of alfacalcidol for treating secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (0.43 +/- 0.60 vs 0.11 +/- 0.46 microg/day, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study are consistent with a role of altered 
calcium and phosphate metabolism in the pathogenesis of VC in HD patients.

BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death among 
end-stage renal disease patients. There is evidence that coronary calcification 
is a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease and is predictive of 
cardiovascular events, especially in patients on renal replacement therapy. It 
has recently been suggested that CHD begins in the pre-dialysis period. However, 
data regarding coronary calcification in this population is scarce. This study 
was aimed at evaluating such coronary calcification and identifying related 
factors.
METHODS: A total of 96 chronic kidney disease out-patients who were not on 
dialysis were included. Patients presenting neoplastic, infectious or 
inflammatory diseases were excluded. Demographic characteristics, clinical 
profiles, laboratory test results and multislice computed tomography scans were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The median age was 55 years (range 20-69 years), 67% were men and the 
median creatinine clearance was 37 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Coronary calcification, 
defined as a coronary artery calcification score (CACS) >0 Agatston units (AU), 
was seen in 61 patients (median 89.1 AU, range 0.37-2299.3 AU). On average, 
these patients were older, more often had diabetes, higher body mass indices and 
higher Framingham risk indices, as well as presenting higher proteinuria, intact 
parathyroid hormone (iPTH), blood glucose and triglyceride levels compared with 
those without calcification. Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted for 
age and diabetes, identified iPTH and triglyceride levels as independent 
determinants of calcification. Severe calcification (CACS >400 AU) was seen in 
22 patients, who were also older and more frequently had a history of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as having higher levels of phosphorus, 
blood glucose and soluble Fas (sFas). Multiple logistic regression analysis, 
adjusted for age and diabetes, identified phosphorus and sFas levels as 
independent determinants of severe coronary calcification.
CONCLUSION: Coronary calcification is highly prevalent in pre-dialysis patients 
and correlates with traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CVD.

BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is 
increasingly recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. 
Circulating levels of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. 
The present study investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are 
associated with all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: We performed a post-hoc survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients 
(68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 2006 who were prospectively followed for 
median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters of mineral metabolism including 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum sclerostin were determined 
in spare blood samples collected at baseline.
RESULTS: Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) 
[median (iqr)] pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were 
characterized by older age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower 
bsAP concentration. During a median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. 
Higher circulating sclerostin levels were associated with decreased mortality in 
prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); 
HR adjusted for age and gender for serum sclerostin levels above versus below 
median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When bsAP was entered in the Cox 
regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in 
the causal pathway.

Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients, is 
associated with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) 
patients. Whether it predicts arteriovenous (AV) access patency is unknown. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between fetuin A and AV access 
patency in HD patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 238 prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean 
age, 60 ± 12 years) were followed up for AV access patency for 32 months.
PREDICTORS: Tertiles of baseline circulating fetuin A levels, corresponding to 
0.15-0.25, 0.26-0.32, and 0.33-0.51 g/L.
OUTCOME: The major outcome was loss of unassisted AV access patency, defined as 
AV access thrombosis or need for intervention.
MEASUREMENTS: Fetuin A and other markers of inflammation.
RESULTS: 100 patients had loss of AV access patency (42%) on follow-up. Patients 
in the lowest fetuin A tertile had the worst AV access patency (log-rank test, 
χ(2) = 8.68; P = 0.01). Using Cox proportional hazards regression with patients 
in the lowest fetuin A tertile as reference, patients in the intermediate 
tertile had an HR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29-0.82), whereas those in the highest 
fetuin A tertile had an HR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25-0.75) for loss of AV access 
patency. Similarly, considering patients using AV fistulas or grafts separately, 
patients in the highest fetuin A tertile had less risk of losing AV access 
patency than patients in the other tertiles (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.19-0.84] for 
patients with AV fistulas and HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.10-0.65] for patients with AV 
grafts).
LIMITATIONS: Focus on the patency of prevalent rather than new AV access in 
maintenance hemodialysis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of loss of AV 
access patency in either native AV fistulas or AV grafts in HD patients.

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 
peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and to determine whether comorbidities such as 
inflammation, dyslipidemia and mineral metabolism disorders correlate with its 
development.
METHODS: Forty-nine PD patients (45% male; median age, 52 years) were submitted 
to multislice computed tomography. Inflammatory markers, anti-oxidized LDL 
antibody, calcium-phosphate balance and lipid profiles were assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (59.2%) presented CAC (median calcium score, 234.7 
Agatston units). Patients with CAC were older than those without, more 
frequently presented a history of coronary artery disease or hypertension and 
had lower HDL cholesterol levels, as well as presenting higher levels of 
osteoprotegerin and LDL oxidation. The logistic regression revealed that the 
independent determinants of CAC were age (odds ratio = 1.12; p = 0.006) and 
number of prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs (odds ratio = 2.38; p = 0.048). 
When the population was stratified by calcium score quartile, soluble Fas levels 
were significantly higher in patients with severe calcification. In patients 
younger than 45, CAC correlated positively with phosphorus levels (r = 0.52; p = 
0.04).
CONCLUSION: In PD patients, CAC is highly prevalent. Our results indicate that 
conditions such as inflammation and mineral disturbances are associated with its 
development.

Vascular calcification is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Medial layer vascular calcification, 
which is recognized to be an active process (i.e. the transformation of vascular 
smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells), is common in CKD patients. We 
have recently reported the possibility of an interaction between elastin 
degradation and medial layer vascular calcification. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 
(MMP-2), which induces the degradation of elastin, has been implicated in the 
elastic calcification in arteries of dialysis patients; however, the precise 
mechanisms by which elastin degradation interacts with the development of 
vascular calcification remain to be studied. To clarify the mechanisms by which 
elastin degradation is involved in the development of medial layer vascular 
calcification in the uremic milieu, we induced aortic medial layer calcification 
in 5/6 nephrectomized uremic rats (male Sprague-Dawley rats) fed a diet 
containing high phosphate (1.2%) and lactate (20%). After 10 weeks, the rats 
were euthanized for the measurement of serum chemistry profiles and histological 
analyses. The uremic rats showed significant increases in blood pressure, serum 
creatinine, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels compared with normal rats. 
Von Kossa staining showed medial layer aortic calcification in the uremic rats. 
In calcified lesions, thin elastic lamellae were observed by elastin staining, 
indicating that elastin degradation could occur in the area. Furthermore, MMP-2 
expression determined by immunohistochemistry was also observed in the same 
area. Elastin degradation accompanied by MMP-2 expression might be involved in 
the development of medial layer vascular calcification in uremic rats.

University, Shanghai 200025, China.

BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the relationship among aortic artery 
calcification (AAC), cardiac valve calcification (CVC), and mortality in 
maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients.
METHODS: All MHD patients in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital in July 2011 were 
included. To follow up for 42 months, clinical data, predialysis blood tests, 
echocardiography, and lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography results were 
collected. Plasma FGF23 level was measured using a C-terminal assay.
RESULTS: Totally, 110 MHD patients were involved in this study. Of which, 64 
(58.2%) patients were male, the mean age was 55.2 ± 1.4 years old, and the 
median dialysis duration was 29.85 (3.0-225.5) months. About 25.5% of the 110 
MHD patients had CVC from echocardiography while 61.8% of the patients had 
visible calcification of aorta from lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography. 
After 42 months follow-up, 25 (22.7%) patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
showed that patients with AAC or CVC had a significant greater number of 
all-cause and cardiovascular deaths than those without. In multivariate 
analyses, the presence of AAC was a significant factor associated with all-cause 
mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.149, P = 0.025) in addition to lower albumin 
level and lower 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) level. The presence of CVC was a 
significant factor associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.800, P = 
0.029) in addition to lower albumin level and lower 25(OH)D level.
CONCLUSION: Lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography and echocardiography are 
simple methods to detect AAC and CVC in dialysis patients. The presence of AAC 
and CVC was independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular 
follow-up by X-ray and echocardiography could be a useful method to stratify 
mortality risk in MHD patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes abnormal kidney function and/or 
structure. It is common and often exists together with other conditions, such as 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The ‘National service framework for renal 
services’ adopted the US ‘National Kidney Foundation kidney disease outcomes 
quality initiative’ (NKF-KDOQI) classification of CKD. This classification 
divides CKD into 5 stages according to the extent of a person’s loss of renal 
function. Stage 4 CKD is defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 15–29 
ml/min/1.73 m2, and stage 5 by a GFR of less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m2. CKD 
progresses to these more advanced stages in a small, but significant percentage 
of people. In 2010, the Health Survey for England reported a prevalence of 
moderate to severe CKD (stages 3 to 5) of 6% in men and 7% in women, as a 
percentage of the total population in England. CKD stages 4 and 5 were reported 
at a prevalence of 1% or less. Although this figure might seem small, it 
translates to a prevalence of up to 520,000 people in England alone. When CKD 
stage 5 advances to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), some people progress to 
renal replacement therapy (RRT). The UK Renal Registry reported that 49,080 
adult patients were receiving RRT in the UK at the end of 2009. Of these, 25,796 
were receiving RRT in the form of dialysis (a population sometimes classified 
CKD stage 5D). As kidney dysfunction advances, there is a higher risk of 
mortality and some comorbidities become more severe. Hyperphosphataemia is one 
example of this, and occurs because of insufficient filtering of phosphate from 
the blood by poorly functioning kidneys. This means that a certain amount of the 
phosphate does not leave the body in the urine, instead remaining in the blood 
at abnormally elevated levels. High serum phosphate levels can directly and 
indirectly increase parathyroid hormone secretion, leading to the development of 
secondary hyperparathyroidism. Left untreated, secondary hyperparathyroidism 
increases morbidity and mortality and may lead to renal bone disease, with 
people experiencing bone and muscular pain, increased incidence of fracture, 
abnormalities of bone and joint morphology, and vascular and soft tissue 
calcification. For adults with stage 4 or 5 CKD who are not on dialysis, the UK 
Renal Association guidelines recommend that serum phosphate be maintained at 
between 0.9 and 1.5 mmol/l. For adults with stage 5 CKD who are on dialysis, it 
is recommended that serum phosphate levels be maintained at between 1.1 and 1.7 
mmol/l. Because of the improved removal of phosphate from the blood through 
dialysis, adults on dialysis have different recommended levels to those with 
stage 4 or 5 CKD who are not on dialysis. For children and young people with 
stage 4 CKD, the NKF-KDOQI guidelines and European guidelines on the prevention 
and treatment of renal osteodystrophy recommend that serum phosphate be 
maintained within age-appropriate limits. For those with stage 5 CKD, including 
those on dialysis, it is recommended that serum phosphate levels be maintained 
at between 1.3 and 1.9 mmol/l for those aged 1–12 years, and between 1.1 and 1.8 
mmol/l during adolescence. Standard management of hyperphosphataemia involves 
the use of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, as well 
as the provision of education and support. However, there is wide variation 
between units and practices across the UK in how these interventions are used. 
At the end of 2009, data from the UK Renal Registry showed that only 61% of 
patients receiving haemodialysis and 70% of patients receiving peritoneal 
dialysis achieved serum phosphate levels within the recommended range. This, 
together with a rising prevalence of CKD, led to the development of this 
clinical guideline on the management of hyperphosphataemia. The guideline will 
assume that prescribers will use a drug’s summary of product characteristics to 
inform decisions made with individual patients. This guideline recommends some 
drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at 
the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The 
prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full 
responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give 
consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be 
documented. See the General Medical Council’s Good practice in prescribing and 
managing medicines and devices for further information. Where recommendations 
have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications 
(‘off-label use’), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Achieving target levels of laboratory parameters of bone and mineral 
metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is important but also 
difficult in those living with end-stage kidney disease. This study aimed to 
determine if there are age-related differences in chronic kidney disease-mineral 
and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) characteristics, including treatment practice in 
Hungarian dialysis patients.
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from a large cohort of dialysis 
patients in Hungary. Patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were also 
included. The enrolled patients were allocated into two groups based on their 
age (<65 years and ≥65 years). Characteristics of the age groups and differences 
in disease-related (epidemiology, laboratory, and treatment practice) parameters 
between the groups were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 5008 patients were included in the analysis and the mean age 
was 63.4±14.2 years. A total of 47.2% of patients were women, 32.8% had 
diabetes, and 11.4% were on peritoneal dialysis. Diabetes (37.9% vs 27.3%), bone 
disease (42.9% vs 34.1%), and soft tissue calcification (56.3% vs 44.7%) were 
more prevalent in the older group than the younger group (p<0.001 for all). We 
found an inverse relationship between age and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 
(p<0.001). Serum PTH levels were lower in patients with diabetes compared with 
those without diabetes below 80 years (p<0.001). Diabetes and age were 
independently associated with serum PTH levels (interaction: diabetes × age 
groups, p=0.138). Older patients were more likely than younger patients to 
achieve laboratory target ranges for each parameter (Ca: 66.9% vs 62.1%, 
p<0.001; PO4: 52.6% vs 49.2%, p<0.05; and PTH: 50.6% vs 46.6%, p<0.01), and for 
combined parameters (19.8% vs 15.8%, p<0.001). Older patients were less likely 
to receive related medication than younger patients (66.9% vs 79.7%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of laboratory target ranges for bone and mineral 
metabolism and clinical practice in CKD depends on the age of the patients. A 
greater proportion of older patients met target criteria and received less 
medication compared with younger patients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association of fetuin-A 
with subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in community-living individuals.
BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a hepatic secretory protein that inhibits arterial 
calcium deposition in vitro. Lower fetuin-A levels are associated with arterial 
calcification and death in end-stage renal disease populations. The association 
of fetuin-A with subclinical CVD in the general population is unknown.
METHODS: Among 1,375 community-living individuals without prevalent clinical 
CVD, we measured plasma fetuin-A concentrations. Peripheral arterial disease 
(PAD) was defined by ankle brachial index <0.90, coronary artery calcification 
(CAC) was measured by computed tomography, and common and internal intima-media 
thickness (cIMT) were measured by carotid ultrasound. PAD was measured 
concurrent with fetuin-A, and CAC and cIMT were measured 4.6 years (mean) later.
RESULTS: Mean age was 70 ± 11 years, and 64% were women. Fetuin-A levels were 
inversely associated with CAC severity. When evaluated as CAC categories (0, 1 
to 100, 101 to 300, >300) with ordinal logistic regression, each SD higher 
fetuin-A was associated with 31% lower odds of CAC severity (proportional odds 
ratio: 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 0.92; p = 0.008) in models 
adjusted for demographic data, lifestyle factors, traditional CVD risk factors, 
and kidney function. In contrast, no association of fetuin-A was observed with 
PAD or high common or internal cIMT in adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower fetuin-A levels are independently associated with greater CAC 
severity but not PAD or cIMT. If confirmed, fetuin-A might mark calcium 
deposition within the vasculature but not atherosclerosis per se.

Introduction. Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent 
predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on 
renal replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class. Case 
report. We report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known 
with CKD stage 5D on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral 
disease, admitted for progressive right leg pain. The physical examination 
detected right dorsalis pedis artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry 
emphasized hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, 
metabolic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray 
of right shin highlighted a vascular calcification with a "train track" aspect 
on the tibial-peroneal artery trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low 
ray regime) showed calcium deposits in coronary arteries walls. Legs 
arteriography and coronary angiography were performed revealing multiple lesions 
on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing of right coronary artery. The 
particularity of the case lies in the absence of angina in a chronic 
hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant angiographically stenosis of 
the coronary arteries were found and successful endovascular therapy was 
performed. Conclusion. The broadening of the indication for coronary angiography 
should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D patients based on a 
risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base imbalances, while 
considering their major influence on the structure and tone of vascular walls 
thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Abbreviations. ABI =

Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both 
divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical 
differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the 
entity and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery 
calcium score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard 
markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla 
protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 
30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 
5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 
males,19 females; D duration 5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium 
score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx 
patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower 
prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 
3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward 
normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was 
evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 
0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 
0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also 
with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, 
notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected 
previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive 
protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive 
parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D 
duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, 
as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification 
inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated 
with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize 
the accelerating role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. 
Assessment of both coronary calcifications and serum levels of calcification 
inhibitory proteins may be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of 
development and progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the 
highest rate.

Calciphylaxis has high mortality. Vitamin K deficiency is common in 
haemodialysis patients and may be a trigger for calciphylaxis due to its role in 
activating matrix Gla protein (a tissue inhibitor of calcification). We report 
the case of a 43-year-old female haemodialysis patient who developed 
calciphylaxis. Two months prior to the diagnosis she was found to have an 
undetectable plasma vitamin K concentration. The calciphylaxis completely 
resolved with vitamin K supplementation and an increase in haemodialysis 
frequency. She did not receive sodium thiosulphate or bisphosphonates. 
Supplementation of vitamin K in deficient patients may improve the outcome of 
this condition.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Progressive cardiovascular calcification in dialysis patients 
with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious complication; however, the 
precise mechanism remains uncertain. We tested whether metabolic calcium 
abnormalities and hypoparathyroidism might have a correlation with 
cardiovascular complications in ESRD patients.
METHODS: A series of 48 ESRD patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or 
congestive heart failure, aged 36-82 (61 +/- 12) years, 23 male and 25 female, 
were enrolled in this study. Serum total calcium (Ca, mmol/l), inorganic 
phosphate (mmol/l), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, pg/ml) levels were 
determined in all cases.
RESULTS: Organic heart disease was confirmed in 28 patients (58.3%), including 
15 with coronary artery disease: 8 with aortic aneurysm, 8 with stenotic 
valvular heart disease, 9 with excessive mitral annular calcification, 3 with 
dialysis cardiomyopathy, and 7 with obstructive arterial disease. Serum iPTH 
measurement revealed hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) in 20 of 48 (41.7%) and 
hyperthyroidism (iPTH >/=200) in 13 of 48 (27.1%) subjects. The 20 patients with 
low iPTH had a higher prevalence of valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca 
level corrected for serum albumin (2.70 +/- 0.30 in low iPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 
in normal iPTH, 2.35 +/- 0.20 in high iPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of 
vitamin D(3) analog use (65% in low iPTH vs. 33% in normal iPTH and 46% in high 
iPTH, p = 0.078). Moreover, corrected serum Ca exhibited a negative logarithmic 
correlation with serum iPTH: corrected Ca = -0.284x log (iPTH) + 3.021 (r = 
0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed diabetes and 
hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) as risk factors for cardiovascular complications 
in ESRD.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in 
conjunction with vitamin D(3) use might play an important role in cardiovascular 
complications of chronic dialysis patients.

Calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a fatal disease in 
dialysis patients due to calcification of cutaneous blood vessels. The 
pathogenesis has been attributed to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, 
recent studies evaluating vascular calcification in nondialysis patients have 
found that the smooth muscle cells play an active role, including production of 
the bone matrix protein osteopontin. To examine the involvement of various 
clinical parameters and smooth muscle cells of CUA, we performed a case-control 
analysis comparing 10 CUA patients with our current dialysis patients. Available 
histologic sections were immunostained for osteopontin, markers of smooth muscle 
cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Compared with our current dialysis 
population, patients with CUA were more likely to be obese, white, and female (P 
< 0.02). Comparison of laboratory values found CUA patients with lower serum 
albumin, greater serum phosphorus, and greater calcium X phosphorus product (P < 
0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in the concentration of PTH or 
calcium between the 2 groups. Immunostaining of calcified blood vessels showed 
that all calcified vessels stained positive for osteopontin, whereas all the 
noncalcifed vessels showed no osteopontin localization. Staining for smooth 
muscle alpha-actin decreased in the medial layer with calcification, with cells 
appearing to be sloughed off, leading to near occlusion of the vessel lumen. Our 
case-control study demonstrates that hyperphosphatemia and an elevated calcium X 
phosphorus product is associated with CUA. Histologic examination suggests that 
the calcification is associated with increased expression of osteopontin by 
smooth muscle cells.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification is a frequent finding in chronic 
haemodialysis patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a significant 
predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. 
We evaluated the influence of aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) on the development of 
LVH in chronic haemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 82 consecutive patients (52 male, mean age 48 +/- 12 years) 
undergoing chronic haemodialysis treatment for > 1 year were subjected to 
echocardiography for the screening of AVS and the assessment of transaortic flow 
velocity and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). The absence (group 1, n = 
42) and presence of AVS (group 2, n = 40) was established. The average values of 
systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure were obtained. Plasma calcium, 
phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein, haemoglobin and 
lipid levels were also measured.
RESULTS: LVH was detected in 59 (72%) of the study patients. The LVMI was higher 
in the AVS group (171 +/- 39 vs. 132 +/- 41 g/m2, p < 0.001). Patients with AVS 
also had higher transaortic flow velocities (1.64 +/- 0.36 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.21 
m/s, p < 0.01) and maximal pressure gradients (10.8 +/- 7.1 vs. 5.9 +/- 3.4 
mmHg, p < 0.01). The LVMI showed a direct correlation with transaortic flow 
velocity in the AVS group (r = 0.60, p < 0.01). Stepwise linear regression 
analysis revealed transaortic flow velocity (p = 0.02), pulse pressure (p = 
0.01) and haemoglobin levels (inverse relationship) (p = 0.02) to be independent 
predictors of the LVMI.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AVS is strongly and independently 
interrelated with LVH in chronic haemodialysis patients. The underlying 
mechanism might be the valve resistance to left ventricular outflow, as shown by 
increased transaortic flow velocities and maximal pressure gradients in AVS 
patients.

Inadequate control of serum phosphate in chronic kidney disease can lead to 
pathologies of clinical importance. Effectiveness of on-market phosphate binders 
is limited by safety concerns and low compliance due to high pill size/burden 
and gastrointestinal discomfort. VS-501 is a non-absorbed, calcium- and 
aluminum-free, chemically-modified, plant-derived polymer. In vitro studies show 
that VS-501 has a high density and a low swell volume when exposed to simulated 
gastric fluid (vs. sevelamer). When male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats on normal diet 
were treated with VS-501 or sevelamer, serum phosphate was not significantly 
altered, but urinary phosphate levels decreased by >90%. VS-501 had no effect on 
serum calcium (Ca) or urinary Ca, while 3% sevelamer significantly increased 
serum and urine Ca. In 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) uremic SD rats on high-phosphate 
diet, increasing dietary phosphate led to an increase in serum and urine 
phosphate, which was prevented in rats treated with VS-501 or sevelamer (0.2-5% 
in food). High phosphate diet also increased serum FGF-23 and parathyroid 
hormone in 5/6 NX rats, which was prevented by VS-501 or sevelamer. VS-501 or 
sevelamer increased fecal phosphate in a dose-dependent manner. More aortic 
calcification was observed in 5/6 NX rats treated with 5% sevelamer, while 
VS-501 and sevelamer did not show significant effects on cardiac parameters, 
fibrosis, intestine histology and intestinal sodium-dependent phosphate 
cotransporter gene expression. These results suggest that VS-501 is effective in 
binding phosphate with no effects on calcium homeostasis, and may have improved 
pill burden and gastrointestinal side effects.

OBJECTIVE: Calciphylaxis, a disorder of calcium-phosphate metabolism that can 
result in arterial calcification, skin and solid organ calcium deposits, and 
nonhealing ulcerations, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
Although its most common cause is secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with 
renal failure, vascular surgeons are frequently called on to evaluate these 
nonhealing extremity wounds. We reviewed our experience of a multidisciplinary 
approach in treating patients with calciphylaxis and nonhealing ulcers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 14-month period at a tertiary center, five patients 
were seen with calciphylaxis and nonhealing leg wounds. Demographics, disease 
characteristics, surgical treatment, and outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: All five patients were black women aged 40 +/- 8.9 years with 
hypertensive renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis (80 +/- 43 months). 
They had large, painful lower extremity wounds or necrotic ulcers (mean size, 
135 cm(2)) that had developed over 2 to 4 months. Three patients had palpable 
pedal pulses, one patient had Doppler pedal signals, and one patient had absent 
pedal flow. Arteriogram was performed in the latter two patients, and one 
patient underwent lower extremity revascularization because of superficial 
femoral artery stenosis with symptomatic improvement. Four patients underwent 
aggressive debridement by the vascular surgical service, and two needed plastic 
surgeon-performed skin grafting. All patients had elevated parathyroid hormone 
levels (mean, 1735 pg/mL; > 25 x normal level); mean preoperative calcium levels 
were normal (10 mg/dL). After either subtotal (n = 4) or total (n = 1) 
parathyroidectomy by an experienced endocrine surgeon, a significant reduction 
in parathyroid hormone and calcium levels was seen (122 pg/mL and 7.9 mg/dL, 
respectively; P <.05). There were no postoperative complications or amputations; 
one patient died 12 months after parathyroidectomy of severe preexisting 
cardiopulmonary disease. Complete wound healing was observed by 4.8 +/- 2 
months. During a mean follow-up period of 9 months (range, 1 to 18 months), all 
wounds remained healed without ulcer recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of calciphylaxis should be considered in patients with 
end-stage renal disease with atypical tissue necrosis or subcutaneous nodules. 
Early recognition of calciphylaxis and multidisciplinary treatment, including 
diligent wound care, frequent debridement, parathyroidectomy, and appropriate 
skin grafting or revascularization, can result in improved wound healing and 
limb salvage.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death for 
haemodialysis patients. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
haemodialysis patients have additional risk factors, including vascular 
calcification. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measurement of arterial stiffness, 
and we wished to determine whether PWV is affected by different factors in 
haemodialysis patients compared to the general population.
METHODS: Aortic PWV was measured in 303 adult patients attending for routine 
outpatient dialysis.
RESULTS: 303 patients, 63.4% male, mean age 68.5 ± 15.8 years, 47.5% diabetic 
with a body mass index of 25.8 ± 5.3 kg/m(2), were studied. Systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) was 148.7 ± 28.6 mmHg and diastolic 80.4 ± 15.3 mmHg. Aortic PWV 
was 9.73 ± 2.08 m/s, and was correlated with SBP (β 0.015, F 5.29, p = 0.023), 
log serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (β 1.58, F 13.85, p < 0.001) and 
prescription of alfacalcidol (β -1.11, F 6.81, p = 0.010). 197 patients had 
corresponding ECHO cardiograms, and in this cohort PWV was associated with SBP 
(β 0.017, F 7.49, p = 0.006), log serum parathyroid hormone (β 0.85, F 5.99, p < 
0.015) and prescription of alfacalcidol (β -0.8, F 4.18, p = 0.042), left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI) (β 0.01, F 11.4, p = 0.001), and log serum 
triglycerides (β 1.43, F 4.79, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that PWV, a measurement of arterial stiffness, was 
associated with both traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including SBP and 
LVMI, but also non-traditional risk factors such as prescription of active 
vitamin D analogues, suggesting a potential link between vascular calcification 
and arterial stiffness in haemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease, which is due in part to progressive vascular 
calcification, is the leading cause of death among patients with end stage 
kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis. A role for vitamin K in the prevention of 
vascular calcification is plausible based on the presence of vitamin K dependent 
proteins in vascular tissue, including matrix gla protein (MGP). Evidence from 
animal models and observational studies support a role for vitamin K in the 
prevention of vascular calcification. A large-scale study is needed to 
investigate the effect of vitamin K supplementation on the progression of 
vascular calcification in patients with ESKD, a group at risk for sub-clinical 
vitamin K deficiency.
METHODS/DESIGN: We plan a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter 
controlled trial of incident ESKD patients on hemodialysis in centers within 
North America. Eligible subjects with a baseline coronary artery calcium score 
of greater than or equal to 30 Agatston Units, will be randomly assigned to 
either the treatment group (10 mg of phylloquinone three times per week) or to 
the control group (placebo administration three times per week). The primary 
endpoint is the progression of coronary artery calcification defined as a 
greater than 15% increase in CAC score over baseline after 12 months.
DISCUSSION: Vitamin K supplementation is a simple, safe and cost-effective 
nutritional strategy that can easily be integrated into patient care. If vitamin 
K reduces the progression of coronary artery calcification it may lead to 
decreased morbidity and mortality in men and women with ESKD.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 01528800.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: La maladie cardiovasculaire, qui est partiellement 
attribuable à la calcification vasculaire progressive, est la cause principale 
de décès chez les patients atteints d’insuffisance rénale terminale (IRT) en 
hémodialyse. La vitamine K pourrait jouer un rôle dans la prévention de la 
calcification vasculaire, en raison de la présence de protéines dépendantes à la 
vitamine K dans les tissus vasculaires, dont l’ostéocalcine. Le modèle animal, 
de même que des études d’observation, témoignent du rôle de la vitamine K dans 
la prévention de la calcification vasculaire. Une étude réalisée à grande 
échelle serait nécessaire afin d’étudier l’effet de la supplémentation de 
vitamine K sur la progression de la calcification vasculaire chez les patients 
atteints d’IRT, un groupe à risque pour les carences infracliniques en vitamine 
K.
MÉTHODE/TYPE D’ÉTUDE: Nous prévoyons effectuer un essai clinique aléatoire, à 
double insu et multicentrique auprès de patients atteints d’IRT, traités en 
hémodialyse hospitalière en Amérique du Nord. On affectera au hasard les sujets 
admissibles qui présentent dans l’artère coronaire un taux de calcium supérieur 
ou égal à 30 unités d’Agatston, soit au groupe auquel on administre un 
traitement (10 mg de phylloquinone trois fois par semaine), soit au groupe 
témoin (administration du placebo trois fois par semaine). Le critère 
d’évaluation principal est la progression de la calcification de l’artère 
coronaire, définie comme une augmentation supérieure à 15% (résultat CAC) par 
rapport au point de référence, au bout de douze mois.
DISCUSSION: La supplémentation de vitamine K est une stratégie nutritionnelle à 
la fois simple, sécuritaire et rentable, qui peut être aisément intégrée aux 
soins aux patients. S’il s’avère que la vitamine K réduit la progression de la 
calcification de l’artère coronaire, il pourrait y avoir une diminution de la 
morbidité et de la mortalité chez les hommes et les femmes atteints d’IRT.

The 24 kD form of secreted phosphoprotein (SPP-24), a cytokine-binding bone 
matrix protein with various truncated C-terminal products, is primarily 
synthesized by the liver. SPP-24 shares homology with fetuin-A, a potent 
vascular and soft tissue calcification inhibitor and SPP-24 is one component of 
calciprotein particles (CPPs), a circulating fetuin-mineral complex. The limited 
molecular evidence to date suggests that SPP-24 may also function as an 
inhibitor of bone formation and ectopic vascular calcification, potentially 
through bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Wnt-signaling mediated actions. 
The C-terminal products of SPP-24 bind to BMP-2 and attenuate BMP-2-induced bone 
formation. The aim of this study was to assess circulating SPP-24 in relation to 
kidney function and in concert with markers of mineral metabolism in humans. 
SPP-24 was measured in the serum of total of 192 subjects using ELISA-based 
measurements. Subjects were participants of one of two cohorts: (1) mGFR Cohort 
(n = 80) was participants of a study of measured GFR (mGFR) using inulin urinary 
clearance, recruited mostly from a chronic kidney disease clinic with low-range 
kidney function (eGFR 38.7 ± 25.0 mL/min/1.73 m2) and (2) CaMOS Cohort (n = 112) 
was a subset of randomly selected, community-dwelling participants of year 10 of 
the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study with eGFR in the normal range of 
75.0 ± 15.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. In the combined cohort, the mean SPP-24 was 
167.7 ± 101.1 ng/mL (range 33.4-633.6 ng/mL). The mean age was 66.5 ± 11.3, 
57.1% female and mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) was 59.9 ± 27.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 
8-122 mL/min/1.73 m2). There was a strong inverse correlation between SPP-24 and 
eGFR (R = - 0.58, p < 0.001) that remained after adjustment for age. Following 
adjustment for age, eGFR, and sex, SPP-24 was significantly associated with 
phosphate (R = - 0.199), PTH (R = 0.298), and the Wnt-signaling inhibitor 
Dickkopf-related protein 1 (R = - 0.156). The results of this study indicate 
that SPP-24 is significantly altered by kidney function and is the first human 
data linking levels of SPP-24 to other biomarkers involved in mineral 
metabolism. Whether there is a role for circulating SPP-24 in bone formation and 
ectopic mineralization requires further study.

AIM: Fetuin-A is a hepatic glycoprotein that inhibits extraosseous 
calcification. Lower serum fetuin-A concentration was associated with severe 
arterial calcification in patients with end stage renal disease. We evaluated 
the association of serum fetuin-A levels and the severity of atherosclerosis in 
patients with peripheral vascular disease having normal renal function.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study among 93 chronic atherosclerotic patients 
with lower extremity vascular disease, systemic atherosclerosis and 
calcification was assessed by ultrasound (carotid intima-media thickness/IMT/, 
calcification at the abdominal aorta, carotid and femoral bifurcations, aortic 
and mitral valves) and angiography (Bollinger score). Standard serum markers of 
inflammation, diabetes, renal function, ankle-brachial indexes and traditional 
risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted and Fontaine classification was 
applied for the severity of symptoms.
RESULTS: The patients mean (SD) age was 59.95 (7.61) years, 78% were men, 35% 
had diabetes. Serum fetuin-A level showed significant negative correlation with 
ultrasound calcification score (P=0.018, r=-0.257) and Bollinger angiographic 
score (P=0.035, r=-0.347). Fetuin-A did not correlate with IMT or Fontaine 
classification. Fetuin-A also showed significant correlation with albumin, 
transferrin and hemoglobin A1c (r=0.287, 0.305 and 0.219, respectively at 
P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between fetuin-A 
and calcification score (OR: 3.03, CI: 1.05-8.7), P=0.039) independent of 
traditional risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that serum fetuin-A levels inversely correlate with 
the severity of atherosclerosis in nonuremic patients with symptomatic chronic 
lower limb ischemia. These data support a putative protective role for fetuin-A 
in the development of arterial calcification.

BACKGROUND: Peritoneal calcification (PC) is a specific finding in patients 
undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but its prevalence, risk factors, and 
impacts in PD patients remain unclear. The present study investigated these 
issues and provided information useful for the management of PC.
METHODS: The study included 183 PD patients. The severity of PC was determined 
using abdominal computed tomography (CT), and we summed up all scores from 
slices obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor normalized to body 
surface area. We analyzed the associations between PC and demographic and 
clinical characteristics, and between PC and levels of biomarkers, including 
C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegrin and fetuin-A. The determinants of PC 
were examined using multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients were categorized into group 1 (without PC, n = 133) and group 
2 (with PC, n = 50). Group 2 patients showed different degrees of PC with a mean 
of 160±769 mm(2)/m(2). Group 1 patients had higher fetuin-A levels than group 2 
patients (861±309 vs. 760±210 µg/mL; p = 0.021). The independent risk factors 
for the presence of PC included male gender, previous peritonitis, and PD 
adequacy (KT/V). Further analysis performed in group 2 patients showed that the 
dosage of vitamin D, serum levels of CRP, and dialysate calcium load were the 
independent determinants of PC. However, the presence of PC did not affect 
patients' technique survival, peritonitis incidence, or mortality in the mean 
follow up period of 28±12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence and severity of PC were associated with inflammation, 
peritoneal KT/V, and mineral metabolism. The impact of PC on the outcomes of PD 
patients requires further study with a longer follow-up.

BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of 
Cinacalcet plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with 
Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the 
effect of cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of 
active vitamin D on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 
haemodialysis patients. We report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject 
characteristics.
METHODS: ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized, open-label study. 
Adult haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact 
PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score 
(>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet 
(30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin D (cinacalcet group) or flexible 
dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The study had three phases: 
screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC scores obtained by 
cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and weeks 28 and 52. 
The primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from baseline to Week 
52.
RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or control. Mean age 
was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 36.7 months 
(range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the Agatston 
method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score was 
independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH. 
Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The 
ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
vascular calcification.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a relevant problem in patients on 
dialysis. Cinacalcet in regular clinical practice increases the percentage of 
patients achieving treatment targets for PTH, Ca and P. We evaluated allograft 
calcification in serial protocol biopsies after transplantation among patients 
receiving Cinacalcet on dialysis but discontinued after surgery.
METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study included kidney allograft 
recipients who were receiving Cinacalcet for more than 6 months before surgery 
and had it withdrawn thereafter. The 46 patients including 17 women showed a 
mean overall age of 54 ± 30 years. Protocol graft biopsy was performed at 3 and 
at 12 months. Biochemical analyses at the time of biopsy included blood levels 
of creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatases, iPTH, and 
proteinuria.
RESULTS: Any biopsy showed nephrocalcinosis either intratubular calcifications, 
or in the parenchyma. There were no changes in calcemia (10.22 ± 0.7 to 10.27 ± 
0.7 mg/dL), in alkaline phosphatase (259 ± 119.6 to 255 ± 122.3 mg/dL) nor in 
iPTH (317 ± 220.2 to 320 ± 168.8 pg/mL) between 3 and 12 months respectively. 
There was a slight but non-significant increase in serum phosphorus (2.79 ± 0.8 
to 3.22 ± 0.9 mg/dL), serum creatinine (1.53 ± 0.6 to 1.84 ± 1.2 mg/dL) and 
proteinuria (528 ± 603 to 879 ± 1398 mg/24h) between 3 and 12 months 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of Cinacalcet at the time of renal transplantation was 
not a risk factor for allograft calcifications in the early post-transplant 
period.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is characterized by 
increased circulating levels of parathormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth 
factor 23 (FGF23), bone disease, and vascular calcification, and is associated 
with adverse outcomes. We studied the prevalence of mineral metabolism 
disorders, and the potential relationship between decreased estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD-MBD in coronary artery disease patients in a 
cross-sectional study of 704 outpatients 7.5 ± 3.0 months after an acute 
coronary syndrome. The mean eGFR (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration formula) was 
75.8 ± 19.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Our patients showed lower calcidiol plasma levels 
than a healthy cohort from the same geographical area. In the case of men, this 
finding was present despite similar creatinine levels in both groups and older 
age of the healthy subjects. Most patients (75.6 %) had an eGFR below 
90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (eGFR categories G2-G5), with 55.3 % of patients exhibiting 
values of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (G2). PTH (r = -0.3329, p < 0.0001) and FGF23 
(r = -0.3641, p < 0.0001) levels inversely correlated with eGFR, whereas 
calcidiol levels and serum phosphate levels did not. Overall, PTH levels were 
above normal in 34.9 % of patients. This proportion increased from 19.4 % in G1 
category patients, to 33.7 % in G2 category patients and 56.6 % in G3-G5 
category patients (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, eGFR and calcidiol 
levels were the main independent determinants of serum PTH. The mean FGF23 
levels were 69.9 (54.6-96.2) relative units (RU)/ml, and 33.2 % of patients had 
FGF23 levels above 85.5 RU/ml (18.4 % in G1 category patients, 30.0 % in G2 
category patients, and 59.2 % in G3-G5 category patients; p < 0.001). In 
multivariate analysis, eGFR was the main predictor of FGF23 levels. Increased 
phosphate levels were present in 0.7 % of the whole sample: 0 % in G1 category 
patients, 0.3 % in G2 category patients, and 2.8 % in G3-G5 category patients 
(p = 0.011). Almost 90 % of patients had calcidiol insufficiency without 
significant differences among the different degrees of eGFR. In conclusion, in 
patients with coronary artery disease there is a large prevalence of increased 
FGF23 and PTH levels. These findings have an independent relationship with 
decreased eGFR, and are evident at an eGFR of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Then, mild 
decreases in eGFR must be taken in consideration by the clinician because they 
are associated with progressive abnormalities of mineral metabolism.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with end-stage renal disease are susceptible to cardiac 
valve calcification (CVC) due to mineral metabolism disorders and other factors. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors for new-onset CVC 
in patients on maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: This study included patients who underwent PD catheter insertion from 
January 2006 to June 2013 in our Peritoneal Dialysis Center. Clinical data were 
collected on CVC status during echocardiography evaluations (twice) at an 
interval of >6 months. The data collected included intact parathyroid hormone, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), serum phosphorus (P), serum calcium (Ca), albumin 
(Alb), prealbumin and the use of five types of antihypertensive drugs, statins, 
active vitamin D3 and Ca tablets.
RESULTS: In total, 194 patients - 105 (54.1%) men, average age 60.5 ± 13.0 years 
- were included. CVC was present in 50 (25.8%) patients during PD catheter 
placement. After an average PD duration of 20.9 ± 10.4 months, CVC was detected 
in 97 patients (50.0%). New-onset CVC was found in 62 patients (32.0%). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only serum P levels (p = 
0.01, OR = 2.569), Alb levels (p = 0.04, OR = 0.935), dialysis duration (p = 
0.03, OR = 1.039) and CRP levels (p = 0.02, OR = 1.031) were associated with 
CVC.
CONCLUSION: Serum P, Alb and CRP levels as well as dialysis duration are 
independent risk factors for CVC.

BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures 
(VFs), providing information on both their number and severity.
METHODS: We evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical 
and arterial calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, 
assessed by quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were 
identified in the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of 
fracture severity, we created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the 
number of VFs. We assessed routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), 
undercaboxylated BGP (ucBGP), and matrix-Gla-protein (MGP).
RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD patients with a SDI >1 were more 
frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP (p<0.01). Patients with a c-SDI >1 
had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP (p<0.05). 
Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC) were more frequent in patients with 
SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression 
showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91), age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) and 
albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 
1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI 1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, 
CI 0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity of VFs was associated with age, 
atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women undergoing chronic hemodialysis are at risk of 
uremic bone disease and postmenopausal osteoporosis. There are few reports 
discussing the effects of raloxifene hydrochloride on chronic hemodialysis 
patients. We investigated whether differences in the effects of raloxifene on 
bone mineral density (BMD) are dependent on the level of intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH).
METHODS: 47 postmenopausal hemodialysis patients with osteoporosis were divided 
into two groups, i.e. Group A, with treatment, and Group B, without treatment by 
raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day, three times per week) for 1 year. We 
evaluated the changes in BMD at the distal one-third of the radial bone and 
aortic calcification index (ACI) by plain abdominal computerized tomography. 
Furthermore, we compared the BMD and ACI results for patients with similar iPTH 
levels within each group.
RESULTS: After 1 year of raloxifene treatment, patients with iPTH levels of < 
250 pg/ml in Group A showed significantly less BMD deterioration than similar 
patients in Group B (A: -0.31 +/- 1.7% vs. B: -3.71 +/- 0.7%, p = 0.04). 
However, raloxifene showed no difference in patients with iPTH levels of > or = 
250 pg/ml in the two groups (A: -3.49 +/- 0.7% vs. B: -6.10 +/- 1.9%, p = 0.09). 
Among the patients with iPTH levels of < 250 pg/ml, changes in the ACI values 
were 1.30 +/- 0.3% for Group A and 1.67 +/- 1.0% for Group B. Among the patients 
with iPTH levels of (3) 250 pg/ml, the ACI values were 2.58 +/- 0.7% for Group A 
and 3.01 +/- 1.2% for Group B.
CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene treatment was useful for the prevention of BMD 
deterioration in postmenopausal dialysis patients with controlled iPTH levels.

Paradoxically, higher serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG: a vascular 
calcification inhibitor) have been associated with increased arterial stiffness, 
risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. A few studies reported 
that post-transplant OPG levels are associated with mortality in kidney 
transplant (KT) recipients. In this study, this association was assessed in a 
cohort of prevalent KT recipients, adjusting for previously untested potential 
confounders, including fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and interleukin 6 
(IL-6). Socio-demographic and clinical parameters, medical and transplant 
history, and laboratory data were collected from 982 prevalent KT recipients. 
The association between serum OPG and all-cause mortality over a 6-year 
follow-up period was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 
multivariable adjusted Cox regression models. Participants with high serum OPG 
were more likely female, older, deceased donor KT recipients and have more 
comorbidity, lower eGFR, higher FGF23, higher IL-6, and longer dialysis vintage. 
Each 1 pmol/L higher-serum OPG level was associated with a 49% higher risk of 
mortality (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.49 [1.40 - 
1.61]). This association persisted after adjusting for confounders (HR [95% CI]: 
1.20 [1.10 - 1.30]). In conclusion, serum OPG was associated with all-cause 
mortality independent of several novel confounders in prevalent KT recipients.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients.
METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and 
gender-matched nondialysis control subjects were evaluated by echocardiography 
and a severity score for VC was determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was 
evaluated at the beginning of haemodialysis.
RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients than in normal 
patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% vs 4.3%, P = 
0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older than 
patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, had 
longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) 
and the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also 
found a positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No 
correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid 
hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most 
predictive parameters for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification 
was associated more frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, 
valvular insufficiency and with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic 
calcification was correlated with age (r = 0.42) and longer duration of 
predialysis arterial hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and 
selected age and calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. 
These findings support careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the 
early stages of end-stage renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), known to regulate bone mass 
by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation, might also play a role 
in vascular calcification. Increased circulating OPG levels in patients with CKD 
are associated with aortic calcification and increased mortality. We assessed 
the predictive role of OPG for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 
patients with CKD stages 3-5 over a 5-year follow-up period. We evaluated the 
relationship between OPG and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 145 CKD 
patients (stages 3-5) in a prospective observational follow-up study. 
Inflammation markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, standard 
echocardiography, and estimation of intima-media thickness in the common carotid 
artery, were assessed at baseline, and correlations with OPG levels were 
determined. The cutoff values for OPG were defined using ROC curves for 
cardiovascular mortality. Survival was assessed during follow up lasting for up 
to 5.5 years using Fine and Gray model. A total of 145 (89 men; age 
58.9 ± 15.0 years) were followed up. The cutoff value for OPG determined using 
ROC was 10 pmol/L for general causes mortality and 10.08 pmol/L for CV causes 
mortality. Patients with higher serum OPG levels presented with higher mortality 
rates compared to patients with lower levels. Aalen-Johansen cumulative 
incidence curve analysis demonstrated significantly worse survival rates in 
individuals with higher baseline OPG levels for all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, OPG was a marker of general and 
cardiovascular mortality independent of sex, age, CVD, diabetes, and CRP levels. 
When CKD stages were included in the multivariate analysis, OPG was an 
independent marker of all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality. 
Elevated serum OPG levels were associated with higher all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of age, CVD, diabetes, and 
inflammatory markers, in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanism of calcium deposition in soft tissues is 
of great importance in a variety of pathological conditions such as chronic 
kidney disease. The present study examined the role of phytate and osteopontin 
during the development of soft tissue calcification in an animal model.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats (16 rats per treatment) were fed with a diet (AIN-76A) 
in which phytate is undetectable (non-phytate-treated group), or with a 
phytin-enriched AIN-76A diet (phytate-treated group). After 21 days on the 
respective diets, all rats were subjected to calcinosis induction by 
subcutaneous injection with KMnO4 at 2 sites on either side of the interscapular 
region. At 2, 5, 8 and 10 days after the calcinosis induction, 4 rats of each 
group were sacrificed, and the injured tissues were removed for histological 
analysis and for calcium determination.
RESULTS: Calcification was notably and significantly reduced in phytate-treated 
rats compared with non-phytate-treated rats. Calcified deposits appeared as soon 
as 2 days after calcinosis induction, but inflammation with the presence of 
macrophages, lymphocytes and eosinophils was not typically observed until 5 days 
postinduction. Osteopontin was only detected 8 days postinduction, and was 
clearly associated with calcified areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest an important role for crystallization 
inhibitors such as phytate in reducing hydroxyapatite crystal formation in the 
first steps of soft tissue calcification. Histological analysis indicated that 
osteopontin was not involved during initiation of soft tissue calcification. 
Osteopontin appears be involved in the control of calcification rather than its 
genesis.

Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC) is a syndrome in which bilateral 
cerebral calcification occurs despite the absence of abnormal calcium 
metabolism. A 17-year-old Japanese female was admitted for investigation of 
intermittent proteinuria from the age of 12 years. On admission, her blood 
pressure was 126/60 mmHg and her serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL. Although 
computed tomography revealed bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis, her level 
of intelligence and neurological findings were normal, as were the results of 
endocrine tests including parathyroid hormone. Asymptomatic IBGC was diagnosed. 
Renal biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Peritoneal 
dialysis was started for end-stage renal failure when she was 24 years old. 
Pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs started to develop at the age of 27 years and 
progressed, resulting in death from aspiration pneumonia at the age of 32 years. 
Post-mortem revealed bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia, dentate 
nucleus, thalamus, and centrum semiovale. On light microscopy, there was 
circumferential calcification of the media and intima of affected vessels in the 
brain, including small arteries, small veins, and capillaries, and luminal 
narrowing was seen. On electron microscopy, layers of differing electron density 
were arranged in concentric laminae. This is the first report of IBGC with 
bilateral and symmetrical cerebral calcification accompanied by 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis resulting in end-stage renal failure.

BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare cutaneous disorder, characterized by 
vascular calcification and progressive skin necrosis, not yet described in cats. 
It is scarcely reported in animals, mostly due to iatrogenic or uraemic 
disturbances of the calcium-phosphate balance. In human patients, it is most 
commonly seen with end-stage renal disease, but several nonuraemic disorders, 
including inherited dysfunctions of tissue calcification inhibitors, have also 
been described.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of nonuraemic calciphylaxis in a cat.
ANIMALS: A 10-week-old male domestic short hair kitten was presented with 
hyperacute skin lesions. Initial dermatological signs were characterized by 
sharp demarcated erosions and ulcerations on the face, including the nasal 
planum and lips. Cutaneous lesions rapidly progressed into thick crusts with 
ulcerations, involving parts of the face and pinna as well as abdominal skin.
METHODS: Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, urinalysis, parathyroid 
hormone measurement and histopathological examination of skin biopsies.
RESULTS: Histopathology from newly developed abdominal skin lesions revealed 
severe epidermal necrosis and calcification, multifocal pannicular calcification 
and calcified subcutaneous vessels, supporting a diagnosis of calciphylaxis. 
Treatment consisted of systemic and topical antimicrobials, analgesics, 
pentoxifylline, Lantharenol(®) , sodium thiosulfate and vitamin K. After 
initiation of therapy, no further progression was noticed; all medications could 
be discontinued eventually, and no relapse was seen in the following 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Calciphylaxis should be considered as a 
differential diagnosis for ulcerative cutaneous disorders in young cats. More 
information on this disease is needed to elucidate the pathomechanism.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is thought to be associated with 
greater cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease than 
in nonuremic persons. The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects 
of etidronate, a synthetic analogue of pyrophosphate, on progression of CAC 
score.
METHODS: The extent of CAC was evaluated by using multidetector spiral computed 
tomography. Repeated CAC score estimation was possible in 35 patients (29 men, 6 
women). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry. Serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) was measured by using enzyme-linked 
immunoassay. Serum etidronate was measured by means of the gas spectrometry 
technique using deuterium-labeled etidronate as internal standard.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 63.2 +/- 8.2 (SD) years, and mean duration of 
dialysis therapy was 7.4 +/- 5.5 years. CAC score was estimated 3 times in each 
patient. After the second CAC score estimation, 35 patients were administered 
etidronate, 200 mg/d, for 14 days. This cycle was repeated 3 times every 90 
days. CAC progression was significantly less pronounced during treatment with 
etidronate compared with the period before treatment was initiated. The median 
annualized absolute increase in calcified volume was 195.0 mm3 without treatment 
compared with -490.0 mm3 during treatment ( P < 0.01). Patients were divided 
into 2 groups based on changes in CAC score during etidronate treatment. 
Responders (n = 26) were patients whose CAC score decreased during therapy, and 
nonresponders (n = 9) were patients whose CAC score increased, even after 
etidronate therapy. Serum C-reactive protein values (0.18 +/- 0.13 mg/dL) in the 
responder group were greater than those (0.14 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) in the 
nonresponder group ( P = 0.013). Serum OPG levels decreased significantly during 
etidronate therapy (256.8 +/- 93.8 versus 245.0 +/- 83.0 pg/mL; P = 0.0161). 
Etidronate was well tolerated during the study. BMD values during etidronate 
therapy were not significantly changed from 0.941 +/- 0.125 to 0.968 +/- 0.246 
g/cm2.
CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggest that the extent of CAC may be 
suppressed by etidronate in association with a reduction in chronic inflammatory 
responses. They also suggest that a decrease in serum OPG concentrations by 
means of etidronate may be associated with changes in vascular calcification in 
dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calciphylaxis, seen most often in dialysis patients, is 
characterised by skin necrosis, and is a disabling and lifethreatening disease. 
Despite intensive topical treatment, recourse to parathyroidectomy is often 
necessary. We report the case of a female patient with skin necrosis due to 
calciphylaxis: pain and necrotic lesions were controlled by grafting of cultured 
autologous keratinocytes (Epibase).
CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old woman with a 5-year history of dialysis-dependent 
chronic renal failure secondary to nephroangiosclerosis presented a very painful 
necrotic ulceration on her left leg. In spite of an autologous patch grafts, the 
lesions rapidly deteriorated. Laboratory data showed high levels of calcium, 
phosphate and parathyroid hormone and imaging suggested parathyroidal adenoma. 
Although cutaneous biopsy was not performed, the diagnosis of cutaneous necrosis 
due to calciphylaxis with tertiary hyperparathyroidism was established. 
Treatment consisted of a low-calcium and low-phosphorus diet with autologous 
keratinocytes grafts (Epibase). After the third application of keratinocytes, 
the pain disappeared, necrosis ceased and wound healing began. Subtotal 
parathyroidectomy was performed two months after the start of grafts. At three 
months, the patient was cured.
DISCUSSION: . Calciphylaxis is an obstructive vascular disease secondary to 
calcification of the arterioles leading to ischemic tissue necrosis. Prompt 
diagnosis is essential since this disease is disabling and life-threatening due 
to sepsis and ischemic complications. In our case, autologous keratinocyte 
grafts allowed pain relief to be achieved within large expanses of cutaneous 
necrosis after correction of calcium and phosphorus levels, thereby allowing 
parathyroidectomy to be performed under optimal conditions.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is one of the common 
complications in dialysis patients, and is associated with increased risk of 
vascular calcification. The effects of cinacalcet hydrochloride treatment on 
bone and mineral metabolism have been previously reported, but the benefit of 
cinacalcet on vascular calcification remains uncertain. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the impact of cinacalcet on abdominal aortic calcification in 
dialysis patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients were on maintenance hemodialysis with 
insufficiently controlled SHPT (intact parathyroid hormone [PTH] >180 pg/mL) by 
conventional therapies. All subjects were initially administered 25 mg 
cinacalcet daily, with concomitant use of calcitriol analogs. Abdominal aortic 
calcification was annually evaluated by calculating aortic calcification area 
index (ACAI) using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), from 12 months 
before to 36 months after the initiation of cinacalcet therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were analyzed in this study. The mean age was 
59.0±8.7 years, 34.8% were women, and the mean dialysis duration was 163.0±76.0 
months. After administration of cinacalcet, serum levels of intact PTH, 
phosphorus, and calcium significantly decreased, and mean Ca × P values 
significantly decreased from 67.4±7.9 mg(2)/dL(2) to 52±7.7 mg(2)/dL(2). 
Although the ACAI value did not decrease during the observation period, the 
increase in ACAI between 24 months and 36 months after cinacalcet administration 
was significantly suppressed.
CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of cinacalcet was associated with reduced 
progression of abdominal aortic calcification, and achieving appropriate calcium 
and phosphorus levels may reduce the rates of cardiovascular events and 
mortality in patients on hemodialysis.

HYPOTHESES: There are factors that affect patients with general weakness owing 
to secondary hyperparathyroidism and as reported by results noted after 
parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation.
DESIGN: Case series and consecutive samples.
SETTING: Tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: From July 1996 to June 1998, 56 patients with secondary 
hyperparathyroidism underwent total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. 
Their ages were 45 +/- 13 years (mean +/- SD) and preoperative duration of 
dialysis was 75 +/- 37 months. Prior to surgery the patients were divided into 2 
groups: group A comprised 2 men and 19 women who had some general weakness; and 
group B, 15 men and 20 women who reported no general weakness. The etiologies of 
renal failure, such as diabetic nephropathy (n = 3) or hypertensive nephropathy 
(n = 3), were found only in group A patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and 
parathyroid hormone (intact) were checked preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, and 
3 months after surgery. Extension force of the quadriceps femoris muscle was 
measured at 60 degrees of right knee flexion preoperatively and 3 months after 
surgery. The extension force was expressed as newtons (N) in 2 different 
quantities: peak force and average force. The degree of general weakness was 
classified into 4 groups: 0, no weakness; 1, some subjective weakness and/or 
walking with assistance; 2, the patient was wheelchair bound; and 3, the patient 
was bedridden.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The t test was used for paired and unpaired data; 
Wilcoxon signed rank and Fisher exact tests were incorporated for nonparametric 
data. Any values of P<.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS: Prior to surgery, 2 patients in group A reported degree 3 weakness; 5, 
degree 2 weakness; and 14, degree 1 weakness. Three months after surgery, the 
peak force was noticed to have increased from 185 +/- 56 N to 249 +/- 82 N (mean 
+/- SD) (n = 11, P = .003), and the average force showed an increase from 136 
+/- 45 N to 202 +/- 69 N (n = 11, P = .003). Postoperatively, only 5 patients 
had degree 1 weakness, 1 had degree 2 weakness, and none had degree 3 weakness. 
The patient with degree 2 weakness after surgery had diabetes mellitus and a 
femoral neck fracture prior to parathyroidectomy. Improvement in condition of 
general weakness was found (P<.001) between preoperative and postoperative 
periods. Serum levels of calcium were higher in group A (2.82 +/- 0.23 mmol/L 
[11.3 +/- 0.9 mg/dL]) than in group B (2.64 +/- 0.27 mmol/L [10.6 +/- 1.1 
mg/dL]) (P = .013), and serum levels of parathyroid hormone (intact) were lower 
in group A (108.9 +/- 39.2 pmol/L) than in group B (139.8 +/- 39.6 pmol/L) (P = 
.006). Except for sex, other data such as phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase 
levels, age, and duration of dialysis were not significantly different between 
the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: General weakness that is commonly observed in patients with 
secondary hyperparathyroidism is found more frequently in women and only in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephropathy. Patients with 
general weakness had relatively higher levels of calcium and lower levels of 
parathyroid hormone (intact). We found that improvement of muscle power and 
general weakness can be achieved by parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. 
In addition to itchy skin, bone pain, and soft tissue calcification, general 
weakness that may cause disability is also an indication for surgery in 
secondary hyperparathyrodism.

Successful treatment of tumoral calcinosis using continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) combined with hemodialysis is described. A 
32-year-old male patient with a 2-year history of CAPD rapidly developed 
multiple metastatic calcification (tumoral calcinosis) adjacent to his fingers, 
elbows, and knee joints. Tests showed severe hyperphosphatemia, moderate 
hypercalcemia, and increased Ca-P product without elevation of intact 
parathyroid hormone. An enlarged parathyroid gland was not found by echography. 
In order to rapidly lower the excessive Ca and P levels, a combined therapy with 
CAPD and vigorous transient hemodialysis using a low-Ca dialysate was performed. 
In parallel, the patient was given calcitonin, bisphosphonate, and short-term Al 
to ameliorate the metastatic calcifications more effectively. The result was 
dramatic with disappearance of the tumoral calcinosis as well as improvement in 
subjective symptoms within a few months. The present case suggests that combined 
therapy with hemodialysis and CAPD using a low-Ca dialysate, together with 
Ca-modulating agents, can be effective in ameliorating tumoral calcinosis in 
patients on CAPD.
