TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification
      in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death
      from cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may
      play a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC
      prevalence in patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism
      (SHPT) and identify CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective
      analysis of the severe hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively 
      recruited patients on dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for
      parathyroidectomy, from October 2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density
      (BMD) were measured. Demographic and clinical data including calcium, phosphorus,
      alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1
      (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston
      units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. No CAC, 
      mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were
      observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of patients, respectively. DKK1 and
      sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In univariate analysis, CAC was
      significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total cholesterol, and intravenous
      pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely correlated with the BMD, T
      scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In multivariate analysis, the
      stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that CAC was associated with
      age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). Furthermore, serum
      sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral neck but
      negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum sclerostin 
      was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with Z-scores<-2.5 of
      the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid hormone,
      vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The
      patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

TI  - Impact of Abdominal Aortic Calcification on Central Haemodynamics and Decline of 
      Glomerular Filtration Rate in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and
      4.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000501687 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this
      population. The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic
      calcification volume (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) in a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS:
      Eighty-four patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective
      observational study. At study entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma
      51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was
      determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years
      and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal
      aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 patients (79%). A binary logistic
      regression analysis revealed that age was the only statistically significant
      independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male gender (B = 0.413, p =
      0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 0.001) and
      ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently associated with
      AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the presence nor the
      extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change in GFR during 
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, only
      age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not associated 
      with the rate of decline in GFR.

TI  - Association between Aortic Calcification, Cardiovascular Events, and Mortality in
      Kidney and Pancreas-Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 177-186
LID - 10.1159/000502328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney
      and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal
      aortic calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point 
      AAC (0-24) score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. METHODS: 
      Between the years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant
      recipients were scored for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV
      events (coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease),
      graft-loss, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 +/- 12 years
      (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: >/=8). After a
      median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 
      died, and 80 suffered graft loss. For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted 
      hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and
      1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar after adjusting for age, gender, smoking,
      transplant type, dialysis vintage, and diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 
      1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high versus no AAC, the unadjusted and
      fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for
      deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28)
      and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking history-adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION:
      Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and
      mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than recipients without AAC. AAC scoring
      may be useful in assessing and targeted risk-lowering strategies.

TI  - Risk of Abdominal Aortic Calcifications among End Stage Renal Disease Patients
      under Maintenance Haemodialysis.
PG  - 600-604
AB  - Calcification of soft tissue and blood vessel wall occurs more frequently in
      dialyzed patients. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the risk of
      abdominal aortic calcification among end stage renal disease patients under
      maintenance haemodialysis. This case-control study was carried out in the
      Department of Nephrology at National Institute of Kidney Diseases and Urology
      (NIKDU), Dhaka and National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and Hospital
      (NICVD), Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2013 to December 2014 for a period of two
      (02) years. Chronic kidney disease in stage 5 {CKD-5(D)} patients older than 18
      years on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) for more than 3 months were selected as 
      case group. And same age and sex non CKD patients were considered as control
      group. Serum calcium, serum albumin, serum phosphate and iPTH were estimated by
      semi-automated biochemistry analyzer from the Department of Biochemistry of
      NIKDU, Dhaka and NICVD, Dhaka. Plain X-ray abdomen in lateral view was performed 
      for all patients. Total 100 patients were enrolled for this study of which 50
      patients were in end stage renal disease (ESRD) group and the rest 50 patients
      were in non-CKD group. Abdominal aortic calcification on X ray was present in
      22(44%) patients of ESRD group and 6(12%) patients of non CKD group of
      population. Mean+/-SD serum calcium (corrected) level was significantly high
      (p<0.001) in ESRD patients (9.79+/-0.87) compared to non CKD group of population 
      (9.13+/-0.70). Mean+/-SD of serum phosphate level was significantly higher
      (p<0.001) in ESRD patients (5.71+/-0.96) compared to non CKD group of population 
      (4.20+/-0.59). However, mean+/-SD iPTH level showed no significant difference
      between ESRD (25.33+/-51.98) and non CKD group of population (38.53+/-19.52),
      though iPTH level remain below the target level in ESRD group. Abdominal aortic
      calcification is significantly higher among ESRD subjects.

TI  - Serum sclerostin levels are positively related to bone mineral density in
      peritoneal dialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 266
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1452-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor
      virus integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a
      potential contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder
      (MBD), which has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular
      calcification. The positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density
      (BMD) has been demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between
      sclerostin and BMD in PD patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were
      enrolled; their sera were collected for measurement of sclerostin and other
      CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also assessed simultaneously. We examined the
      relationship between sclerostin and each parameter through Spearman correlation
      analysis and by comparing group data between patients with above- and
      below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and multiple logistic regression
      models were employed to define the most predictive of sclerostin levels in the
      above-median category. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that sclerostin was
      correlated with spine BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score (r = 0.274, P
      = 0.010), spine BMD Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact parathyroid
      hormone (PTH; r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. High
      BMD, old age, male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high
      osteocalcin and uric acid levels were observed in patients with high serum
      sclerostin levels and an inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin.
      Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively
      correlated with above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P =
      0.002); the correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR =
      121.5, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a
      positive association between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD
      population.

TI  - Reduction in Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity Is Associated with a Short-Term Reduction
      in Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density T Score.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1159/000501392 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We
      wished to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with
      changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS:
      We measured vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and BMD by
      dual electron absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to compensate
      for differences in patient ages and gender. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had
      repeat aPWV measurements and DXA scans, median 12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased 
      in 15 and increased in 9. As there were more women in the group with an increase 
      in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted DXA T scores Total body T scores fell in both
      groups, but median T scores remained positive for those with an increase in aPWV,
      whereas negative T scores on both scans for those with a decrease in or stable
      aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in those with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to
      0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant decrease 
      in those with an increase in aPWV (-0.5 [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]).
      There were no changes in femoral neck T scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces
      the hypothesis of a link between bone disease and vascular disease in dialysis
      patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging of the aorta and will include aortic 
      calcification, and as such a reduction in lumbar spine T score without a change
      in femoral neck T score suggests a reduction in aortic calcification. Although
      our study requires additional confirmation, our data would suggest that changes
      in aPWV could be used as a surrogate for changes in vascular calcification in the
      investigation of interventions designed to reduce vascular calcification.

TI  - Chemerin inhibits vascular calcification through ChemR23 and is associated with
      lower coronary calcium in chronic kidney disease.
LID - 10.1111/joim.12940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemerin is an adipokine that signals through the G protein-coupled
      receptor ChemR23 and is associated with inflammation, glucose homeostasis, lipid 
      metabolism and renal function, all of which strongly influence cardiovascular
      risk. However, elevated chemerin provides a survival advantage in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), but how this relates to the cardiovascular
      phenotype is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to establish
      the association of chemerin with coronary calcification and to determine the
      effects of chemerin signalling, through ChemR23, in vascular smooth muscle cell
      (VSMC) calcification. METHODS: Plasma chemerin was measured in 113 patients with 
      CKD and 50 healthy controls. All patients underwent computed tomography to
      determine coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. VSMCs were isolated from wild-type
      and ChemR23 knock-out mice and treated with chemerin. RESULTS: Multivariate
      analyses established creatinine, cholesterol, body mass index and tumour necrosis
      factor as significant confounders for circulating chemerin levels. Despite these 
      positive associations with renal function, cardiometabolic risk factors and
      inflammation, chemerin was inversely associated with CAC both in an age- and
      sex-adjusted analysis and in a multivariate analysis adjusting for the
      aforementioned confounders. In addition, circulating chemerin levels were
      associated with the calcification inhibitors matrix gla protein (MGP) and
      fetuin-A. Finally, chemerin significantly reduced phosphate-induced calcification
      and increased MGP expression in VSMCs, whereas chemerin was devoid of these
      effects in VSMCs lacking ChemR23. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results
      suggest that chemerin signalling through ChemR23 in VSMCs protects against
      vascular calcification in CKD.

TI  - The association between liver fat and systemic calcified atherosclerosis.
LID - S0741-5214(19)31013-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2019.03.044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with
      systemic calcified atherosclerosis, other than the coronary arteries, has not
      been clearly elucidated. We investigated the association between NAFLD and
      calcification in eight different vascular beds. METHODS: In a community-based
      cohort with computed tomography scans for carotid artery, coronary artery,
      thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, iliac artery, renal artery, celiac trunk, and
      superior mesenteric artery, the association between NAFLD and arterial
      calcification was evaluated with adjustment for age, sex, hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, current smoking status, and family history of
      heart disease in the first-degree relatives. RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted
      models, NAFLD was significantly associated with calcification in the coronary
      artery, carotid artery, thoracic aorta, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric
      artery vascular beds (P < .05). However, adjustment for the traditional chronic
      venous disease risk factors attenuated the associations, except in the case of
      the thoracic aorta (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.09-1.78) and celiac trunk (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.16-3.65). In addition, NAFLD was
      independently associated with multiarterial calcification (four or more [OR,
      1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.74], five or more [OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97], and six or 
      more [OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.30] of eight evaluated arterial segments).
      CONCLUSIONS: The association between NAFLD and arterial calcification is mainly
      mediated by conventional risk factors. The independent association between NAFLD 
      and calcification in the thoracic aorta and celiac trunk as well as in a larger
      number of vascular beds needs confirmation in future prospective studies in
      diverse populations.

TI  - Serum osteoprotegerin is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness as
      assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients: a
      cross sectional study.
PG  - 184
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1374-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in
      patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an
      important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was
      conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and
      serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were
      collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity
      (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of
      > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels
      were analyzed categorically into tertiles. RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53
      (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values 
      of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <
      0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001).
      Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly associated with
      greater height (p = 0.011), male gender (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p =
      0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels.
      Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV value was
      independently associated with DM (beta = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles
      of serum OPG levels (beta = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3,
      respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic
      regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and
      high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for
      tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent
      predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels
      positively correlated with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r =
      0.408, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum 
      OPG levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high 
      serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial
      stiffening.

TI  - Kidney Function and Arterial Calcification in Major Vascular Beds.
PG  - e010930
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.010930 [doi]
AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between
      kidney function and arterial calcification in major vascular beds and to
      establish whether arterial calcification mediates the relation between kidney
      function measures and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence. Methods and
      Results In 2241 participants from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69 years, 52%
      female), kidney function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration
      rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. All participants underwent
      noncontrast computed tomography to quantify the amount of arterial calcification 
      in the coronary arteries, aortic arch, extracranial, and intracranial internal
      carotid arteries. We used linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and
      cardiovascular risk factors, to evaluate the association between kidney function 
      and arterial calcification volume in the 4 vessel beds. Incidence rate of CVD was
      calculated in 3 groups of participants based on their kidney function and
      presence of arterial calcification. We conducted mediation analysis to evaluate
      whether arterial calcification mediates this association. We found that in age-
      and sex-adjusted models, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio were associated with larger calcification volumes in 
      all 4 vascular beds. Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the
      effect estimates. CVD incidence was higher in participants with estimated
      glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and presence of arterial
      calcification compared with individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate
      >60 and no calcification. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors,
      arterial calcification did not mediate the association between kidney function
      measures and CVD incidence. Conclusions The association of impaired kidney
      function and larger volumes of arterial calcification is partly explained by
      cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial calcification does not mediate the
      association between kidney function and CVD beyond cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - The effectiveness of cinacalcet: a randomized, open label study in chronic
      hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 326-333
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1562356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high
      incidences of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study
      was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic
      kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis
      patients with severe SHPT. METHODS: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were
      randomized to cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the
      achievement of >30% reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated 
      to further explore the effect of cinacalcet on CKD-MBD parameters for 24-week
      follow up and 12 additional weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation. RESULTS: In
      phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639)
      pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], 
      the percentage of patients achieving iPTH target were significantly higher in the
      treatment group [80% vs. 13%, p = .001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions
      of iPTH, FGF-23, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased
      size of parathyroid gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 
      24-week follow up and markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet.
      CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated
      even in chronic HD patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of
      bone markers and FGF-23, and stabilization of vascular calcification were
      observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe
      SHPT and might be an initially effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical
      parathyroidectomy as well as an alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable 
      for surgery. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02056730. Date
      of registration: February 4, 2014.

TI  - Plasma Complement Protein C3a Level Was Associated with Abdominal Aortic
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.
LID - 10.1007/s12265-019-09885-2 [doi]
AB  - The complement system plays an important role in cardiovascular disease in
      patients on hemodialysis. Vascular calcification is also one of the major causes 
      of cardiovascular disease. We want to investigate the relationship between
      complement activation and vascular calcification in dialyzed patients. One
      hundred eight hemodialysis patients and 65 heathy controls were enrolled
      prospectively. Plasma C3a, C5a, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and membrane attack
      complex (MAC or C5b-9) levels were detected using ELISA. Plasma C3c, fB, fH, C1q,
      and C4 levels were measured by immunity transmission turbidity. Abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) was measured by abdomen lateral plain radiograph, and the AAC
      score was calculated. We identified increased level of MBL and decreased level of
      C3c and complement factor B compared with normal control. However, C1q,
      complement factor H, and C4 levels remained at a similar level compared with
      individuals with normal renal function. The C3a and C5a levels increased, without
      change of MAC. Forty two of 108 HD patients had the AAC score. C3a levels were
      correlated with AAC score (r = 0.461, p = 0.002). The median C3a concentration
      was 238.72 (196.96, 323.41) ng/mL. When evaluated as AAC categories (</= 4, > 5) 
      with ordinal logistic regression, univariate analyses revealed that higher C3a
      levels were associated with severe AAC, while multivariate analyses adjusted for 
      age, sex, and calcium level showed that higher C3a levels (OR, 6.28 (1.25-31.69);
      p = 0.03) were associated with severe AAC. The areas under the curve (AUC) for
      C3a to diagnose severe abdominal aortic calcification were 0.75(0.58-0.92, 0.01).
      The complement system was activated in patients on hemodialysis. Higher C3a
      levels are independently associated with severe AAC. Plasma C3a might have a
      diagnostic value for the severe AAC in HD patients.

PG  - 134-144
LID - 10.2478/jomb-2018-0026 [doi]
AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in dialysis (HD)
      patients, and its mechanism is multifactorial. Most likely that systemic or local
      inhibitory factor is overwhelmed by promoters of VC in these patients. VC
      increased arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the present
      study aimed to investigate the association of VC and myocardial remodeling and to
      analyze their relationship with VC promoters (fibroblast growth factor 23-FGF23, 
      Klotho, intact parathormon-iPTH, vitamin D) in 56 prevalent HD patients (median
      values: age 54 yrs, HD vintage 82 months). Methods: Besides routine laboratory
      analyzes, serum levels of FGF 23, soluble Klotho, iPTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3;
      pulse wave velocity (PWV); left ventricular (LV) mass by ultrasound; and VCs
      score by Adragao method were measured. Results: VC was found in 60% and LV
      concentric or eccentric hypertrophy in 50% patients. Dialysis vintage (OR 1.025, 
      95%CI 1.007-1.044, p=0.006) FGF23 (OR 1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.012, p=0.029) and
      serum magnesium (OR 0.000, 95%CI 0.000-0.214, p=0.04) were associated with VC.
      Changes in myocardial geometry was associated with male sex (beta=-0.273, 95% CI 
      -23.967 1.513, p=0.027), iPTH (beta 0.029, 95%CI -0.059-0.001, p=0.027) and
      vitamin D treatment (beta 25.49, 95%CI 11.325-39.667, p=0.001). Also, patients
      with the more widespread VC had the highest LV remodeling categories. PWV was
      associated patient's age, cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, LV mass
      (positively) and serum calcium (negatively), indicating potential link with
      atherosclerotic risk. Conclusions: Despite to different risk factors for VC and
      myocardial remodeling, obtained results could indicate that risk factors
      intertwine in long-term treatment of HD patients and therefore careful and
      continuous correction of mineral metabolism disorders is undoubtedly of the
      utmost importance.

PG  - 327-335
LID - 10.3906/sag-1809-43 [doi]
AB  - Background/aim: Fetuin-A, a circulating inhibitor of calcification, is a marker
      of inflammatory-nutritional state. We evaluated the association between serum
      fetuin-A levels and vascular calcification, intima-media thickness, and
      nutritional and inflammatory markers in different stages of chronic kidney
      disease (CKD). Materials and methods: CKD patients were sampled for
      calcium-phosphate parameters and nutritional and inflammatory markers [highly
      sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)], and serum fetuin-A levels. Intima-media
      thicknesses of the common carotid arteries (CIMT) were measured. Peripheral
      artery calcification scores were obtained. Results: A total of 238 patients were 
      included in the study. Fetuin-A levels in patients with end-stage renal disease
      were significantly lower than those in patients with stage-3 and stage-4 CKD
      (stage-5 vs. stage-4, P < 0.001; stage-5 vs. stage-3, P < 0.001). Fetuin-A was
      negatively correlated with creatinine (P < 0.001), Ca x P product (P < 0.001),
      hs-CRP (P = 0.01), vascular calcification score (P < 0.001), and CIMT (P <
      0.001), and positively correlated with BMI (P < 0.001, r = 0.30) and serum
      albumin (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Lower levels of fetuin-A were associated with
      higher vascular calcification scores, CIMT, hs-CRP levels, and lower BMI and
      albumin. Fetuin-A deficiency may be a key element for MIAC syndrome.

TI  - Potential Role of H-Ferritin in Mitigating Valvular Mineralization.
PG  - 413-431
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.118.312191 [doi]
AB  - Objective- Calcific aortic valve disease is a prominent finding in elderly and in
      patients with chronic kidney disease. We investigated the potential role of iron 
      metabolism in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease. Approach and
      Results- Cultured valvular interstitial cells of stenotic aortic valve with
      calcification from patients undergoing valve replacement exhibited significant
      susceptibility to mineralization/osteoblastic transdifferentiation in response to
      phosphate. This process was abrogated by iron via induction of H-ferritin as
      reflected by lowering ALP and osteocalcin secretion and preventing extracellular 
      calcium deposition. Cellular phosphate uptake and accumulation of lysosomal
      phosphate were decreased. Accordingly, expression of phosphate transporters Pit1 
      and Pit2 were repressed. Translocation of ferritin into lysosomes occurred with
      high phosphate-binding capacity. Importantly, ferritin reduced nuclear
      accumulation of RUNX2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2), and as a reciprocal 
      effect, it enhanced nuclear localization of transcription factor Sox9 (SRY
      [sex-determining region Y]-box 9). Pyrophosphate generation was also increased
      via upregulation of ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-2).
      (3)H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione mimicked these beneficial effects in valvular
      interstitial cell via induction of H-ferritin. Ferroxidase activity of H-ferritin
      was essential for this function, as ceruloplasmin exhibited similar inhibitory
      functions. Histological analysis of stenotic aortic valve revealed high
      expression of H-ferritin without iron accumulation and its relative dominance
      over ALP in noncalcified regions. Increased expression of H-ferritin accompanied 
      by elevation of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and IL-1beta
      (interleukin-1beta) levels, inducers of H-ferritin, corroborates the essential
      role of ferritin/ferroxidase via attenuating inflammation in calcific aortic
      valve disease. Conclusions- Our results indicate that H-ferritin is a stratagem
      in mitigating valvular mineralization/osteoblastic differentiation. Utilization
      of 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione to induce ferritin expression may prove a novel
      therapeutic potential in valvular mineralization.

TI  - Influence of intraoperative findings on immediate flow through radial-cephalic
      arteriovenous wrist fistulas for hemodialysis access.
PG  - 208-214
LID - 10.1590/1677-5449.001518 [doi]
AB  - Background: Adequate flow through a newly created arteriovenous fistula depends
      on multiple characteristics of the vessels and patient comorbidities. Several
      studies have related preoperative findings to failure, but few have analyzed the 
      influence of intraoperative findings. Objectives: To evaluate the predictive
      value of intraoperative findings on the immediate outcome of radial-cephalic
      arteriovenous wrist fistulas (RCAVF) by collecting data that are easily measured 
      intraoperatively. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study, in which a single
      surgeon performed 101 RCAVF in 100 patients at a single center. We analyzed the
      immediate postoperative flow, assessed by thrill intensity immediately after
      fistula creation, against patient demographics and intraoperative data. The
      following variables were analyzed: age, sex, comorbidities, length of vein
      visible at preoperative examination, macroscopic arterial calcification, maximum 
      vein diameter, and length of stenosis-free vein, measured by cannulation with a
      urethral catheter during the procedure. The chi-square test was used both to
      eliminate possible bias introduced by side of venous access (left or right), and 
      to determine predictive values of immediate thrill. Results: Side of access was
      not associated with any significant differences in variables. Absence of
      macroscopic arterial calcification, successful venous catheterization using a 6
      French catheter or larger, and ability to advance it more than 10 centimeters
      along the lumen of the proximal vein were correlated with adequate immediate
      postoperative thrill (p = 0.004, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005, respectively).
      Conclusions: In this series of 101 RCAVF, both the diameter of the catheter and
      its progress through the proximal vein and also absence of arterial calcification
      had positive predictive value for achieving adequate immediate thrill after
      vascular access construction.

TI  - The Correlation of Serum Osteoprotegerin with Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk
      Factors and Arterial Stiffness in Patients with Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney
      Disease: Results from the KNOW-CKD Study.
PG  - e322
LID - 10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e322 [doi]
AB  - Background: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays protective roles against the development 
      of vascular calcification (VC) which greatly contributes to the increased
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present 
      study aimed to find the non-traditional, kidney-related cardiovascular risk
      factors correlated to serum OPG and the effect of serum OPG on the arterial
      stiffness measured by brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in patients with
      the pre-dialysis CKD. Methods: We cross-sectionally analyzed the data from the
      patients in whom baPWV and the serum OPG were measured at the time of enrollment 
      in a prospective pre-dialysis CKD cohort study in Korea. Results: Along with
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, pulse
      pressure, and baPWV, non-traditional, kidney-related factors such as albuminuria,
      plasma level of hemoglobin, total CO2 content, alkaline phosphatase, and
      corrected calcium were independent variables for serum OPG in multivariate linear
      regression. Reciprocally, the serum OPG was positively associated with baPWV in
      multivariate linear regression. The baPWV in the 3rd and 4th quartile groups of
      serum OPG were higher than that in the 1st quartile group after adjustments by
      age, sex and other significant factors for baPWV in linear mixed model.
      Conclusion: Non-traditional, kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors in
      addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors were related to serum level
      of OPG in CKD. Serum OPG level was significantly related to baPWV. Our study
      suggests that kidney-related factors involved in CKD-specific pathways for VC
      play a role in the increased secretion of OPG into circulation in patients with
      CKD. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01630486.

TI  - Surgical outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection in dialysis patients.
PG  - 501-509
LID - 10.1007/s11748-018-1051-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is relatively uncommon in
      dialysis patients, and characteristics and repair outcomes are not fully
      understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ATAAD (n = 960) were divided into
      a dialysis group (n = 19) and non-dialysis group (n = 941), depending on whether 
      they required dialysis for preoperative end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hospital 
      charts and imaging data were reviewed, and characteristics and outcomes were
      compared between the groups. Segmental aortic wall or intima/media flap
      calcification in the thoracic and abdominal aorta was assessed in the dialysis
      patients. RESULTS: The leading primary causes of ESRD were polycystic kidney
      disease (n = 5) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5). There were no significant
      differences (dialysis group vs. non-dialysis group) in age (60.5 vs. 64.5 years),
      preoperative hemodynamics, or organ ischemia. Dialysis patients were more likely 
      to have an entry tear in the aortic arch (42% vs. 15%, p = 0.003). These patients
      showed moderate-to-severe calcification (multiple focal or single focal
      calcification > 10 mm) in the ascending aorta (17%), aortic arch (61%),
      descending aorta (67%), and abdominal aorta (83%). Arch replacement was common in
      this group (37% vs. 18%, p = 0.030). Although in-hospital mortality was increased
      in this group (21% vs. 7%, p = 0.059), morbidities did not differ significantly. 
      Six-year survival was 60.3 +/- 13.4% and 78.8 +/- 1.6%, respectively (p = 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis patients tend to have aortic calcification and a primary
      tear in the aortic arch. Outcomes are acceptable.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Predicts Less Coronary Artery Calcification and Diabetic Kidney 
      Disease Over 12 Years in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The CACTI Study.
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.2337/dc18-1527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery
      calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic kidney
      disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between serum
      uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal
      protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during
      2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 +/- 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes 
      of 24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease
      Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and
      after a mean follow-up period of 12.1 +/- 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion
      was defined as ACR >/=30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year), and 
      impaired GFR as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SUMOD was measured on stored baseline 
      plasma samples (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam
      computed tomography. CAC progression was defined as a change in the square
      root-transformed CAC volume of >/=2.5. RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level
      conferred lower odds of CAC progression (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97),
      incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56;
      0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 0.24-0.83) per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 
      ng/mL) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, systolic blood pressure, LDL
      cholesterol, and albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD to models with
      traditional risk factors also significantly improved the prediction performance
      for CAC progression and incident DKD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD level
      predicted lower odds of both CAC progression and incident DKD over 12 years in
      adults with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Progression of Medial Arterial Calcification in CKD.
PG  - 1328-1335
LID - 10.1016/j.ekir.2018.07.011 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Medial arterial calcification is common in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and portends poor clinical outcomes, but its progression relative to the
      severity of CKD and the role of other risk factors is unknown because of the lack
      of reliable quantification. Methods: Calcification of breast arteries detected by
      mammography, which is exclusively medial and correlates with medial calcification
      in peripheral arteries and with cardiovascular outcomes, was used to measure the 
      progression of medial arterial calcification in women with CKD and end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Measurements showed intra- and interobserver correlations
      of 0.98, an interstudy variability of 8% to 11%, and a correlation with computed 
      tomographic measurements of 0.92. Results: Progression of calcification was
      measured in 60 control subjects (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >/= 
      90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and 137 subjects with CKD (eGFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73
      m(2)). Progression in control subjects was linear over time and independent of
      age. The rate of progression was increased in CKD but only at eGFR < 40 ml/min
      per 1.73 m(2) (median, 8.1 vs. 3.9 mm/breast/yr in controls; P = 0.006).
      Progression accelerated markedly in subjects with ESRD (median, 20 mm/breast/yr; 
      n = 36), but did not differ from controls after kidney transplantation (n = 25). 
      Diabetes significantly augmented progression in subjects with CKD and ESRD but
      not in controls. Conclusion: Mammography is a convenient and reliable method to
      measure the progression of medial arterial calcification. Progression does not
      increase until advanced stages of CKD, accelerates markedly in ESRD, and returns 
      to control rates after kidney transplantation. Diabetes significantly increases
      progression in CKD and ESRD.

TI  - Comparison of atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with end

      PET/CT.
PG  - 169-174

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to increased 
      morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The primary underlying
      mechanism has been suggested as accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients.
      Our aim was to compare the atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in
      subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing
      fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forthy two subjects who
      underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively studied. Twenty one were 
      subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis (67+/-11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 
      were age- and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum 
      (SUVmax) and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, descending,
      abdominal) and for the common iliac arteries and common femoral arteries were
      measured. Standardized uptake value maximum and SUVmean for right atrial blood
      pool were also measured as the background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean,
      average SUVmax/background ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were
      compared between subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of
      macroscopic calcification on CT images for each arterial segment based on visual 
      qualitative assessment was also noted and compared. For statistical analysis,
      two-sided t-test was used for continuous variables, and chi-square test was used 
      for categorical variables. We considered a P value of <0.05 as statistically
      significant. RESULTS: Average SUVmax and SUVmean were statistically significantly
      greater in subjects with ESRD than in controls in all arterial segments. Average 
      SUVmax/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects
      with ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the
      left femoral artery. Average SUVmean/background ratios were statistically
      significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls in all
      arterial segments except for the right and left femoral arteries. Presence of
      calcification on CT was more frequently encountered in all arterial segments in
      subjects with ESRD, and was statistically significantly greater for the aortic
      arch, descending aorta, and right and left femoral arteries. CONCLUSION: SUV
      measurements representing the atherosclerotic inflammatory changes and
      macroscopic atherosclerotic calcifications appear to be accelerated in subjects
      with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to normal controls. Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is 
      a valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying accelerated
      atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.

PG  - 1554-1562
LID - 10.1159/000494441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and
      analyzed the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers
      and AoAC. METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using
      chest-X ray examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum
      levels of biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients
      (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score >/= 4 were older, with a higher
      percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum levels of albumin and
      triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely associated with AoAC severity,
      and FGF-23was directly related to vascular calcification. Age, gender, and
      dialysis vintage were independent predictors of AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients
      have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was dependent on older age in
      association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of circulating FGF-23 but not
      sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 levels were independently 
      associated with AoAC.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of Atherectomy Prior to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A
      Comparative Assessment of Atherectomy in Patients With Obesity (COAP-PCI
      Subanalysis).
PG  - 465-470
LID - JIC20181015-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      atherectomy devices in obese patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC).
      BACKGROUND: Atherectomy is an important tool for lesion preparation in patients
      with CAC undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There have been no 
      studies that compared the outcomes of orbital atherectomy (OA) and rotational
      atherectomy (RA) in obese patients. METHODS: A total of 35,590 patients from five
      tertiary-care hospitals who underwent PCI between January 2011 to April 2016 were
      identified. All adult patients with body mass index >/=30 kg/ m2 who had OA or RA
      prior to PCI were included in this analysis. A total of 91 patients were included
      in the OA arm and 131 patients in the RA arm prior to the matching. To remove
      potential selection bias, a propensity-score matched analysis was performed, and 
      69 patients were included in each group. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, composite
      of safety outcomes, did not occur in any patient of either group. The secondary
      endpoints - death on discharge (0.0% vs 1.5%; P=.48) and myocardial infarction
      (2.9% vs 6.4%; P=.42) - were similar between groups, as were individual outcomes 
      including cardiogenic shock, bleeding complications, and congestive heart
      failure. Stroke, vascular complications, and the requirement for dialysis
      initiation did not occur in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: In this study
      assessing atherectomy in obese patients, OA and RA demonstrated comparable
      outcomes with complication rates within an acceptable range. It demonstrates that
      OA and RA can be safely performed in this high-risk patient subset with CAC.

TI  - Relationships between abdominal aortic calcification, glomerular filtration rate,
      and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic
      kidney disease.
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.5414/CN109441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an established risk factor
      for cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We
      hypothesized that AAC is associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate 
      (GFR) as well as with some other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized
      controlled clinical trial (RENEXC). A total of 151 patients (aged 66 +/- 14
      years) with an average measured GFR (mGFR) of 22.5 +/- 8.2 mL/min/1.73m2, not on 
      renal replacement therapy, irrespective of number of comorbidities, were
      included. GFR was measured with iohexol clearance and estimated using cystatin C-
      and creatinine-based equations (eGFR). AAC was evaluated with lateral lumbar
      X-ray using the scoring system described by Kauppila. All patients underwent
      laboratory analyses, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and standard
      echocardiography. Multiple linear regression analyses controlling for sex, age,
      cardiovascular comorbidities, and hypertension were performed. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of AAC in this group of patients was 73%, and 47% had severe
      calcification (AAC score >/= 7). More men (76%) had AAC than women (69%). AAC
      score was associated with mGFR (p = 0.03), eGFR (p = 0.006), plasma albumin (p = 
      0.006), plasma phosphate (p = 0.01), pulse pressure (p = 0.004), left ventricular
      mass (LVM) (p = 0.02), left atrial volume (LAV; p < 0.001), and left atrial
      volume index (LAVI; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: AAC was highly prevalent in CKD. The 
      degree of calcification in the abdominal aorta was strongly associated with a
      decline in GFR, a decrease in plasma albumin, an increase in plasma phosphate, an
      increase in pulse pressure, and cardiac structural changes, such as an increase
      in LVM, LAV, and LAVI..

TI  - In-Hospital Outcomes of Chronic Total Occlusion Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - E113-E121
LID - JIC2018915-3 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on in-hospital outcomes of
      chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has
      received limited study. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of CKD and its
      impact on CTO-PCI outcomes in 1979 patients who underwent 2040 procedures between
      2012 and 2017 at 18 centers. CKD was defined as preprocedural estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). RESULTS: Compared with
      patients without CKD (n = 1444; 73%), patients with CKD (n = 535; 27%) had more
      comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral
      arterial disease, prior myocardial infarction, PCI, coronary artery bypass graft 
      surgery, and stroke), and more severe calcification and proximal vessel
      tortuosity. Patients with and without CKD had similar technical success rates
      (84% vs 86%; P=.49) and procedural success rates (83% vs 84%; P=.44). Patients
      with CKD had higher in-hospital mortality rate (1.9% vs 0.3%; P<.001) and
      in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate (4.3% vs 2.2%; P<.01).
      In-hospital mortality and MACE rates increased with decreasing eGFR levels
      (P=.03). In multivariate analysis, an independent association was observed
      between CKD and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odd ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.2-16.0; P=.02), but not overall MACE (adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.8-2.7; P=.28). CONCLUSIONS: CKD is common among patients
      undergoing CTO-PCI. High success rates can be achieved in patients with decreased
      glomerular filtration rate, but CKD may be associated with higher in-hospital
      mortality.

TI  - Vascular Calcification in Chronic Kidney Disease: The Role of Inflammation.
PG  - 4310379
LID - 10.1155/2018/4310379 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular complications are extremely frequent in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and death from cardiac causes is the most common cause of
      death in this particular population. Cardiovascular disease is approximately 3
      times more frequent in patients with CKD than in other known cardiovascular risk 
      groups and cardiovascular mortality is approximately 10-fold more frequent in
      patients on dialysis compared to the age- and sex-matched segments of the
      nonrenal population. Among other structural and functional factors advanced
      calcification of atherosclerotic plaques as well as of the arterial and venous
      media has been described as potentially relevant for this high cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. One potential explanation for this exceedingly high
      vascular calcification in animal models as well as in patients with CKD increased
      systemic and most importantly local (micro)inflammation that has been shown to
      favor the development of calcifying particles by multiple ways. Of note, local
      vascular upregulation of proinflammatory and proosteogenic molecules is already
      present at early stages of CKD and may thus be operative for vascular
      calcification. In addition, increased expression of costimulatory molecules and
      mast cells has also been documented in patients with CKD pointing to a more
      inflammatory and potentially less stable phenotype of coronary atherosclerotic
      plaques in CKD.

TI  - The role of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use in vitamin K status.
PG  - e0203157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203157 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage
      renal disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney
      transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular
      calcification. Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by
      vitamin-K-dependent matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether
      kidney transplantation or phosphate binders affect vitamin K status is unknown.
      Therefore, we studied the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate
      binder use on vitamin K status. METHODS: We measured plasma
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low vitamin K
      status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82),
      peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n
      = 36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear
      regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate
      binder use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential
      confounders. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52+/-13 years; 102 (68%) were
      male. Dp-ucMGP levels were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients
      (median 689 pmol/L) compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L,
      p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any
      phosphate binder was not associated with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p =
      0.09) compared to no phosphate binders (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients 
      used sevelamer monotherapy, which was associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels
      (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K
      antagonist use. CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney transplantation is associated with
      lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin K status after transplantation.
      Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels suggesting
      worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more attention to vitamin K 
      status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for protection against 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Fetuin-A: Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease
      in Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1159/000491025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "T50," shortened transformation time from primary to secondary
      calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein
      fetuin-A is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid For Vascular Outcome
      Prevention In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic
      controlled clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients 
      (KTRs). We conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly
      selected subcohort of patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum
      T50 and fetuin-A were determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial
      participants at randomization. RESULTS: During a median surveillance of
      2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) 
      or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were associated with CVD after
      adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood pressure, age, sex, race,
      preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol/HDL
      cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin inhibitor, or
      lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urinary
      albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, T50,
      (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI
      1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect
      modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as
      reduced fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained
      associated with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD
      risk factors, measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical
      characteristics and demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term
      KTRs. Increased hsCRP was an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations.

TI  - Elevated Circulating Osteoprotegerin Levels in the Plasma of Hemodialyzed
      Patients With Severe Artery Calcification.
PG  - 519-529
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12681 [doi]
AB  - We studied the correlations between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level and
      radial artery calcification (RAC) assessed histologically and carotid artery
      intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). Moreover, we studied the relationship between
      OPG levels and all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality during a 5-year
      observation period. The study comprised 59 CKD patients (36 hemodialyzed (HD), 23
      predialysis). The biochemical parameters included: creatinine, calcium,
      phosphate, intact parathormone, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
      factor receptor II (TNFRII), transforming growth factor-beta, hepatocyte growth
      factor, fibroblast growth factor 23, osteonectin (ON), osteopontin,
      osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin. CCA-IMT and the presence of atherosclerotic
      plaques was assessed by ultrasound. Fragments of radial artery obtained during
      creation of HD access were prepared for microscopy and stained for calcifications
      with alizarin red. RAC was detected in 34 patients (58%). In multiple regression 
      adjusted for dialysis status, TNFRII, ON and Framingham risk score (FRS) were
      identified as the independent predictors of OPG. Serum OPG above the median value
      of 7.55 pmol/L significantly predicted the presence of RAC in simple logistic
      regression (OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.39-20.4; P = 0.012) and in multiple logistic
      regression adjusted for FRS, dialysis status and CCA-IMT values (OR 6.56; 95%CI
      1.06-40.6; P = 0.036). OPG levels above the median were associated with higher
      CCA-IMT values (1.02 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.13; P < 0.001) and predicted the
      presence of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery (OR 14.4; 95%CI 2.84-72.9; 
      P < 0.001), independently of FRS, dialysis status and RAC. In this study,
      elevated serum OPG levels correlated with higher CCA-IMT, the presence of
      atherosclerotic plaques and the severity of the RAC independently of each other. 
      During follow-up, 25 patients (42%) died, including 21 due to CV causes. In
      multiple Cox regression, OPG above the median predicted overall survival
      independently of dialysis status, Framingham risk score, CCA-IMT above the median
      value, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in CCA, but not independently 
      of RAC. We postulate that circulating OPG may play a dual role as a marker for
      both medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis, hence it seems to be a
      valuable tool for assessing CV risk in patients with CKD. OPG might be an early
      indicator of all-cause mortality in CKD patients with advanced medial arterial
      calcification.

TI  - Differential Impact of Chronic Kidney Disease on Coronary Calcification and
      Atherosclerosis in Asymptomatic Individuals with or without Diabetes: Analysis
      from a Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Registry.
PG  - 228-236
LID - 10.1159/000489097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the combined effects of chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and diabetes on the extent and developmental pattern of coronary
      artery disease (CAD). METHODS: A total of 3,017 self-referred asymptomatic
      individuals without known CAD who underwent 64-channel dual-source coronary
      computed tomography angiography between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled. The patients
      were divided into six groups based on their diabetes status (nondiabetic or
      diabetic) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 
      m2, normal renal function; eGFR 60-89, mild CKD; or eGFR 30-59, moderate CKD). We
      compared the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), segment stenosis score (SSS), 
      and >/=50% obstructive CAD among the groups. RESULTS: In nondiabetics, whereas
      SSS and >/=50% obstructive CAD were not different as renal function deteriorated,
      after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, CACS showed a unique
      developmental pattern: no CACS increase until mild CKD, but abrupt increase from 
      the stage of moderate CKD (moderate vs. normal renal function, adjusted OR 5.118,
      95% CI 1.293-20.262, p = 0.020). In diabetics, patients from the stage of mild
      CKD were more likely to have >/=50% obstructive CAD (p = 0.004), higher CACS (p =
      0.020), and SSS (p = 0.001) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence 
      of CKD did not have a significant impact on the development of coronary
      atherosclerosis, but affected the progression of coronary calcification more
      markedly from the stage of moderate CKD in nondiabetics. However, in diabetics,
      the deterioration of renal function was significantly associated with the
      development of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification from the stage of mild 
      CKD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and associated 
      factors of carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 309 panoramic
      radiographs of patients with CKD (180 men and 129 women; mean age 43.7 years)
      undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated by a single radiologist to determine the
      frequency of CAC. An analysis of associated factors, such as age, sex, time spent
      in hemodialysis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, biochemical
      parameters, and other systemic diseases, was also performed. RESULTS: The
      presence of CAC in patients with CKD, as determined on the basis of panoramic
      radiography, was 15.9%. The chi(2) test revealed that there was a statistically
      significant association between certain factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes
      mellitus, and the presence of CAC (P < .05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated
      that time spent in hemodialysis was significantly associated with the occurrence 
      of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant presence of CAC was detected on digital
      panoramic radiographs in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis. Calcification
      was more frequent in older patients, women, individuals with diabetes mellitus,
      and patients who had undergone hemodialysis for longer periods.

TI  - Two years of maintenance hemodialysis has a pronounced effect on arterial
      stiffness progression.
PG  - 193-199
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-0971-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The change of aortic stiffness, but not the particular baseline
      value, plays a crucial role in estimating the patient risk with end-stage renal
      disease. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the evolution of central and peripheral
      arterial stiffness in hemodialysis population without previous cardiovascular
      events during a 2-year follow-up. METHODS: 60 hemodialysis patients (mean age
      57.61 +/- 13.01 years) were prospectively interviewed, and they underwent blood
      tests, chest X-ray for aortic calcification evaluation and pulse wave velocity
      (PWV) measurements at the baseline, after 6 months and after 2 years of
      observation period. RESULTS: We found significant progression of aortic PWV
      (12.73 vs. 14.24 m/s, p = 0.032) and regression of brachial PWV (11.53 vs. 8.85
      m/s, p < 0.001). CRP increase influenced evolution of aortic PWV (beta = 0.331, p
      = 0.031, R(2) = 0.599). Higher beta2-microglobulin values was related to the
      progression of aortic PWV (beta = 0.219, p = 0.022, R(2) = 0.568). Mean arterial 
      blood pressure had influence only on the short-term arterial stiffness evolution.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis experience pronounced changes
      of arterial stiffness during the 2-year follow-up period. The progression of
      aortic stiffness is related to inflammatory response and particularly is
      influenced by beta2-microglobulin concentration and aortic calcification.

TI  - Longitudinal changes in bone and mineral metabolism after cessation of cinacalcet
      in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s12882-018-0910-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to
      reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess
      effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis 
      patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles
      (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated
      with increased vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.
      METHODS: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between
      August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study.
      Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12
      months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an age- and
      gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naive dialysis patients. RESULTS: Sixty-two
      patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6 +/- 13.2 years. Biochemical
      changes over 12 months following cessation of cinacalcet included an increase in 
      serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8
      [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium (2.31 +/- 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 +/-
      0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were
      associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin 
      (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month
      period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular events, one episode of
      calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality rate of 19% (n = 13). 
      CONCLUSION: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real
      world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and CPP subsets, 
      novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION:: Several histologic features have been identified in the
      upper-extremity arteries and veins of patients with advanced chronic kidney
      disease, which may affect arteriovenous fistula maturation. However, it is
      unclear whether these chronic kidney disease vascular features are abnormal.
      METHODS:: We obtained upper-extremity arterial and venous specimens from 125
      advanced chronic kidney disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula
      creation and from 15 control subjects. We quantified medial fibrosis,
      micro-calcification, and intimal hyperplasia with appropriate histology stains.
      We characterized medial collagen fiber configuration in
      second-harmonic-generation microscopy images for the fiber anisotropy index and
      the dominant fiber direction. RESULTS:: The advanced chronic kidney disease
      patients were significantly younger than control subjects (53 +/- 14 years vs 76 
      +/- 11 years, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, the chronic kidney disease
      patients had greater arterial medial fibrosis (69% +/- 14% vs 51% +/- 10%, p <
      0.001) and greater arterial micro-calcification (3.03% +/- 5.17% vs 0.01% +/-
      0.03%, p = 0.02), but less arterial intimal thickness (30 +/- 25 microm vs 63 +/-
      25 microm, p < 0.001), as compared to control subjects. The anisotropy index of
      medial collagen fibers was lower in both arteries (0.24 +/- 0.10 vs 0.44 +/-
      0.04, p < 0.001) and veins (0.28 +/- 0.09 vs 0.53 +/- 0.10, p < 0.001) in chronic
      kidney disease patients, indicating that orientation of the fibers was more
      disordered. The dominant direction of medial collagen fibers in chronic kidney
      disease patients was greater in the arteries (49.3 degrees +/- 23.6 degrees vs
      4.0 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees , p < 0.001) and the veins (30.0 degrees +/- 19.6
      degrees vs 3.9 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees , p < 0.001), indicating that the fibers
      in general were aligned more perpendicular to the lumen. CONCLUSION:: Advanced
      chronic kidney disease is associated with several abnormalities in vascular
      histology and collagen fiber configuration. Future research is needed to
      investigate whether these abnormalities affect the maturation outcomes of
      arteriovenous fistulas.

AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular
      calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and
      cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance 
      HD patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest
      radiographs were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 
      100 patients (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with
      those without VC (70% vs. 50.2%, P=0.001). VC was independently associated with a
      2.42-fold increased risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis,
      compared with patients with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was
      independently associated with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or
      LVH alone was not. Patients with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a
      composite event of deaths or CVE (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant
      synergistic interaction was observed between VC and LVH (P for
      interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently associated with LVH. The
      coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk of deaths and CVEs than
      either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic interaction for the risk of 
      deaths and CVEs.

TI  - Potential Correlation Between Circulating Fetuin-A and Pentraxin-3 With
      Biochemical Parameters of Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 752-755
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and
      cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
      patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular
      calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation,
      which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this
      study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some
      biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients.
      METHODS: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age,
      gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from
      all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca),
      phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, 
      fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by
      biochemical methods. RESULTS: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive 
      protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were
      significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and 
      albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a
      significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of
      dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was
      significant only in the patient group. CONCLUSION: In this study, increased PTX3 
      and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. According to our 
      results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for
      inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla Protein, Arterial Stiffness, and Endothelial Function in
      African American Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 735-741
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vascular calcification inhibitor
      dependent upon vitamin K for activation. Evidence suggests that elevated plasma
      inactive MGP levels (desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP, dp-ucMGP; indicating poorer
      vascular vitamin K status) are associated with greater cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk. Despite African Americans experiencing highest rates of kidney
      failure and CVD events, relationships between dp-ucMGP and CVD risk markers have 
      not been examined in this population. We investigated vascular vitamin K status
      (via plasma dp-ucMGP) between African American hemodialysis (HD) patients and
      healthy controls, and the associations of dp-ucMGP with arterial stiffness and
      endothelial function in HD patients only. METHODS: In 37 African American HD
      patients and 37 age- and race-matched controls, plasma dp-ucMGP was measured by
      enzyme immunoassay as a marker of vascular vitamin K status. Carotid-femoral
      pulse wave velocity (PWV; arterial stiffness measurement) and brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD; endothelial function measurement) were assessed by
      applanation tonometry and ultrasound, respectively, in HD patients only. RESULTS:
      Mean dp-ucMGP levels were 5.6 times higher in HD patients vs. controls (2,139 +/-
      1,102 vs. 382 +/- 181 pmol/l, P < 0.01). Multiple linear regression, adjusting
      for age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes mellitus, CVD history, body mass index, 
      and blood pressure, revealed that dp-ucMGP was independently related to PWV
      (standardized beta = 0.49) and FMD (standardized beta = -0.53) (both P < 0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the higher plasma dp-ucMGP concentrations
      found in African American HD patients may be associated with greater arterial
      stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 is a strong predictor of insulin resistance among
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 226-230
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455594 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is very common among chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      patients. Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism (MBD) seems to play a role
      in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is
      evolving as the most important link between MBD and many pathologic sequences of 
      CKD. The aim was to evaluate IR in pre-dialysis CKD patients looking for a
      possible association to mineral metabolism among CKD patients. A total of 100
      stage 3-5 CKD patients were selected beside 20 normal control subjects.
      Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess
      IR in selected cases. Both groups were compared for fasting blood glucose (FBG), 
      fasting blood insulin (FBI), HOMA-IR, estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH vit D),
      parathormone (PTH), and uric acid (UA). Correlation study between HOMA_IR and
      different studied parameters was performed. HOMA-IR is significantly higher in
      CKD (8.87 +/- 3.48 vs. 3.97 +/- 0.34 in CKD vs. control, respectively, p < .001).
      In addition CKD patients have significantly higher FGF23 (235 +/- 22.96 vs. 139
      +/- 12.3 pg/mL, p < .001), PTH (76.9 +/- 15.27 vs. 47.9 +/- 2.52 pg/mL, p <
      .001), P (4.3 +/- 0.67 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.23 mg/dL, p < .001), and UA (5 +/- 1.22 vs. 
      4.85 +/- 0.48 mg/dL, p < .001) and significantly lower Ca (8.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.9
      +/- 0.33 mg/dL, p < .001), and 25 (OH) vit D (17 +/- 5.63 vs. 37 +/- 3.43 ng/mL, 
      p < .001). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that BMI, GFR, Ca, P, and
      FGF23 were the only significant predictors of HOMA IR. Increased IR in CKD is a
      consequence of the uremic status and is intimately associated with disturbed
      phosphate metabolism and FGF23. Further studies are needed to look for an
      underlying mechanism.

TI  - Usefulness of pretransplant aortic arch calcification evaluation for kidney
      transplant outcome prediction in one year follow-up.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455588 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events
      and hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We 
      aimed to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can
      predict post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to
      assess its association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal
      function in one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study
      enrolled 37 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of
      vascular events. Two radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as 
      suggested by Ogawa et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The
      mismatching results were repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus.
      Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was
      measured using applanation tonometry before and one year after transplantation.
      Patient clinical, biochemical data, and cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored
      within 1 year. We found out that eGFR1year correlated with eGFRdischarge and
      calcium based on hospital discharge data (beta = 0.563, p = .004 and beta =
      51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear regression revealed that
      donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFRdischarge (R-squared 0.65, p = .002)
      better predict eGFR1year than AoAC combined with recipient eGFRdischarge
      (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four (10.81%) patients
      experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV ratio (HR 7.549, p
      = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In conclusion, KTR
      without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE rate within
      1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray together with
      recipient eGFRdischarge could be related to kidney function in one-year
      follow-up.

TI  - The relationship between poor nutritional status and progression of aortic
      calcification in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/s12882-018-0872-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on
      prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification
      progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in
      patients on HD. METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232
      patients on HD. Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who
      had had regular blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal
      aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT.
      Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index
      (GNRI). A normalized treatment ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated
      by Kt/V. The difference in ACI values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a
      DeltaACI, and patients were stratified into two groups according to DeltaACI
      value: high (>/=75th percentile, DeltaACI-high group) and low (<75th percentile, 
      DeltaACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, dialysis vintage,
      serum data, and GNRI were compared between DeltaACI-high and DeltaACI-low
      patients. Factors independently associated with a higher DeltaACI progression
      (DeltaACI >/=75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic
      analysis. RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%,
      respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for
      1 year. The median DeltaACI and 75th percentile of DeltaACI were 2.5% and 5.8%,
      respectively. The number of patients in the DeltaACI-low and DeltaACI-high groups
      were 128 (70%) and 56 (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in 
      sex, presence of diabetic nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum
      phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent factors
      associated with a higher DeltaACI progression were male sex, serum phosphate
      levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that poor 
      nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the progression of aortic
      calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to improve progression
      of aortic calcification in patients on HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) develop
      significant vascular calcification early in life, the cause of which is not yet
      fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney disease have similar vascular
      calcification, with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in these
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between
      patients with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether there is a
      correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol,
      and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with HoFH. METHODS: The study was 
      a cross-sectional review involving 30 patients with HoFH attending the Charlotte 
      Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital Lipid Clinic in Parktown, South Africa, as 
      well as 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. FGF23, fasting lipid
      profiles, calcium, and phosphate were measured. B-mode ultrasonography of the
      carotid arteries was done to assess the extent and severity of arterial
      calcification. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient
      and control groups (62.07 +/- 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 +/- 19.84 pg/mL; P = .4621)
      nor was there any correlation between FGF23 and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (P = .9483 and .8474) or total cholesterol (P = .9261 and .859). In
      the HoFH patients, FGF23 did not correlate significantly with any cardiovascular 
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when
      compared to non-familial hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched controls,
      and there is no correlation between serum FGF23 and cardiovascular disease in
      patients with HoFH. FGF23 does not appear to be a major factor for arterial
      calcification in HoFH.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of coronary microvascular dysfunction among chest 
      pain patients in the emergency department.
PG  - 2048872618764418
LID - 10.1177/2048872618764418 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is common in patients with
      non-obstructive coronary arteries but has not been described in low-risk
      symptomatic patients. We therefore assessed the prevalence and characteristics of
      CMD in low to moderate risk patients with chest pain in an emergency department. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We used three-dimensional Rb(82) cardiac positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography to diagnose coronary artery disease (known or new 
      regional defect, any coronary calcification) and CMD (low coronary flow reserve
      without coronary artery disease) in chest pain patients after being ruled out for
      acute myocardial infarction. Exclusions included age 30 years or less, acute
      myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, heart failure and dialysis. Among
      195 participants undergoing cardiac positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography, 42% had CMD, 36% had coronary artery disease and 22% had normal
      flows; 70% were women and 84% were obese. Patients with CMD and coronary artery
      disease had significantly lower coronary flow reserve than normal patients (mean 
      coronary flow reserve 1.6 and 1.9 vs. 2.6, respectively, P<0.05). However, CMD
      patients were younger (mean age 51 vs. 61 years), and had fewer traditional
      cardiac risk factors ( P<0.05) than patients with coronary artery disease. Nearly
      one third (31%) of patients had a prior emergency department visit for chest pain
      within three years of index presentation. Women were four times as likely to have
      CMD as men (adjusted odds ratio 4.2; 95% confidence interval 1.8, 9.6) after
      controlling for age, race, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity
      and family history of coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their
      low-risk profile, nearly one half of symptomatic and mostly obese emergency
      department patients without evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery 
      disease had CMD. The results could explain the high rates of return visits
      associated with chest pain, although their application to the general emergency
      department population require validation.

TI  - Lower Serum Irisin Levels Are Associated with Increased Vascular Calcification in
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1159/000487689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is
      prevalent and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex
      and unclear. We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play
      roles in vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to
      evaluate serum irisin levels and establish their relation to vascular
      calcification and other parameters in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 
      150 patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin
      concentrations were measured by ELISA. Vascular calcification was evaluated by
      abdominal aortic calcification scores. RESULTS: Serum irisin concentrations were 
      significantly lower in hemodialysis patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0)
      vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively
      correlated with the parathyroid hormone level (P=0.01). The HD patients with
      vascular calcification showed significantly lower serum irisin concentrations
      [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, P<0.01]. Compared with the group 
      without vascular calcification multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed
      that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were significant independent determinant
      factors for vascular calcification in HD patients. CONCLUSION: Our results are
      the first to provide a clinical evidence of the association between serum irisin 
      and vascular calcification in HD patients. Lower irisin levels, long-term
      hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk factors in HD patients.

AB  - Uremia accelerates atherosclerosis, but little is known about affected pathways
      in human vasculature. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed
      arterial transcripts in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Global mRNA
      expression was estimated by microarray hybridization in iliac arteries ( n = 14) 
      from renal transplant recipients and compared with renal arteries from healthy
      living kidney donors ( n = 19) in study 1. Study 2 compared nonatherosclerotic
      internal mammary arteries (IMA) from five patients with elevated plasma
      creatinine levels and age- and sex-matched controls with normal creatinine
      levels. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry for selected proteins were
      performed on a subset of study 1 samples. Fifteen gene transcripts were
      significantly different between the two groups in study 1 [fold changes (FC) >
      1.05 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.005]. Most upregulated mRNAs associated 
      with cellular signaling, apoptosis, TNFalpha/NF-kappaB signaling, smooth muscle
      contraction, and 10 other pathways were significantly affected. To focus
      attention on genes from genuine vascular cells, which dominate in IMA, concordant
      deregulated genes in studies 1 and 2 were examined and included 23 downregulated 
      and eight upregulated transcripts (settings in study 1: FC > 1.05 and FDR < 0.05;
      study 2: FC > 1.2 and P < 0.2). Selected deregulated gene products were
      investigated at the protein level, and whereas HIF3alpha confirmed mRNA
      upregulation, vimentin showed upregulation in contrast to the mRNA results. We
      conclude that arteries from CKD patients display change in relatively few sets of
      genes. Many were related to differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype.
      These identified genes may contribute to understanding the development of
      arterial injury among patients with CKD.

TI  - Aortic bypass surgery for asymptomatic patients awaiting a kidney transplant: A
      word of caution.
PG  - e13218
LID - 10.1111/ctr.13218 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the presence of severe aorto-iliac calcification, aortic bypass 
      surgery can be mandatory to allow kidney transplantation. The aim of our study
      was to evaluate the safety and outcomes of this strategy among asymptomatic
      patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all
      patients that had undergone vascular bypass surgery prior to kidney
      transplantation between November 2004 and March 2016. All patients undergoing
      aortic bypass surgery prior to kidney transplantation without any
      vascular-related symptoms were included. RESULTS: Twenty-one asymptomatic
      patients were included. Ten patients (48%) have not received a kidney transplant.
      Four patients died before kidney transplantation, including 2 deaths related to
      the bypass surgery (9.5%). Early post-operative morbidity involved 11 cases.
      Eleven patients (52%) were transplanted. Transplanted patients were significantly
      younger (median age 60 [56-61] vs 67 [60-72] years, P = .04) at the time of
      bypass and were less frequently treated for coronary heart disease (9% vs 50%, P 
      = .06). CONCLUSION: Aortic bypass surgery performed prior to kidney
      transplantation among asymptomatic patients has significant mortality and
      morbidity rates. When transplantation is possible, the results are satisfying.
      Larger studies are required to define the selection criteria, such as age and
      coronary heart disease.

TI  - Arteriosclerosis Is a Major Predictor of Small Bowel Vascular Lesions.
PG  - 723-730
LID - 10.1007/s10620-018-4930-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies have focused on evaluating the association between the
      presence of small bowel vascular lesions (SBVLs) and patients' comorbidities.
      AIMS: We sought to uncover a more fundamental indicator that may predict the
      presence of SBVLs by considering atherosclerosis qualitatively and
      quantitatively. METHODS: We enrolled 79 consecutive patients with obscure
      gastrointestinal bleeding who had undergone computed tomography (CT) and capsule 
      endoscopy or double-balloon endoscopy from January 2015 to June 2017. The SBVL
      frequency, type, and location, and the relationship between the presence of SBVLs
      and the patients' clinical characteristics were evaluated. Arterial wall
      calcification was assessed on unenhanced CT images, and a modified Agatston
      scoring system was used to determine the abdominal aorta calcium scores. RESULTS:
      Of the 27 (34%) patients with SBVLs, 15 (19%) had type 1a, 12 (15%) had type 1b, 
      and 2 (3%) had type 2a SBVLs. Most of the lesions were located in the jejunum.
      Cardiovascular disease (P = .017), chronic kidney disease (P = .025), and
      arteriosclerosis (P = .0036) were associated with the presence of SBVLs.
      Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that arteriosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 
      7.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-143.9) and superior mesenteric artery
      calcification (OR 16.3; 95% CI 3.64-118.6) were independent predictors of the
      presence of SBVLs. The modified Agatston score was significantly higher in SBVL
      cases than in non-SBVL cases (6384 vs. 2666, P = .0023). CONCLUSIONS:
      Arteriosclerosis, especially increased superior mesenteric artery calcification, 
      is associated with an increased likelihood of SBVLs.

      in Chronic Renal Failure Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 1312-1321
LID - 10.1159/000486114 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This cross-sectional study was designed to assess the
      relationship between vascular stiffness (VS) and bone-related proteins involved
      in the development of arteriosclerosis in patients on regular hemodialysis (HD). 
      METHODS: 68 consecutive patients in stable clinical condition who received
      regular HD in the FMC Dialysis Center, Pecs were included. VS parameters
      (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity - PWV, aortic augmentation index - AIx) were
      determined by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sidney) and the
      routine latoratory test were completed with measurements of osteocalcin (OC),
      osteopontin (OP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) by using commercially available ELISA 
      kits. 35 heathcare workers served as controls. RESULTS: In patients on regular HD
      PWV markedly increased and there was several-fold elevation in the interrelated
      bone-specific proteins (OC, OP, OPG). PWV was found to be independently
      associated only with OC (beta:-0.25, p<0.029) and age (r=0.411,p<0.000), but risk
      factors for arterial calcification had significant impact on OC (systolic blood
      pressure, hsCRP, BMI), OPG (age, BMI) and OP (LDL-cholesterol). CONCLUSION:
      Except for OC, our results failed to document direct association of vascular
      lesion with OP and OPG, therefore their high circulating levels may be an
      epiphenomenon or they may have counter-regulatory role to attenuate the uremic
      calcification process.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification in the Brazilian
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil).
PG  - 1309-1315
LID - 10.1002/clc.22829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health concern due to
      the increased prevalence the high fatalities related to heart disease in this
      population. Among novel cardiovascular risk markers, the coronary artery
      calcification score (CAC) emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular
      events. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to test if glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria
      are independently associated with coronary calcification. METHODS: The Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health is a cohort of men and women aged 35 to 74
      years old addressing cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the association of CAC,
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)
      according to stages of eGFR (1 = >/=90; 2 = 60-89; 3 = <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ),
      and ACR (<30; 30 to 300; >300 mg/g). These associations were estimated by
      logistic regression with a model including age, sex, race, income, and
      cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Among 4189 persons (median age = 51 years, 
      54% women), 1183 had CAC. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval
      (95% CI) in the multivariate model was 0.86 (0.58-1.29) for the category of eGFR 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) compared to people with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m(2) . On the
      other hand, the OR (95% CI) for individuals with ACR >300 mg/g was 4.31
      (1.27-14.64) compared to people with ACR <30 mg/g. A discrete interaction factor 
      for the association with CAC between eGFR and ACR were analyzed as continuous
      variable. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria was independently associated with coronary
      calcification, but the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate was not
      associated with CAC score in this sample of apparently healthy adults.

TI  - Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict
      mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1758-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard
      for evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and
      less costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral 
      arteries has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome
      predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in
      predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. METHODS: Four
      hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic
      radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to
      the methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients
      were followed prospectively for 5 years. RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated
      well with the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and
      0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were
      older, showed higher prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but 
      lower serum albumin and eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an 
      increase in KT duration, whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with 
      worsening kidney function and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival
      curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality
      in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor
      of all-cause mortality in all three populations. After adjusting for age, the
      predictability of AAC was lost, whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of 
      mortality in all three populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk
      factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate
      attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients.
      CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT
      patients.

TI  - Preoperative assessment of computerized tomography angiography to predict success
      for crossing long Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions using the
      optical coherence tomography catheter.
PG  - 362-367
LID - 10.1177/1708538117742828 [doi]
AB  - Objectives Optical coherence tomography chronic total occlusion catheter, the
      Ocelot (Avinger Inc., Redwood City, CA), has been utilized to cross
      Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions. This study evaluated the
      preoperative computerized tomography angiography of chronic total occlusions in
      the superficial femoral artery to predict clinical success. Methods We reviewed
      all patients who underwent lower extremity procedures with the Ocelot catheter
      from June 2014 to August 2016. Patients who had a preoperative computerized
      tomography angiography were evaluated. Final outcomes, plaque morphology, lesion 
      length, calcium surface area, lesion location, and patient characteristics were
      analyzed. Results A total of 107 patients underwent lower extremity interventions
      with the Ocelot catheter. Seventy patients had a preoperative computerized
      tomography angiography scan prior to lower extremity intervention and 77% (54)
      had Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions that were crossed. Mean age 
      was 62.8 years and 68.6% were male. Mean chronic total occlusion length was 182.7
      mm (170.8 mm crossed vs. 222.6 mm uncrossed, p = 0.03). Calcium distribution
      differed significantly ( p<.01): circumferential (14.8 vs. 12.5%); eccentric (85 
      vs. 62.5%); and complete calcium occlusion (0 vs. 25%) for lesions that were
      crossed and uncrossed, respectively. Significant differences ( p<.0001) were
      found when calcium occlusion was less than 50% (87 vs. 31%), 51-75% (9.3 vs.
      31.2%), and 76-100% (3.7 vs. 37.5%). Total calcium length in crossed lesion was
      51.6 mm, and 92.8 mm in uncrossed lesions ( p = 0.10). No significant differences
      were noted for patient gender, occlusion location (proximal, middle, and distal
      superficial femoral artery), and kidney function. Conclusion The Ocelot catheter 
      is an effective method to cross long Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D
      lesions. Superficial femoral artery lesions longer than 17 cm and focal plaque
      morphology, specifically a total cross-sectional area of calcium and a calcium
      surface area greater than 50% were most predictive of failure to cross
      Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D superficial femoral artery lesions.
      Computerized tomography angiography is an effective tool to predict success for
      crossing chronic total occlusions using optical coherence tomography technology
      and a critical consideration for patient selection.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 137-142
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1740-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign
      of severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes.
      Fetuin-A and osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in
      patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD 
      therapy. However, there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on
      dialysis. The aim of our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the
      relationship between VC and 25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and
      independent predictors of VC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with
      ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were
      female. The patient group was compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of
      similar age and sex. A plain radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography
      machine for the evaluation of VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels
      of both patients and controls were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45
      (48.4%) HD patients. When patients were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A 
      levels (p < 0.029) were significantly lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) 
      and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly higher in the patient group. Age [odds
      ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were independent predictors of VC in 
      a logistic regression model including the following factors: age, the presence of
      DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A,
      OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was found between patients
      with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients undergoing HD and is not
      related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the presence of DM, and
      high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients undergoing HD.
      Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying and the
      factors contributing to VC.

TI  - The relationship between intradialytic hypotension and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - e0185846
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185846 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with structural and functional
      abnormality of the heart and blood vessels. We investigated the relationship
      between intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and vascular calcification in
      hemodialysis (HD) patients, and their impacts on cardiovascular events (CVEs).
      METHOD: We enrolled 191 maintenance HD patients who underwent plain abdomen
      radiography for abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). A nadir systolic
      blood pressure (BP) < 90 mm Hg or the requirement of bolus fluid administration
      was required to quantify the hypotension diagnosis. IDH was defined as > 2
      hypotension episodes during 10 HD treatments. RESULTS: Among the 191 patients,
      IDH occurred in 32. AACS was higher in the IDH group compared with the no-IDH
      group (8.4 +/- 6.0 vs. 4.9 +/- 5.2, respectively; P = 0.001). High AACS was an
      independent risk factor after adjustment for age, diabetes mellitus,
      ultrafiltration, diastolic BP, and calcium level (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI 
      = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). Patients with both IDH and AACS >== 4 had the highest
      cumulative CVE rate (27.9%, P = 0.008) compared with 11.2%, 12.5%, and 6% for
      those with AACS >== 4 only, with IDH only, and neither, respectively. In
      multivariate analysis, the presence of both IDH and AACS >== 4 was a significant 
      predictor of CVE (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.04-7.74, P = 0.04).
      CONCLUSION: IDH is associated with abdominal aortic calcification and is an
      independent risk factor for IDH. Both IDH and high AACS were significant
      predictors of CVE.

TI  - Adenine-induced chronic kidney disease in rats.
PG  - 5-11
LID - 10.1111/nep.13180 [doi]
AB  - Many animal models have been developed to study the causes and treatments of
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans, an insidious disease resulting from
      kidney injury and characterized by persistent functional decline for more than 3 
      months, with or without evidence of structural deficit. The eventual outcome of
      CKD may be end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), where patients need dialysis or
      transplantation to survive. Cardiovascular disease is accelerated in patients
      with CKD and contributes to increased mortality, with the relationship between
      CKD and cardiovascular disease being bi-directional. Most animal models do not
      mimic the complexity of the human disease as many do not develop CKD-associated
      cardiovascular disease. The adenine diet model of CKD in rodents is an exception.
      The original adenine diet model produced rapid-onset kidney disease with
      extensive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, crystal formation and
      marked vessel calcification. Since then, lower adenine intake in rats has been
      found to induce slowly progressive kidney damage and cardiovascular disease.
      These chronic adenine diet models allow the characterization of relatively stable
      kidney and cardiovascular disease, similar to CKD in humans. In addition,
      interventions for reversal can be tested. Here the key features of the adenine
      diet model of CKD are noted, along with some limitations of other available
      models. In summary, the data presented here support the use of chronic low-dose
      adenine diet in rats as an easy and effective model for understanding human CKD, 
      especially the links with cardiovascular disease, and developing potential
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Plasma biomarkers improve prediction of diabetic kidney disease in adults with
      type 1 diabetes over a 12-year follow-up: CACTI study.
PG  - 1189-1196
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx255 [doi]
AB  - Background: The objective of the study was to determine whether plasma biomarkers
      of kidney injury improve the prediction of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in
      adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over a period of 12 years. Methods:
      Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary Artery Calcification in T1D
      (CACTI) Study were examined during 2002-04, at a mean (+/- standard deviation)
      age of 39.6 +/- 9.0 years with 24.8 years as the median duration of diabetes.
      Urine albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      by CKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) creatinine were
      measured at the baseline and after mean follow-up of 12.1 +/- 1.5 years.
      Albuminuria was defined as ACR >/=30 mg/g and impaired GFR as eGFR <60
      mL/min/1.73 m2. Kidney injury biomarkers (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were measured
      on stored baseline plasma samples. A principal component analysis (PCA)
      identified two components: (i) kidney injury molecule-1, calbindin, osteoactivin,
      trefoil factor 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor; and (ii) beta-2
      microglobulin, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and
      osteopontin that were used in the multivariable regression analyses. Results:
      Component 2 of the PCA was associated with increase in log modulus ACR [beta +/- 
      standard error (SE): 0.16 +/- 0.07, P = 0.02] and eGFR (beta +/- SE: -2.56 +/-
      0.97, P = 0.009) over a period of 12 years after adjusting for traditional risk
      factors (age, sex, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood 
      pressure and baseline eGFR/baseline ACR). Only Component 2 of the PCA was
      associated with incident-impaired GFR (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval
      1.18-3.67, P = 0.01), adjusting for traditional risk factors. The addition of
      Component 2 to traditional risk factors significantly improved C-statistics and
      net-reclassification improvement for incident-impaired GFR (DeltaAUC: 0.02 +/-
      0.01, P = 0.049, and 29% non-events correctly reclassified, P < 0.0001).
      Conclusions: Plasma kidney injury biomarkers can help predict development of DKD 
      in T1D.

TI  - Outcomes of Patients With a History of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Who
      Underwent Orbital Atherectomy for Severe Coronary Artery Calcification.
PG  - 359-362
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assess the angiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with a
      history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery who underwent orbital
      atherectomy for the treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions. BACKGROUND:
      The presence of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) increases the
      complexity of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with
      worse clinical outcomes. Patients with a history of CABG who undergo PCI often
      have comorbidities and are at higher risk for ischemic complications. METHODS: Of
      the 458 patients who underwent orbital atherectomy, 77 patients (17%) had a
      history of CABG and 381 (83%) did not. The primary endpoint was rate of 30-day
      major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), comprised of cardiac
      death, myocardial infarction (MI), target-vessel revascularization (TVR), and
      stroke. RESULTS: The CABG group had a higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic 
      renal insufficiency, history of PCI, and unstable angina. The primary endpoint
      was similar in the CABG and non-CABG groups (1% vs 2%; P=.56), as were the
      individual endpoints of cardiac death (0% vs 2%; P=.27), MI (1% vs 1%; P=.85),
      TVR (0% vs 0%; P>.99), and stroke (0% vs 0%; P=.65). The rates of angiographic
      complications and stent thrombosis were similarly low in both groups. CONCLUSION:
      Despite a higher-risk baseline profile, patients with a history of CABG had
      similar angiographic and clinical outcomes compared with patients who had no
      previous history of CABG. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of
      orbital atherectomy in these patients.

TI  - The association between the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary calcification
      may differ depending on kidney function in a healthy population.
PG  - e0185522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185522 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio has been reported to be one of the
      strongest risk predictors of cardiovascular events. However, its prognostic value
      for cardiovascular disease is still uncertain, especially in patients with
      chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to investigate whether the association
      between the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary artery calcification differed
      according to kidney function in a healthy population. METHODS: Of the data from
      7,780 participants from the medical records database in Gangnam Severance
      Hospital from 2005 through 2016, a cross-sectional analysis included participants
      with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
      determined based on the Chronic Kidney Disease -Epidemiology Collaboration
      equation (n = 1,800). Mild renal insufficiency was defined as an eGFR of 60-90
      mL/min/1.73 m2. Coronary artery calcification measured with computed tomography
      was defined as an above-zero score. Logistic regression analyses were used to
      determine the association between coronary calcification and the apolipoprotein
      B/A-I ratio according to eGFR by adjusting for the influence of confounders.
      RESULTS: The mean apolipoprotein B/A-I level was significantly higher in the
      participants with coronary artery calcification than in the participants without 
      coronary artery calcification. The apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was significantly
      different according to coronary artery calcification in the participants with
      normal kidney function, but in the participants with mild renal insufficiency, it
      was not different. After adjusting for age, male sex, systolic blood pressure,
      body mass index, current smoking status, and fasting plasma glucose, the
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk of
      coronary artery calcification in participants with normal kidney function (odds
      ratio = 2.411, p = 0.011), while in the participants with mild renal
      insufficiency, the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was not associated with coronary
      artery calcification. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the predictive value of
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio for coronary artery calcification may differ according
      to kidney function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common and may affect cardiac function in
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about the 
      effect of residual renal function on vascular calcification and cardiac function 
      in patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: This study was conducted between January
      2014 and January 2017. One hundred six patients with residual renal function on
      maintenance hemodialysis for 3 months were recruited. We used residual renal urea
      clearance (KRU) to measure residual renal function. First, abdominal aortic
      calcification score (AACS) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were
      measured in patients on hemodialysis. Second, we performed echocardiography and
      investigated new cardiovascular events after study enrollment. RESULTS: The
      median KRU was 0.9 (0.3-2.5) mL/min/1.73m2. AACS (4.0 [1.0-10.0] vs. 3.0
      [0.0-8.0], p = 0.05) and baPWV (1836.1 +/- 250.4 vs. 1676.8 +/- 311.0 cm/s, p =
      0.01) were significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than a
      KRU >/= 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2. Log-KRU significantly negatively correlated with
      log-AACS (ss = -0.29, p = 0.002) and baPWV (ss = -0.19, P = 0.05) after factor
      adjustment. The proportion of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was
      significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than with a KRU
      >/= 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (67.9% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.05). Patients with a KRU < 0.9
      mL/min/1.73m2 showed a higher tendency of cumulative cardiovascular events
      compared to those with a KRU >/= 0.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS:
      Residual renal function was significantly associated with vascular calcification 
      and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients on hemodialysis.

TI  - Cigarette Smoking is Associated with Decreased Bone Gla-protein (BGP) Levels in
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 603-609

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-protein (BGP or osteocalcin) is
      a vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. 
      Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis. METHODS: We carried out a secondary
      analysis of the Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) study to investigate the association
      between cigarette smoking and BGP levels in patients with end stage renal
      disease. Data were collected in 370 haemodialysis patients, 37% (136) smokers (or
      ex-smokers) and 63% (234) nonsmokers. Vascular calcifications and vertebral
      fractures (quantitative morphometry) were identified on spine radiographs.
      RESULTS: Smokers had significantly lower BGP levels (152 vs. 204 microg/L,
      p=0.003). Smokers had lower plasma phosphate levels (4.2 vs. 4.7 mg/dl, p<0.01). 
      Lower BGP levels were associated with aortic calcification (p<0.001), iliac
      calcification (p=0.042) and vertebral fractures (p=0.023). In addition, the
      regression model showed that smoking is associated with a significant reduction
      of total BGP levels by about 18% (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical
      study in a haemodialysis population, which identifies cigarette smoking as a
      potential factor that can lower BGP levels, a protective agent in bone and
      vascular health.

TI  - Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) scores in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral arterial disease are associated with increased cardiac mortality and
      morbidity.
PG  - e0182952
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0182952 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The association of coronary arterial calcification with cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality is well-recognized. Lower limb arterial calcification
      (LLAC) is common in PAD but its impact on subsequent health is poorly described. 
      We aimed to determine the association between a LLAC score and subsequent
      cardiovascular events in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease
      (PAD). METHODS: LLAC scoring, and the established Bollinger score, were derived
      from a database of unenhanced CT scans, from patients presenting with symptomatic
      PAD. We determined the association between these scores outcomes. The primary
      outcome was combined cardiac mortality and morbidity (CM/M) with a secondary
      outcome of all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 220 patients (66% male; median age 69
      years) were included with follow-up for a median 46 [IQR 31-64] months. Median
      total LLAC scores were higher in those patients suffering a primary outcome (6831
      vs. 1652; p = 0.012). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.039), ischaemic heart disease (p =
      0.028), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.026) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.012)
      were more common in patients in the highest quartile of LLAC scores. The area
      under the curve of the receiver operator curve for the LLAC score was greater
      (0.929: 95% CI [0.884-0.974]) than for the Bollinger score (0.824: 95% CI
      [0.758-0.890]) for the primary outcome. A LLAC score >/= 4400 had the best
      diagnostic accuracy to determine the outcome measure. CONCLUSION: This is the
      largest study to investigate links between lower limb arterial calcification and 
      cardiovascular events in symptomatic PAD. We describe a straightforward,
      reproducible, CT-derived measure of calcification-the LLAC score.

TI  - Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with changes in bone mineral
      markers in advanced CKD.
PG  - 281
LID - 10.1186/s12882-017-0705-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are
      limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD,
      including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast
      growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble alpha-klotho (sKl). METHODS: In this
      prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis,
      including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 
      and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic
      calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline.
      RESULTS: Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) 19.5 +/- 6.7 mL/min/1.73m(2)] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 88.6 +/- 12.9
      mL/min/1.73m(2)) completed follow-up. There were no differences in age, gender
      and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 [240.6
      (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD
      group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not
      change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC
      prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV
      [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m,
      aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p <
      0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal
      aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with
      AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness
      and serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk,
      increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant
      association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and
      stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to
      delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms
      linking FGF23 and vascular disease.

AB  - Renal artery calcium (RAC) has been shown to be associated with higher odds of
      hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this study was to determine if the presence
      and extent of RAC is associated with renal function. We analyzed cross-sectional 
      data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). A subsample of 1,226 
      participants underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and also had venous
      blood samples measured for kidney function. RAC was the primary predictor
      variable and the following measures of kidney function were the outcome
      variables: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. The
      analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, height, visceral fat, dyslipidemia,
      diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, interleukin-6 and abdominal aortic
      calcium (AAC). The average age of this cohort was 66.1 years (SD 9.7), 44.8% (549
      of 1,226) were men, and nearly 30% had RAC >0. Compared with those with no RAC,
      those with RAC >0 were significantly older but not different by gender or race.
      After adjustment for age, gender, and race, those with RAC >0 had significantly
      higher visceral fat, were more likely to have dyslipidemia, diabetes, and
      hypertension, had a higher interleukin-6, and a higher prevalence of AAC >0. The 
      mean eGFR and UACR among those without RAC were 80 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 21 mg/g, 
      whereas these values were 78 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 55 mg/g among those with RAC.
      In fully adjusted multivariable linear regression models, the presence of RAC was
      associated with a lower eGFR (beta = -2.21, p = 0.06) but not with UACR (beta =
      0.02, p = 0.79). In fully adjusted ordinal logistic regression, RAC as a
      continuous variable was associated with increased odds of being in a worse CKD
      category (odds ratio 1.14, p = 0.05). When measured by eGFR and CKD stage, there 
      is a modest relation between RAC and kidney function. Further studies might
      involve clinical trials to assess the role of intensive cardiovascular disease
      risk factor management in patients with subclinical RAC to determine if this may 
      prevent or delay the development and progression of CKD.

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients
      and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the 
      association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial
      stiffness has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING
      trial (vitamin K2 In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the
      association between the change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial
      stiffness following 8 weeks of menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360
      mug once daily) among renal transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness
      was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical
      vitamin K deficiency was defined as plasma concentration of
      dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At
      baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had subclinical vitamin K deficiency.
      Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks
      (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 +/- 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 +/- 1.5
      m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also significantly reduced by
      55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a reduction in the prevalence 
      of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When controlled for age, durations
      of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 24-hour mean arterial
      pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was independently associated with
      the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration (P = .014).Among renal transplant
      recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 supplementation was associated 
      with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency and arterial stiffness.

TI  - Study of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders in newly detected advanced
      renal failure patients: A Hospital-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - 874-885
AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected,
      untreated predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a
      tertiary care hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational
      study. A total of 95 (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent
      clinical evaluation, biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline 
      phosphatase (ALP), albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-
      hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any
      abnormality including fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular 
      calcification (CVC)]. Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 
      33.6% of the study patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia,
      hyperparathyroidism, and hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%,
      respectively. CVC was seen in 22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly
      involving the mitral valve. Patients with CVC were more likely to be males and
      smokers. There was no significant difference in iPTH levels between patients with
      or without CVC. AAC was seen in 10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray.
      Patients with AAC had higher levels of iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels
      of calcium compared to patients without AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in
      41.05% of our patients and was more prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study
      patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that
      newly detected, naive Indian CKD patients have a high prevalence of disturbances 
      of mineral metabolism including hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency,
      abnormal BMD, and valvular and vascular calcification, even before initiating
      dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney-related unknown vascular injuries are rare and usually
      diagnosed only after reperfusion. Hemorrhage that makes in situ reconstruction
      impossible can lead to graft loss. In an era of organ shortage and an increasing 
      number of patients on the waiting list for transplantation, a kidney graft
      salvage procedure consisting of graft nephrectomy, reperfusion, reconstruction,
      and reimplantation should be undertaken whenever possible as a contribution to
      extending the organs available for transplantation. METHODS AND PATIENTS: From
      January 2010 to December 2015, in total five patients suffered from
      intraoperative or immediate postoperative vascular complication and were included
      for this retrospective analysis. Age, sex, etiology of kidney failure, delayed
      graft function, kind of vascular complications and therapy, presence of
      aortoiliac calcification, cold and warm ischemia time, and length of hospital
      stay were analyzed. RESULTS: By applying this "one-step-back" procedure in three 
      consecutive patients and a structured in situ repair in two patients, all grafts 
      were saved. Two of five patients developed delayed graft function requiring
      hemodialysis. At discharge, graft function was excellent in all five patients.
      Reconstructed vasculature showed 100% patency. CONCLUSION: These graft salvage
      strategies are safe with excellent outcome and should be considered in the event 
      of an acute vascular complication during kidney transplantation.

TI  - The impact of coronary calcification on angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes

AB  - Coronary calcification (CCA) is one of the independent predictors for major
      adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in coronary intervention. Post-marketing
      surveillance study Japan is a prospective registry designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the everolimus-eluting stent (EES, XIENCE V/PROMUS Stent) 
      in routine clinical practice at 47 centers. In this study, 1848 lesions (1546
      patients) were assessed using quantitative coronary angiography. In these 1546
      patients, renal function data were unknown in 26 patients. Three patients in 70
      patients with dialysis and 56 patients in 1450 patients with no dialysis were
      excluded, because they had multiple lesions with mixed calcification lesions. We 
      evaluated the effects of CCA on 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes
      in dialysis and non-dialysis patients. Moderate-to-severe (Ca group) and
      none-to-mild CCA (non-Ca group) were observed in 33 lesions (30 patients) and 48 
      lesions (37 patients) in dialysis patients, and these were observed in 306
      lesions (286 patients) and 1303 lesions (1108 patients) in non-dialysis patients,
      respectively. In non-dialysis patients, the ischemic-driven target lesion
      revascularization (ID-TLR) and MACE rate over the 3 years were significantly
      higher in the Ca group than in the non-Ca group (5.8 vs. 3.1%, p = 0.025 and 10.0
      vs. 5.0%, p = 0.0011). In dialysis patients, ID-TLR and MACE rates were high in
      both groups (14.3 vs. 17.9%, p = 0.85 and 17.5 vs. 36.1%, p = 0.16). In
      non-dialysis patients, 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes were
      worse in the Ca group. However, in dialysis patients, both outcomes were worse
      regardless of CCA.Clinical Trial registration

TI  - Serum cystatin C levels are associated with coronary artery calcification in
      women without chronic kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic renal disease (CKD) is a determinant of coronary artery
      calcification (CAC), which is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, in a
      population without CKD, the association between CAC and renal function is
      unclear. CAC is affected by sex. This study aimed to determine whether serum
      cystatin C, a sensitive marker of kidney function, or sex differences are
      associated with CAC in patients without CKD. METHODS: We evaluated 456
      consecutive patients (61+/-13 years, 42% women) without CKD and evidence of
      coronary artery disease. The CAC (Agatston) score was examined by multidetector
      computed tomography. RESULTS: When patients were categorized into three CAC
      groups based on the Agatston score, mild (<10), moderate (11-399), and severe
      (>/=400) in each sex, serum cystatin C levels gradually increased by severity of 
      CAC in women, but not men. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
      showed that, in women, a cut-off value of 0.97mg/l for cystatin C discriminated
      patients with severe CAC with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 77% (area
      under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p<0.01). Multivariate logistic analysis
      showed that serum cystatin C was not associated with severe CAC in all patients
      and men, but this association was observed in women (OR: 7.80 for cystatin
      C>/=0.97mg/l, 95% CI: 1.76-34.6, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C
      levels are associated with greater CAC in women without CKD. Measurement of
      cystatin C may be useful for identifying women who are at high risk for
      cardiovascular disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the outcomes of patients who presented with
      non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent
      orbital atherectomy for severe coronary artery calcification (CAC). BACKGROUND:
      Patients who present with NSTEMI have increased risk for death and recurrent MI
      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with severe CAC have
      worse outcomes after PCI.Orbital atherectomy modifies calcified plaque,
      facilitating stent delivery and optimizing stent expansion. There are no data on 
      these patients who present with NSTEMI who undergo orbital atherectomy. METHODS: 
      Of the 454 consecutive real-world patients who underwent orbital atherectomy in
      our retrospective multicenter registry, 51 patients (11.2%) presented with
      NSTEMI. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30days. RESULTS: Patients with NSTEMI had a
      higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, lower mean ejection fraction, and
      required more vessels to be treated. The primary endpoint was similar in patients
      who presented with and without NSTEMI (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p=0.9), as were the 30-day 
      rates of death (2.0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.67), MI (0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.42), target vessel
      revascularization (0% vs. 0%, p>0.91), and stroke (0% vs. 0.2%, p=0.72). The
      rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis rate were low in both
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having worse baseline characteristics, patients who 
      presented with NSTEMI and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy had similar 
      clinical outcomes compared with patients without NSTEMI.

TI  - Radial artery sclerostin expression in chronic kidney disease stage 5 predialysis
      patients: a cross-sectional observational study.
PG  - 1433-1437
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1604-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel 
      candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. 
      The aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression
      and its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December
      2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous
      fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were
      collected and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by
      immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum
      sclerostin levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries
      was 56.25%. Sclerostin expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum 
      sclerostin levels in patients with positive sclerostin expression were much
      higher than in those with negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analyses including potential confounders as age, gender, systolic
      blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca),
      phosphate (P), Ca x P product, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, 
      and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that only serum sclerostin levels
      were closely related to vessel sclerostin expression (p = 0.025). The area under 
      the curve of serum sclerostin levels for predicting positive vessel sclerostin
      expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity (p = 0.008).
      The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53
      pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Positive expression of sclerostin in the radial artery media 
      layer was related to high serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin may act as both a
      local and systemic regulator involved in vascular calcification.

TI  - Serum Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase-5b Levels are Associated with the
      Severity and Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Coronary Artery 
      Disease.

AB  - AIMS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG)
      are specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated
      with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the
      severity of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor
      outcome in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of
      TRACP-5b on coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear. METHODS: A 
      total of 71 CAD patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0+/-9.7 years) and 28
      age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of
      diseased vessels (a marker of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the
      Gensini score (a marker of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as
      the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels
      were classified into quartiles. RESULTS: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly
      higher in CAD patients than in healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b
      levels had higher OPG levels and Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b
      levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were associated with an increased number of
      diseased vessels. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the OPG
      level and the number of diseased vessels or the Gensini score were significantly 
      and independently associated with the TRACP-5b level. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly associated with the OPG level
      and with the severity and extent of coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients.

TI  - Clinical relevance of aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0218-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical relevance
      of aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients. METHODS: Between January 2010
      and September 2014, 1221 patients with urolithiasis were treated in Oyokyo Kidney
      Research Institute and Hirosaki University Hospital. Among these, 287 patients
      (Stone group) on whom adequate data were available were included in this
      retrospective study. We also selected 148 subjects with early stage (pT1N0M0)
      renal cell carcinoma from 607 renal cell carcinoma patients who underwent radical
      nephrectomy at Hirosaki University Hospital (Non-stone group) as control
      subjects. Validity of the Non-stone group was evaluated by comparison with
      pair-matched 296 volunteers from 1166 subjects who participated in the Iwaki
      Health Promotion Project in 2014. Thereafter, age, body mass index, aortic
      calcification index (ACI), renal function, serum uric acid concentrations, and
      comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease) were compared
      between the Non-stone and Stone groups. Independent factors for higher ACI and
      impaired renal function were assessed using multivariate logistic regression
      analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed relevance of Non-stone group patients as a
      control subject by comparing the pair-matched community-dwelling volunteers.
      Backgrounds of patients between the Non-stone and Stone groups were not
      significantly different except for the presence of hypertension in the Stone
      group. ACI was not significantly high in the Stone group compared with the
      Non-stone group. However, age-adjusted ACI was greater in the Stone group than
      the Non-stone group. Among urolithiasis patients, ACI was significantly higher in
      uric acid containing stone patients. The number of patients with stage 3B chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in the Stone group than in the
      Non-stone group (12% vs. 4%, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression
      analysis showed higher aortic calcification index (>13%), and being a stone
      former were independent factors for stage 3B CKD at the time of diagnosis.
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification and being a stone former had harmful influence
      on renal function. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN:
      UMIN000022962.

TI  - Visceral Adipose Tissue and Leptin Hyperproduction Are Associated With
      Hypogonadism in Men With Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypogonadism is a common endocrine disorder in men with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD), but its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We here explore the 
      plausible contribution of abdominal adiposity and leptin hyperproduction to
      testosterone deficiency in this patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      analysis with all men included the Malnutrition, Inflammation and Vascular
      Calcification cohort, which enrolled consecutive nondialyzed patients with CKD
      stages 3-5. SUBJECTS: A total of 172 men with CKD stages 3-5 nondialysis (median 
      age 61 [45-75] years, median glomerular filtration rate 24 [9-45] mL/min/1.73
      m(2)). In them, serum levels of total testosterone, estrogen, sex hormone binding
      globulin, and leptin were quantified, together with visceral adipose tissue (VAT)
      by thoracic and abdominal CT scan. INTERVENTION: None, observational study. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Total testosterone, hypogonadism. RESULTS: The median level of
      total testosterone was 11.7 (7.3-18.4) nmol/L, with hypogonadism (<10 nmol/L)
      present in 52 (30%) patients. Testosterone-deficient patients presented with
      significantly higher body mass index, waist circumference, and VAT. An inverse
      correlation between testosterone and VAT (rho = -0.25, P = .001) or waist
      circumference (rho = -0.20, P = .008) was found, also after multivariate
      adjustment including sex hormone binding globulin and estrogen. Total
      testosterone was inversely correlated with serum leptin (rho = -0.22, P = .003), 
      and the ratio of leptin/VAT, an index of leptin hyperproduction, was strongly and
      independently associated with the prevalence of hypogonadism in multivariable
      regression analyses. CONCLUSION: Visceral adiposity independently associated with
      lower testosterone levels among men with CKD stage 3-5 nondialysis. The observed 
      link between hyperleptinemia and hypogonadism is in line with previous evidence
      on direct effects of leptin on testosterone production.

TI  - The risk of nephrolithiasis is causally related to inactive matrix Gla protein, a
      marker of vitamin K status: a Mendelian randomization study in a Flemish
      population.
PG  - 514-522
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx014 [doi]
AB  - Background: Vitamin K (VK)-dependent gamma-glutamate carboxylation and serine
      phosphorylation activate matrix Gla protein (MGP) to a potent locally acting
      inhibitor of calcification. Nephrolithiasis represents a process of unwanted
      calcification associated with substantial mortality and high recurrence rates. We
      hypothesized that the risk of nephrolithiasis increases with VK shortage, as
      exemplified by higher plasma levels of desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). 
      Methods: In 1748 randomly recruited Flemish individuals (51.1% women; mean age
      46.8 years), we determined dp-ucMGP and the prevalence of nephrolithiasis at
      baseline (April 1996-February 2015) and its incidence during follow-up until
      March 2016. We estimated the multivariable-adjusted relative risk associated with
      the doubling of dp-ucMGP, using logistic or Cox regression. We did a Mendelian
      randomization analysis using four MGP genotypes as instrumental variables.
      Results: With adjustments applied for sex, age and 24-h urinary volume and
      calcium excretion, the odds of having prevalent nephrolithiasis [n = 144 (8.2%)] 
      associated with dp-ucMGP was 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.64; P =
      0.022]. dp-ucMGP levels were associated (P </= 0.001) with MGP variants
      rs2098435, rs4236 and rs2430692. In the Mendelian analysis, the causal odds ratio
      was 3.82 (95% CI 1.15-12.7; P = 0.029). The incidence of nephrolithiasis over
      12.0 years (median) was 37 cases (0.2%). With similar adjustments as before, the 
      hazard ratio in relation to dp-ucMGP was 2.48 (95% CI 1.71-3.61; P < 0.001).
      Additional adjustment for a nephrolithiasis propensity score produced consistent 
      results. Conclusion: Higher levels of inactive dp-ucMGP may be causally
      associated with the risk of nephrolithiasis. Whether or not VK deficiency plays a
      role in these observations remains to be firmly established.

TI  - Vitamin D: a possible modifying factor linking obesity to vascular calcification 
      in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s12986-017-0181-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for increased cardiovascular disease.
      Whether vitamin D deficiency modifies this association is unclear. Here, we
      examined the association of obesity and vitamin D deficiency with vascular
      calcification score (VCS) in incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 213 ESRD patients. Vitamin D 
      deficiency was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels below 10
      ng/mL, and obesity was defined as a percentage of body fat (PBF) higher than the 
      sex-specific median value in the cohort (>26.8% for men, >36.2% for women). VCS
      was measured by plain radiographic film of the lateral abdomen in the standing
      position. RESULTS: Most ESRD patients (76.6%) had 25(OH)D deficiency at the start
      of dialysis. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency was much higher in obese
      patients than non-obese patients, and it had significant inverse association with
      PBF (r = -0.315, p < 0.001). Abdominal aortic calcification was identified in 104
      (48.9%) patients. VCS was significantly higher in obese population; 2.6 (0-23)
      for all patients, 4.2 (0-23) for obese and 1.0 (0-12) for non-obese patients (p <
      0.001). Interestingly, vitamin D deficiency was associated with greater risk of a
      high VCS, especially in obese population [odds ratio (OR) 3.02, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.09-9.38)], but not with non-obese patients (OR 1.82, 95% CI
      0.56-5.60). CONCLUSION: The magnitude and direction of the association between
      obesity and the risk of vascular calcification may depend on an individual's
      25(OH)D level, a possible representative marker of cardiometabolic disturbance in
      ESRD patients.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among 
      Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.0363 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in
      dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are
      sparse data on the association of CAC with subsequent risk of cardiovascular
      disease and all-cause mortality in this population. Objective: To study the
      prospective association of CAC with risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause 
      mortality among dialysis-naive patients with CKD. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: The prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study recruited 
      adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2
      from 7 clinical centers in the United States. There were 1541 participants
      without cardiovascular disease at baseline who had CAC scores. Exposures:
      Coronary artery calcification was assessed using electron-beam or multidetector
      computed tomography. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of cardiovascular
      disease (including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) and
      all-cause mortality were reported every 6 months and confirmed by medical record 
      adjudication. Results: During an average follow-up of 5.9 years in 1541
      participants aged 21 to 74 years, there were 188 cardiovascular disease events
      (60 cases of myocardial infarction, 120 heart failures, and 27 strokes; patients 
      may have had >1 event) and 137 all-cause deaths. In Cox proportional hazards
      models adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, education level, physical
      activity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level,
      systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive treatment, current cigarette
      smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, C-reactive protein level, hemoglobin
      A1c level, phosphorus level, troponin T level, log N-terminal pro-B-type
      natriuretic peptide level, fibroblast growth factor 23 level, estimated
      glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, the hazard ratios associated with
      per 1 SD log of CAC were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.69; P < .001) for cardiovascular
      disease, 1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-2.02; P = .04) for myocardial infarction, 1.39 (95%
      CI, 1.10-1.76; P = .006) for heart failure, and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94-1.51; P = .15)
      for all-cause mortality. In addition, inclusion of CAC score led to an increase
      in the C statistic of 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.09; P < .001) for predicting
      cardiovascular disease over use of all the above-mentioned established and novel 
      cardiovascular disease risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Coronary artery
      calcification is independently and significantly related to the risks of
      cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in patients with
      CKD. In addition, CAC improves risk prediction for cardiovascular disease,
      myocardial infarction, and heart failure over use of established and novel
      cardiovascular disease risk factors among patients with CKD; however, the changes
      in the C statistic are small.

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown
      to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess
      characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study
      of 124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two
      HD-dependent patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery
      disease were compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age,
      diabetes mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were
      comparable. Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired 
      non-culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen
      area, and area stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had
      greater mean calcium arcs in culprit (54.3 degrees vs 26.4 degrees , p = 0.004)
      and non-culprit lesions (34.3 degrees vs 24.5 degrees , p = 0.02) and greater
      maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments (101.6 degrees vs 0 degrees , p =
      0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. There was a higher
      prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium >30 degrees
      within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs
      4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the
      HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial
      calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study,
      HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more
      extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of
      non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an 
      overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute
      to the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores
      with long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant
      coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients.
PG  - 82

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic
      dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early
      identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce
      mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated
      with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a
      lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a
      lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in
      dialysis patients. METHODS: All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial
      without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this 
      study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the
      abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system 
      whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was
      assessed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 
      67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD.
      AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 
      4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an
      independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per
      point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a
      specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. CONCLUSION: This study
      shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray
      is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in
      asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening
      method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further 
      screening of CAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ;

TI  - Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial calcification score
      in type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s12933-017-0509-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is
      associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest
      that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However,
      metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been
      characterized. The present study investigated the association between metformin
      use and lower-limb arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study
      included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney
      disease. Below-the-knee calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography
      and supplemented by colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs
      were carefully collected from the patients' medical records and during patient
      interviews. Biochemical and clinical data were studied as potential confounding
      factors. RESULTS: Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower
      calcification score than metformin-free patients (mean +/- standard deviation:
      2033 +/- 4514 and 4684 +/- 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis
      showed that metformin was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of
      severe below-the-knee arterial calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly
      associated with the use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas,
      insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use and
      calcification score (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p =
      0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use, renal function, previous
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA1c levels,
      and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use
      was independently associated with a lower below-the-knee arterial calcification
      score. This association may contribute to metformin's well-known vascular
      protective effect. Further prospective investigations of metformin's potential
      ability to inhibit VC in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed
      to confirm these results.

TI  - Aortic calcification burden predicts deterioration of renal function after
      radical nephrectomy.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0202-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a risk factor
      for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the possibility of
      postoperative deterioration of renal function must be considered before surgery. 
      We investigated the contribution of the aortic calcification index (ACI) to the
      prediction of deterioration of renal function in patients undergoing radical
      nephrectomy. METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2012, we performed 511
      consecutive radical nephrectomies for patients with RCC. We retrospectively
      studied data from 109 patients who had regular postoperative follow-up of renal
      function for at least five years. The patients were divided into non-CKD and
      pre-CKD based on a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of
      >/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. The ACI was
      quantitatively measured by abdominal computed tomography before surgery. The
      patients in each group were stratified between low and high ACIs. Variables such 
      as age, sex, comorbidities, and pre- and postoperative renal function were
      compared between patients with a low or high ACI in each group. Renal function
      deterioration-free interval rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
      Factors independently associated with deterioration of renal function were
      determined using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age, preoperative
      eGFR, and ACI in this cohort were 65 years, 68 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 8.3%,
      respectively. Higher ACI (>/=8.3%) was significantly associated with eGFR decline
      in both non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Renal function deterioration-free interval
      rates were significantly lower in the ACI-high than ACI-low strata in both of the
      non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher ACI was an
      independent risk factor for deterioration of renal function at 5 years after
      radical nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic calcification burden is a potential
      predictor of deterioration of renal function after radical nephrectomy. TRIAL

TI  - Calcification in arteriovenous fistula blood vessels may predict arteriovenous
      fistula failure: a 5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 881-887
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1515-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for
      hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival
      remains unclear and results of several studies about this issue are
      controversial. In the light of the new knowledge about the different
      susceptibility for calcification process in different blood vessels, the aim of
      our study was to analyze whether the calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have 
      an impact on AVF longevity. METHODS: The study included 90 patients, 49 males and
      41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a mean age 62 +/- 11 years, on regular
      hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent primary AVFs. Vascular
      calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic region was detected
      using X-ray examination. RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood vessels was found in
      62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male
      gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of AVF before
      calcification determination were associated with calcification of AVF-blood
      vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these standardized
      predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels
      calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of
      3.42 (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications
      of AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may
      jeopardize the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and
      valid method for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which
      should be monitored more closely.

TI  - Vitamin K-Dependent Carboxylation of Matrix Gla Protein Influences the Risk of
      Calciphylaxis.
PG  - 1717-1722
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2016060651 [doi]
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. The
      ability of MGP to inhibit calcification requires the activity of a vitamin
      K-dependent enzyme, which mediates MGP carboxylation. We investigated how MGP
      carboxylation influences the risk of calciphylaxis in adult patients receiving
      dialysis and examined the effects of vitamin K deficiency on MGP carboxylation.
      Our study included 20 patients receiving hemodialysis with calciphylaxis (cases) 
      and 20 patients receiving hemodialysis without calciphylaxis (controls) matched
      for age, sex, race, and warfarin use. Cases had higher plasma levels of
      uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) and carboxylated MGP (cMGP) than controls. However,
      the fraction of total MGP that was carboxylated (relative cMGP concentration =
      cMGP/[cMGP + uncarboxylated MGP]) was lower in cases than in controls
      (0.58+/-0.02 versus 0.69+/-0.03, respectively; P=0.003). In patients not taking
      warfarin, cases had a similarly lower relative cMGP concentration. Each 0.1 unit 
      reduction in relative cMGP concentration associated with a more than two-fold
      increase in calciphylaxis risk. Vitamin K deficiency associated with lower
      relative cMGP concentration in multivariable adjusted analyses (beta=-8.99;
      P=0.04). In conclusion, vitamin K deficiency-mediated reduction in relative cMGP 
      concentration may have a role in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis. Whether
      vitamin K supplementation can prevent and/or treat calciphylaxis requires further
      study.

TI  - Does statins promote vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 137-148
LID - 10.1111/eci.12718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification
      (CAC) and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not
      improve survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular
      calcification is unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory
      biomarkers, statins and mortality in ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients
      with ESRD (63% males; median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients
      of living donor kidney transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 
      prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston
      Units, AUs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality
      were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated in 35 patients after 1.5 years of renal
      replacement therapy. In vitro, human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were
      used to measure vitamin K metabolism. RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had 
      a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors
      of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The 
      association between CAC score and mortality remained significant after adjustment
      for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use of statins, protein-energy wasting and
      inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 patients showed that statin therapy was 
      associated with greater progression of CAC. In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4
      by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score
      is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of inflammation. Future studies
      should resolve if statins promote vascular calcification and inhibition of
      vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

TI  - Plaque surface irregularity and calcification length within carotid plaque
      predict secondary events in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 29-34
LID - S0021-9150(16)31476-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.11.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although comprehensive risk factor modification is
      recommended, a uniform management strategy does not necessarily prevent secondary
      events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, identification 
      of high-risk patients who may benefit from more intensive interventions may
      improve prognosis. Carotid ultrasound can reliably identify systemic
      atherosclerosis, and carotid plaque and intima-media thickness (IMT) are known
      independent risk factors for CAD. However, it is unclear whether findings on
      carotid ultrasound can improve prediction of secondary CAD events. METHODS: The
      study population comprised 146 consecutive patients with CAD (mean age, 66 +/- 9 
      years; 126 with angina pectoris, 20 with acute myocardial infarction). IMT,
      plaque score, plaque area, plaque surface irregularity, and calcification length 
      (calculated by summing the calcified lesions within each plaque accompanied by
      acoustic shadow) were measured at baseline. Patients were followed for 10 years
      to ascertain secondary CAD events defined as hard major adverse cardiovascular
      events (MACE; cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction) and as total MACE
      (hard MACE and angina pectoris with coronary revascularization). RESULTS:
      Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that calcification length (p < 0.05)
      and plaque surface irregularity (p < 0.01) remained independently associated with
      total MACE after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease, smoking, and multivessel CAD. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that the combination of calcification length and plaque
      surface irregularity has additional value beyond traditional risk classification.
      Intensive intervention for these high-risk patients may avoid or delay
      progression of atherosclerosis towards secondary CAD events.

TI  - Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12888 [doi]
AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification 
      score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 
      2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic
      kidney disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal.
      The difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and
      in the external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total
      iliac vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease,
      and diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk
      factor (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total
      iliac vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical
      evaluation protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early
      graft loss due to calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular
      calcification prior to transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical
      decisions and to improve patient safety and outcome in increasingly older
      transplant recipients.

AB  - Gender differences exist in clinical outcomes after routine percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), but studies reporting such outcomes after chronic total
      occlusion (CTO) PCI are limited. We assessed the characteristics and outcomes of 
      female patients undergoing CTO PCI. We retrospectively analyzed a dedicated
      national (United Kingdom) prospective CTO database from 2011 to 2015 for outcomes
      and characteristics of female patients undergoing CTO PCI (unmatched and
      propensity matched). Female patients constituted 20.5% (n = 260 of 1,271) of the 
      unmatched cohort and 33.3% (n = 233 of 699) of the matched cohort and were more
      likely to be older (women aged >70 years, 48% in the unmatched and 45% in the
      matched cohort). An increased inhospital complication rate was observed in female
      patients (unmatched: 10% women vs 4.45% men, p = 0.0012, and matched 9.87% women 
      vs 3.86% men, p = 0.0032). Coronary perforation, bleeding, and contrast-induced
      nephropathy were more frequently observed in female patients. Femoral access site
      with >6 French sheath was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Presence
      of calcification in the CTO artery was associated with coronary perforation
      (grade III) in female patients in the matched cohort (p = 0.007). Female patients
      undergoing CTO PCI were older and experienced increased of inhospital
      complications. Increased awareness of these complications could influence the
      selection of access site and sheath size, the need for prehydration, judicious
      choice of balloon size, collateral selection, and wire placement in female
      patients undergoing CTO PCI.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to low
      bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the
      latter are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary
      artery calcium (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). 
      In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree 
      of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens
      collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the
      patients, 26% had osteopenia and 7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery 
      biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score
      (>100 Agatston units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of
      leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with extensive
      VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of
      leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and
      patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score. Both high CAC and 
      extensive VC were independently predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD has the
      potential to identify ESRD patients at risk of vascular calcification.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), overweight and mild obesity have shown the
      lowest cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, central obesity has been directly
      associated with CV risk in these patients. This bidirectional relationship of
      body mass index (BMI) and central obesity prompted us to evaluate CV risk based
      on a combination of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in nondialysis CKD patients.
      We included 1078 patients with CKD stage 2 through 5 (nondialysis) enrolled in a 
      nationwide prospective cohort of Korea. Patients were divided into 3 groups by
      BMI (normal BMI, 18.5-22.9; overweight, 23.0-27.4; and obese, 27.5 and over
      kg/m(2)) and were dichotomized by a sex-specific median WHR (0.92 in males and
      0.88 in females). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was determined by
      multislice computed tomography. CAC (score above 10 Agatston units) was found in 
      477 patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that BMI was
      not independently associated with CAC. However, WHR showed an independent linear 
      and significant association with CAC (odds ratio, 1.036; 95% confidence interval,
      1.007-1.065 per 0.01 increase). Furthermore, when patients were categorized into 
      6 groups according to a combination of BMI and WHR, normal BMI but higher WHR had
      the highest risk of CAC compared with the normal BMI with lower WHR group (2.104;
      1.074-4.121). Thus, a normal BMI with central obesity was associated with the
      highest risk of CAC, suggesting that considering BMI and WHR, 2 surrogates of
      obesity, can help to discriminate CV risk in Korean nondialysis CKD patients.

      Dysfunction, and Structural Remodeling in a Rat Model of Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 216-229
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with large artery
      remodeling, endothelial dysfunction and calcification, with angiotensin II (Ang
      II) a known driver of these pathologies. We investigated long-term Ang II type 1 
      receptor inhibition with valsartan on aortic function and structure in the Lewis 
      polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of CKD. METHODS: Mixed sex LPK and Lewis
      control (total n = 28) treated (valsartan 60 mg/kg/day p.o. from 4 to 18 weeks)
      and vehicle groups were studied. Functional responses to noradrenaline (NA),
      potassium chloride and endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations were
      investigated in vitro using acetylcholine hydrochloride (ACh) and sodium
      nitroprusside (SNP), respectively. Effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
      substrate L-arginine, NOS inhibitor L-NAME and cyclooxygenase inhibitor
      indomethacin on ACh responses were examined. RESULTS: In the LPK, valsartan
      reduced systolic blood pressure and urinary protein, ameliorated exaggerated
      sensitivity to NA, and normalized endothelium-dependent (ACh-Rmax; 91 +/- 7 vs.
      59 +/- 6%, p = 0.0001) and independent dysfunction (SNP-Rmax; 99 +/- 1 vs. 82 +/-
      7%, p = 0.040), as well as improving NO-dependent relaxation (Rmax; -51 +/- 6 vs.
      -26 +/- 9%, p = 0.008). Valsartan also reduced aortic wall hypertrophy, elastin
      disruption/fragmentation, calcification, media cystic degeneration, and levels of
      matrix metalloproteinase 9. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of Ang II
      in driving vascular manifestations of CKD and indicates that early treatment can 
      significantly limit pathological changes.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in CKD-5D patients is tied to adverse cardiac
      function and increased mortality.
PG  - 291-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with
      chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) and is an important predictor of 
      mortality. However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not
      been well established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases
      mortality by adversely affecting cardiac function. METHODS: Patients were
      recruited from 37 regional dialysis centers. 2-D and Doppler echocardiographic
      analyses were performed, and CAC was measured using 64-slice computed tomography.
      Relationships between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV)
      function were analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow-up of 37 months.
      RESULTS: There were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median
      age was 55 years, and median duration of CKD-5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC
      scores 100 were found in 69% of patients, with 51% having a score 400. CAC was
      associated with measures of LV systolic and diastolic function (global
      longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity
      (rho = -0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV filling pressure (E:E'; rho =
      0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed these relationships after
      adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and coronary artery disease.
      Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). Both LV diastolic and
      systolic functional measures were significant predictors of mortality, the
      strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show
      a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD-5D. LV diastolic
      function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent predictors of
      mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in CKD-5D.
      These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with CKD-5D
      and describe a potentially-valuable role for echocardiography in the routine
      management of these patients..

TI  - A Nationally Representative Study of Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy Risk Factors.
PG  - 3421-3429
AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) 
      is necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We
      investigated whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would
      identify patients at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using
      data from a large dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly
      diagnosed CUA (n=1030) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were
      matched by age, sex, and race in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA
      (n=2060). Mean ages for patients and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively;
      67% of participants were women and 49% were white. Median duration between
      hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA development was 925 days
      (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable conditional logistic
      regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; higher levels of 
      serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and nutritional vitamin D,
      cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with increased odds of
      subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes receiving no
      insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a dose-response
      increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh areas
      (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for
      more than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship
      between recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months
      to years before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of 
      preventive strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Predictors of atherosclerotic events in patients on haemodialysis: post hoc
      analyses from the AURORA study.
PG  - 102-112
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfw360 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients on haemodialysis (HD) are at high risk for cardiovascular
      events, but heart failure and sudden death are more common than atherosclerotic
      events. The A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatinin in Subjects on Regular 
      Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) trial 
      was designed to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction and
      death from any cardiac cause in 2773 HD patients. We studied predictors of the
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in AURORA. Methods: We readjudicated all
      deaths and presumed myocardial infarctions according to the criteria used in the 
      Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP); these were specifically developed to
      separate atherosclerotic from non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. The
      readjudicated atherosclerotic end point included the first event of the
      following: non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease,
      non-fatal and fatal non-haemorrhagic stroke, coronary revascularization
      procedures and death from ischaemic limb disease. Stepwise Cox regression
      analysis was used to identify the predictors of such events. Results: During a
      mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 506 patients experienced the new composite
      atherosclerotic outcome. Age, male sex, prevalent diabetes, prior cardiovascular 
      disease, weekly dialysis duration, baseline albumin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.96; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99 per g/L increase], high-sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04-1.22 per mg/L increase) and oxidized low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03-1.17 per 10 U/L increase)
      were selected as significant predictors in the model. Neither LDL cholesterol nor
      allocation to placebo/rosuvastatin therapy predicted the outcome. Conclusions:
      Even with the use of strict criteria for end point definition, non-traditional
      risk factors, but not lipid disturbances, predicted atherosclerotic events in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of vascular calcification in pre-dialysis patients
      with Balkan endemic nephropathy.
PG  - 608-14
AB  - Introduction: Vascular calcifications (VC) are common in patients with chronic
      kidney disease and present one of manifestations of mineral and bone disorders in
      these patients. Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the
      prevalence and risk factors of VC in pre-dialysis patients with Balkan endemic
      nephropathy (BEN) and other kidney diseases. Methods: The study involved 32
      pre-dialysis patients, 15 with BEN and 17 with other kidney diseases. All the
      patients underwent an interview, objective examination, routine laboratory
      analyses and measurement of serum concentration of intact parathyroid hormone
      (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and osteopontin. VCs in iliac, femoral,
      radial, and digital arteries were evaluated and Adragao VC score was calculated. 
      The samples of radial artery were collected during the first creation of an
      arteriovenous fistula, and expression of osteocalcin, bone morphogenic protein-2 
      osteopontin, and matrix Gla-protein in arterial wall were examined. Results:
      Patients with BEN were significantly older (71.1 +/- 6.1 vs. 54.7 +/- 11.1
      years), but they had significantly lower systolic and mean blood pressure (95.7
      +/- 13.2 mmHg vs. 104.3 +/- 7.4 mmHg) and lower serum concentration of phosphorus
      (1.32 +/- 0.36 mmol/l vs. 1.65 +/- 0.35 mmol/l) and cholesterol (4.3 +/- 1.1
      mmol/l vs. 5.2 +/- 0.8 mmol/l) than patients with other kidney diseases. Mean VC 
      score was significantly lower in patients with BEN than in those with other
      kidney diseases (2.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 4.6 +/- 1.8; p = 0.009), but expression of four 
      examined proteins in arterial wall differed insignificantly between the two
      groups. VC score correlated significantly with serum concentrations of
      cholesterol, triglycerides (positively), and iPTH (negatively). Conclusion:
      Pre-dialysis BEN patients had a significantly lower mean score of VC than
      patients with other kidney diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors associated with
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommendations
      concerning screening for VC differ. Possible ability to prevent and reversibility
      of VC are major subjects on debate whether screening for VC could improve
      outcomes of renal patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the
      significance of simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) based on plane
      radiographic films and to test its association with non-fatal cardiovascular
      events in patients on chronic HD. METHODS: A study population consisted of 95
      prevalent HD patients in the HD unit of Hospital of Lithuanian University of
      Health sciences Kaunas Clinics. Clinical data and laboratory tests information
      were collected from medical records. SVCS was evaluated as it is described by
      Adragao et al. After measurement of VC, HD patients were observed for novel
      non-fatal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: 
      SVCS>/=3 (57 patients [60%]) and <3 (38 patients [40%]). The Kaplan-Meier
      survival curves show a significant difference in non-fatal cardiovascular events 
      in the group with SVCS>/=3 vs. <3 group (26.3% vs. 7.8%; log rank 5,49; P=0.018).
      Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed a negative impact of VC,
      hyperphosphatemia, and lower ejection fraction on cardiovascular events. No
      statistically significant differences were observed comparing parameters of Ca-P 
      metabolism disorders between groups with different SVCS. On separate analysis,
      the presence of VC in hands was also associated with higher rate of novel
      cardiovascular events (score 0 goup-5 events [10.6%] vs. score>/=1 group-13
      events [27%], log rank P=0.035). CONCLUSION: VC assessed by simple and
      inexpensive radiological method was an independent predictor of novel non-fatal
      cardiovascular events in HD patients.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause and mortality
      in dialysis patients: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 35375
LID - 10.1038/srep35375 [doi]
AB  - Studies on aortic arch calcification (AAC) and mortality risk in maintenance
      dialysis patients have yielded conflicting findings. We conducted this
      meta-analysis to investigate the association between the presence of AAC and
      cardiovascular or all-cause and mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients. 
      Observational studies evaluating baseline AAC and cardiovascular or all-cause
      mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients were searched through the PubMed 
      and Embase, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang databases until January 2016. A total of 8
      studies with 3,256 dialysis patients were identified. Compared with patients
      without AAC, the presence of AAC was associated with greater risk of
      cardiovascular mortality (hazard risk [HR] 2.30; 95% confidence intervals [CI]
      1.78-2.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.19-1.75). Subgroup analyses
      indicated that the pooled HR for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was 2.31 
      (95% CI 1.57-3.40) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.96) for the grade 2/3 AAC. Peritoneal 
      dialysis patients with AAC had greater cardiovascular (HR 3.93 vs. HR 2.10) and
      all-cause mortality (HR 2.36 vs. HR 1.33) than hemodialysis patients. The AAC
      appears to be independently associated with excessive cardiovascular and
      all-cause mortality in maintenance dialysis patients. Regular follow-up AAC might
      be helpful to stratify mortality risk in dialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have been
      associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there is no
      accepted standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications, and most
      existing methods are simplistic. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis
      that a semiquantitative score, one that accounts for all visible calcium on
      echocardiography, could predict all-cause mortality and stroke in a graded
      fashion. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects
      derived from a general echocardiography database. A global cardiac calcium score 
      (GCCS) was applied that assigned points for calcification in the aortic root and 
      valve, mitral annulus and valve, and submitral apparatus, and points for
      restricted leaflet mobility. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the
      secondary outcome was stroke. RESULTS: Over a mean 3.8 +/- 1.7 years of
      follow-up, there were 116 deaths and 34 strokes. Crude mortality increased in a
      graded fashion with increasing GCCS. In unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, 
      the GCCS was significantly associated with total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26;
      95% CI, 1.17-1.35; P < .0001) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; 
      P = .003). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (age, gender,
      body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of
      coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, history of atrial fibrillation, and
      history of stroke), these associations remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The
      GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired echocardiograms and has clinically
      significant associations with total mortality and stroke.

TI  - Higher serum sclerostin levels and insufficiency of vitamin D are strongly
      associated with vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients: a case control
      study.
PG  - 577-584
LID - 10.1007/s00198-016-3770-9 [doi]
AB  - In hemodialysis patients, vertebral fractures were associated with elevated
      sclerostin levels, suggesting that sclerostin could reflect bone fragility in
      these patients. INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are common in hemodialysis
      patients. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of vertebral
      fracture and analyze associations between sclerostin serum levels and vertebral
      fractures in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Ninety-two hemodialysis patients and
      100 controls matched for age and sex were studied. Bone mineral density was
      measured by ultrasonography at non-dominant heel. The markers of bone turnover
      included serum osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide, and sclerostin. All
      participants underwent radiography of the thoracic and lumbar spine to ascertain 
      the presence of vertebral fractures. RESULTS: Bone ultrasound parameters at
      calcaneus were significantly lower in hemodialysis patients compared with
      controls; bone turnover markers and parathyroid hormone level were significantly 
      higher, while serum of 25-OH-D3 was significantly lower in hemodialysis group.
      One or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures were found in 38 hemodialysis 
      patients, whereas in control group, 10 patients had a vertebral fracture. In
      hemodialysis group, the comparison between patients with and without vertebral
      fractures showed that the patients with vertebral fractures had the serum
      sclerostin levels statistically higher than patients without vertebral, while
      serum levels of 25-OH-D3 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral
      fractures compared to the patients without vertebral fractures. Multivariate
      analysis disclosed that sclerostin levels were associated with an increased risk 
      of vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients after adjusting for multiple
      variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows high prevalence of vertebral fractures in 
      hemodialysis patients and that it is associated with elevated sclerostin levels, 
      reflecting bone fragility in these patients.

TI  - Parathyroid ultrasonography and bone metabolic profile of patients on dialysis
      with hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 437-47
LID - 10.5527/wjn.v5.i5.437 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the parathyroid ultrasonography and define parameters that can
      predict poor response to treatment in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism
      due to renal failure. METHODS: This cohort study evaluated 85 patients with
      chronic kidney disease stage V with parathyroid hormone levels above 800 pg/mL.
      All patients underwent ultrasonography of the parathyroids and the following
      parameters were analyzed: Demographic characteristics (etiology of chronic kidney
      disease, gender, age, dialysis vintage, vascular access, use of vitamin D),
      laboratory (calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, bone 
      alkaline phosphatase), and the occurrence of bone changes, cardiovascular events 
      and death. The chi(2) test were used to compare proportions or the Fisher exact
      test for small sample frequencies. Student t-test was used to detect differences 
      between the two groups regarding continuous variables. RESULTS: Fifty-three
      patients (66.4%) had parathyroid nodules with higher levels of parathyroid
      hormone, calcium and phosphorus. Sixteen patients underwent parathyroidectomy and
      had higher levels of phosphorus and calcium x phosphorus product (P = 0.03 and P 
      = 0.006, respectively). They also had lower mortality (32% vs 68%, P = 0.01) and 
      lower incidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (27% vs 73%, P =
      0.02). Calcium x phosphorus product above 55 mg(2)/dL(2) [RR 1.48 (1.06, 2.08), P
      = 0.03], presence of vascular calcification [1.33 (1.01, 1.76), P = 0.015] and
      previous occurrence of vascular events [RR 2.25 (1.27, 3.98), P < 0.001] were
      risk factors for mortality in this population. There was no association between
      the occurrence of nodules and mortality. CONCLUSION: The identification of
      nodules at ultrasonography strengthens the indication for parathyroidectomy in
      patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.

TI  - Association of Ankle-Brachial Index and Aortic Arch Calcification with Overall
      and Cardiovascular Mortality in Hemodialysis.
PG  - 33164
LID - 10.1038/srep33164 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral artery occlusive disease and vascular calcification are highly
      prevalent in hemodialysis (HD) patients, however the association of the
      combination of ankle-brachial index (ABI) and aortic arch calcification (AoAC)
      with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing HD is unknown. In this study, we
      investigated whether the combination of ABI and AoAC is independently associated 
      with overall and cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. The median follow-up
      period was 5.7 years. Calcification of the aortic arch was assessed by chest
      X-ray. Forty-seven patients died including 24 due to cardiovascular causes during
      the follow-up period. The study patients were stratified into four groups
      according to an ABI < 0.95 or >/=0.95 and an AoAC score of >4 or </=4 according
      to receiver operating characteristic curve. Those with an ABI < 0.95 and AoAC > 4
      (vs. ABI >/= 0.95 and AoAC score </= 4) were associated with overall (hazard
      ratio [HR], 4.913; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.932 to 12.497; p = 0.001) and 
      cardiovascular (HR, 3.531; 95% CI, 1.070 to 11.652; p = 0.038) mortality in
      multivariable analysis. The combination of a low ABI and increased AoAC was
      associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients
      undergoing HD.

TI  - ORBIT II sub-analysis: Impact of impaired renal function following treatment of
      severely calcified coronary lesions with the Orbital Atherectomy System.
PG  - 841-848
LID - 10.1002/ccd.26778 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the coronary Orbital
      Atherectomy System (OAS) to prepare severely calcified lesions for stent
      deployment in patients grouped by renal function. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) of severely calcified lesions is associated with
      increased rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death,
      myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared
      with PCI of non-calcified vessels. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are
      at increased risk for MACE after PCI. The impact of CKD on coronary orbital
      atherectomy treatment has not been well characterized. METHODS: ORBIT II was a
      prospective, multicenter trial in the U.S., which enrolled 443 patients with
      severely calcified coronary lesions. The MACE rate was defined as a composite of 
      cardiac death, MI, and target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Of the 441
      patients enrolled with known estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values
      at baseline, 333 (75.5%) patients had eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 108 patients
      had eGFR >/= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) . The mean eGFR at baseline in the eGFR < 90
      ml/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR >/= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) groups was 65.0 +/- 0.9
      ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 109.1 +/- 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) , respectively. Freedom from 
      MACE was lower in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) group at 30 days (87.4% vs.
      96.3%, P = 0.02) and 1-year (80.6% vs. 90.7%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      with renal impairment had a higher MACE rate through one year follow-up due to a 
      higher rate of periprocedural MI. Interestingly, the rates of cardiac death and
      revascularization through 1-year were similar in patients with eGFR < 90
      ml/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR >/= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) . Future studies are needed to 
      identify the ideal revascularization strategy for patients with renal impairment 
      and severely calcified coronary lesions. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - [Iron-based Phosphate Binders for ESRD Patients].
LID - gin/33.4.13 [pii]
AB  - Several factors influence the choice of phosphate binder for patients, including 
      older age, male gender, post-menopause, diabetes, low bone turnover,
      vascular/valvular calcification and inflammation. Unlike calcium-based phosphate 
      binders, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, such as sevelamer and lanthanum
      carbonate, have been able to reduce the progression of bone disease to adynamic
      bone among patients with CKD. New iron-based phosphate binders are now available.
      With multiple options available for the reduction of phosphate, the focus has
      been on agents that do not contain calcium. This is because it is thought that
      calcium itself functions as a substrate for calcification.

TI  - Vertebral bone density associates with coronary artery calcification and is an
      independent predictor of poor outcome in end-stage renal disease patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major
      complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density
      (BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated
      associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery
      calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD
      quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with
      mortality. METHODS: In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56years, 63% males)
      comprising incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and
      recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC
      scores (Agatston units, AUs) were quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the
      patients, BMD was measured by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation
      biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed. RESULTS: Patients
      with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 and CAC score. Low VBD was
      independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) after adjustment for
      age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards
      analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause mortality after
      adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and subjective global
      assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) showed a good 
      degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more
      strongly associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD
      evaluated from DXA. CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed
      good degree of agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD
      were stronger than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent
      associations of low VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest 
      that VBD may serve as an important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian
      patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF). METHODS:
      Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. Predictors of
      patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier
      survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency rates.
      RESULTS: Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months,
      58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months.
      Univariate analysis showed that factors which predict for patency include male
      gender (p = 0.003), good diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031),
      pre-dialysis status (p = 0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and
      non-calcified radial arteries (p = 0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein
      diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 0.472) did not predict for primary
      AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the male gender to be an independent 
      predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). Subset analysis showed a
      significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 mm amongst males, as
      compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no statistical difference in
      the average cephalic vein diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Within our Asian study
      population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36
      months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Male gender is
      an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. In females or patients with calcified
      radial arteries, a more proximal AVF should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vascular calcification can predict cardiovascular (CV)
      morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated
      the prevalence, association factors, and outcomes of chest X-ray-detected aortic 
      arch calcification (AoAC) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).
      METHODS: We included 190 patients undergoing PD (mean age, 52.6 +/- 14.3 years)
      for whom chest radiographs were available. AoAC revealed by chest X-ray was
      graded from 0 to 3 according to an AoAC score (AoACS). Multiple regression
      analyses were used to determine the factors associated with AoACS. After
      adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, mean blood pressure, and 
      history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading and mortality were
      assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS:
      Age (p < 0.001), PD duration (p = 0.004), history of CV disease (p < 0.001), and 
      renal Kt/V (p = 0.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean follow-up of 55.1
      +/- 32.1 months, patients with Grade 2 (p = 0.011) or Grade 3 (p < 0.001) AoAC
      had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In addition,
      patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than those with
      Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (p = 0.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.736; 95%
      confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; p = 0.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HR = 3.289;
      95% CI, 1.156-9.359; p = 0.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality
      after adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HR = 36.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; 
      p = 0.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment.
      CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing PD, CXR-detected severe AoAC was an
      independent risk factor for all-cause and CV mortalities.

TI  - [Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone
      disorder].
PG  - 442-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney
      disease in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone
      disorder (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic
      patients on hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher
      prevalence of severe and progressive vascular calcification with increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main factor which causes vascular
      calcification in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic
      control. The recent trial findings describe an inverse correlation between intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels and glycemic control in a group of
      diabetic patients on hemodialysis. AIM: The objective of the proposed project is 
      to access the difference of the laboratory markers MBD in the group of patients
      with 3rd stage DKD depending on glycemic control. We focused on the relationship 
      between the glycemic compensation of diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level.
      PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 3rd stage DKD were investigated.
      There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), average age of patients was
      71.2 +/- 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 +/- 30 mumol/l and estimated
      glomerular filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 +/- 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 patients with
      better glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with poorly
      controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups.
      Patients were further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH 
      (iPTH < 35 pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical
      analysis was performed using and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We have found the
      statistical significance in the serum phosphate and proteinuria levels in between
      groups with HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 %. Diabetics with better
      glycemic control had significant reduction in serum phosphate level (1.14 +/-
      0.20 vs 1.23 +/- 0.18 mmol/l, p = 0.038) and in 24 hrs proteinuria level (0.56
      +/- 1.35 vs 1.30 +/- 1.61 g/day, p = 0.007). In the group of presumed low bone
      turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found the trend towards increased serum
      calcium level (2.49 +/- 0.12 vs 2.43 +/- 0.10 mmol/l, p = 0.063) and increased
      HbA1c value (7.5 +/- 1.8 vs 6.4 +/- 1.6 %, p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Our results
      suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control of diabetes and
      mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD. KEY WORDS: diabetes mellitus type
      2 (DM2T) - chronic kidney disease (CKD) - mineral and bone disorder (MBD).

TI  - Cardiac Assessment of Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Median 10 Years After
      Successful Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney Transplantation Compared With Living 
      Donor Kidney Transplantation.
PG  - 1261-1267
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recipients with type 1 diabetes, we aimed to determine whether
      long-term normoglycemia achieved by successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney
      (SPK) transplantation could beneficially affect progression of coronary artery
      disease (CAD) when compared with transplantation of a kidney-alone from a living 
      donor (LDK). METHODS: In 42 kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts 
      who had received either SPK (n = 25) or LDK (n = 17), we studied angiographic
      progression of CAD between baseline (pretransplant) and follow-up at 7 years or
      older. In addition, computed tomography scans for measures of coronary artery
      calcification and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic
      function were addressed at follow-up. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 
      10.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 9.1-11.5) progression of CAD occurred at
      similar rates (10 of 21 cases in the SPK and 5 of 14 cases in the LDK group; P = 
      0.49). Median coronary artery calcification scores were high in both groups (1767
      [IQR, 321-4035] for SPK and 1045 [IQR, 807-2643] for LDK patients; P = 0.59).
      Left ventricular systolic function did not differ between the 2 groups. The SPK
      and LDK recipients were similar in age (41.2 +/- 6.9 years vs 40.5 +/- 10.3
      years; P = 0.80) and diabetes duration at engraftment but with significant
      different mean HbA1c levels of 5.5 +/- 0.4% for SPK and 8.3 +/- 1.5% for LDK
      patients (P < 0.001) during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with both type 1 
      diabetes and end-stage renal disease, SPK recipients had similar progression of
      CAD long-term compared with LDK recipients. Calcification of coronary arteries is
      a prominent feature in both groups long-term posttransplant.

TI  - Sclerostin as a new key factor in vascular calcification in chronic kidney
      disease stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 2043-2050
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of the Wnt pathway and
      has been shown to play a key role in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone
      disorder (CKD-MBD). The present study aimed to validate its potential as a
      predictor of vascular calcification in patients with CKD stages 3-4. METHODS: A
      total of 97 patients with CKD stages 3-4 were enrolled in this cross-sectional
      study. Routine clinical biochemistry tests and assays for sclerostin and mineral 
      metabolism markers were performed. Additionally, vascular calcification was
      assessed by multislice spiral computed tomography. Logistic regression analyses
      were used to study the relationships between sclerostin and vascular
      calcification. RESULTS: Serum sclerostin levels (30.8 +/- 6.4 vs. 41.7 +/- 12.6
      pmol/L, P < 0.05) were significantly elevated in patients with CKD stage 3a
      compared to in controls and increased with the decline in glomerular filtration
      rates. Furthermore, patients with vascular calcification had higher serum
      sclerostin levels. Patients with sclerostin levels above the median value had
      increased the prevalence of vascular calcification. Multivariate analysis
      revealed that sclerostin levels were positively associated with vascular
      calcification. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that sclerostin levels are elevated 
      in patients with CKD and are associated with vascular calcification. Therefore,
      sclerostin may be used as a predictor of vascular calcification in the clinical
      setting.

TI  - Alkalosis and Dialytic Clearance of Phosphate Increases Phosphatase Activity: A
      Hidden Consequence of Hemodialysis.
PG  - e0159858
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0159858 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular pyrophosphate is a potent endogenous inhibitor of
      vascular calcification, which is degraded by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
      generated by hydrolysis of ATP via ectonucleotide
      pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). ALP activity (as routinely measured 
      in clinical practice) represents the maximal activity (in ideal conditions), but 
      not the real activity (in normal or physiological conditions). For the first
      time, the present study investigated extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism
      during hemodialysis sessions (including its synthesis via eNPP1 and its
      degradation via ALP) in physiological conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 45
      patients in hemodialysis were studied. Physiological ALP activity represents only
      4-6% of clinical activity. ALP activity increased post-hemodialysis by 2% under
      ideal conditions (87.4 +/- 3.3 IU/L vs. 89.3 +/- 3.6 IU/L) and 48% under
      physiological conditions (3.5 +/- 0.2 IU/L vs. 5.2 +/- 0.2 IU/L). Pyrophosphate
      synthesis by ATP hydrolysis remained unaltered post-hemodialysis.
      Post-hemodialysis plasma pH (7.45 +/- 0.02) significantly increased compared with
      the pre-dialysis pH (7.26 +/- 0.02). The slight variation in pH (~0.2 units)
      induced a significant increase in ALP activity (9%). Addition of phosphate in
      post-hemodialysis plasma significantly decreased ALP activity, although this
      effect was not observed with the addition of urea. Reduction in phosphate levels 
      and increment in pH were significantly associated with an increase in
      physiological ALP activity post-hemodialysis. A decrease in plasma pyrophosphate 
      levels (3.3 +/- 0.3 mumol/L vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 mumol/L) and pyrophosphate/ATP ratio 
      (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.1) post-hemodialysis was also observed. CONCLUSION:
      Extraction of uremic toxins, primarily phosphate and hydrogen ions, dramatically 
      increases the ALP activity under physiological conditions. This hitherto unknown 
      consequence of hemodialysis suggests a reinterpretation of the clinical value of 
      this parameter.

TI  - Serum phosphorus is related to left ventricular remodeling independent of renal
      function in hospitalized patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 134-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.06.181 [doi]
LID - S0167-5273(16)31181-0 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicated that phosphorus emerged as an important
      cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The
      fact that serum phosphorus was closely linked to vascular and valvar
      calcification may account for one important reason. However, left ventricular
      remodeling may also serve as another potential mechanism of the cardiac toxicity 
      of phosphorus. In the present study, we evaluated the association of serum
      phosphorus with left ventricular remodeling. METHODS: We investigated consecutive
      hospitalized patients with pre-dialysis CKD, who did not have symptomatic heart
      failure or take any phosphorus binder or calcitriol medications. Transthoracic
      echocardiography was applied to assess their left ventricular remodeling indices,
      both structural and functional. RESULTS: The 296 study subjects (mean age
      56.4years) included 169 (57.1%) men, 203 (68.6%) hypertensive patients. In
      addition to gender, systolic blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, serum phosphorus was an independent determinant of left ventricular mass
      index (LVMI, P=0.001). Similarly, serum phosphorus was also a determinant of left
      ventricular end diastolic dimension (P=0.0003), but not of relative wall
      thickness. In multivariate logistic analyses, serum phosphorus was significantly 
      and independently associated with the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy 
      (LVH, odds ratio [OR] 2.38 for each 1mmol/L increase, 95% CI 1.20-4.75, P=0.01). 
      Moreover, the association was only confirmatory in eccentric LVH (OR 3.01, 95% CI
      1.43-6.32, P=0.003) but not in concentric LVH (1.38, 95% CI, 0.54-3.49, P=0.50). 
      CONCLUSION: Serum phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with 
      LVMI and the prevalence of eccentric LVH in hospitalized patients with CKD.

TI  - Relationship between Fetuin A, Vascular Calcification and Fracture Risk in
      Dialysis Patients.
PG  - e0158789
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0158789 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures are a common morbidity that lead to worse outcomes in
      dialysis patients. Fetuin A inhibits vascular calcification (VC), potentially
      promotes bone mineralization and its level positively correlates with bone
      mineral density in the general population. On the other hand, the presence of VC 
      is associated with low bone volume in dialysis patients. Whether the fetuin A
      level and VC can predict the occurrence of fractures in dialysis patients remains
      unknown. METHODS: We performed this prospective, observational cohort study
      including 685 dialysis patients (629 hemodialysis and 56 peritoneal dialysis)
      from a single center in Taiwan for a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. The
      baseline fetuin A level and status of presence of aortic arch calcification (VC) 
      and incidence of major fractures (hip, pelvis, humerus, proximal forearm, lower
      leg or vertebrae) were assessed using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models,
      recursive partitioning analysis and competing risk models. RESULTS: Overall, 177 
      of the patients had major fractures. The incidence rate of major fractures was
      3.29 per 100 person-years. In adjusted analyses, the patients with higher
      baseline fetuin A levels had a lower incidence of fractures (adjusted hazard
      ratio (HR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.180.5, fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and HR, 0.52; 
      95% CI, 0.340.78, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1). The presence of aortic arch
      calcification (VC) independently predicted the occurrence of fractures (adjusted 
      HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.342.84) as well. When accounting for death as an event in
      competing risk models, the patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels remained
      to have a lower incidence of fractures (SHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.170.56, fetuin A
      tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and 0.51; 95% CI, 0.320.81, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1).
      INTERPRETATIONS: Lower baseline fetuin A levels and the presence of VC were
      independently linked to higher risk of incident fractures in prevalent dialysis
      patients.

TI  - Low versus high dialysate calcium concentration in alternate night nocturnal
      hemodialysis: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 19-28
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12452 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal
      hemodialysis (NHD) (>/=6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what
      the optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We
      aimed to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC)
      dialysate on cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population. METHODS: A
      randomized controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L,
      n = 24) or HC dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change 
      in mineral metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular
      calcification (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral
      arteries (SFA)), pulse wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 12 months. FINDINGS: In the LC group,
      pre-dialysis ionised calcium decreased -0.12 mmol/L (-0.18-0.06, P = 0.0001) and 
      PTH increased 16 pmol/L (3.5-28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no
      significant change in the HC group. In both groups, there was no progression of
      VC in AA or SFA and no change in PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics
      were prescribed in a higher percentage in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) 
      with a lower proportion of the HC group being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs.
      72%). DISCUSSION: Although dialysate calcium prescription influenced biochemical 
      parameters it was not associated with difference in progression of VC between HC 
      and LC groups. An important finding was the potential impact of alternate night
      NHD in attenuating progression of VC and inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification scores improve contrast-induced nephropathy risk
      assessment in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1298-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of CAC scores
      for the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac
      catheterization in non-dialyzed CKD patients. METHODS: The present study
      evaluated a total of 140 CKD patients who underwent cardiac catheterization.
      Patients were stratified into two groups based on the optimal cut-off value of
      the CAC score, which was graded by a non-triggered, routine diagnostic chest
      computed tomography scan: CAC score >/=8 (high CAC group); and CAC score <8 (low 
      CAC group). CIN was defined as an increase of >10 % in the baseline serum
      cystatin C level at 24 h after contrast administration. RESULTS: The mean
      estimated glomerular filtration rate levels were 41.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the
      mean contrast dose administered was 37.5 mL. Patients with high CAC scores
      exhibited a higher incidence of CIN than patients with low CAC scores (25.5 vs.
      3.2 %, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment for confounders, the CAC score
      predicted CIN (odds ratio 1.68, 95 % confidence interval 1.28-2.21, p < 0.001).
      Moreover, the C-index for CIN prediction significantly increased when the CAC
      scores were added to the Mehran risk score (0.855 vs. 0.760, p = 0.023).
      CONCLUSION: CAC scores, as evaluated using semi-quantitative methods, are a
      simple and powerful predictor of CIN. Incorporating the CAC score in the Mehran
      risk score significantly improved the predictive ability to predict CIN
      incidence.

TI  - Impact of chronic kidney disease stages on atherosclerotic plaque components on
      optical coherence tomography in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 216-224
LID - 10.1007/s12928-016-0408-y [doi]
AB  - The progression of coronary atherosclerosis has been influenced by the presence
      of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the impact of CKD stages
      on coronary plaque components observed on optical coherence tomography (OCT). We 
      investigated 296 native coronary lesions with stable angina pectoris treated with
      stent implantation. All lesions were divided into the three groups according to
      the values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)):
      the non-CKD group (eGFR >/=60, n = 142), CKD group (15 </= eGFR < 60, n = 126),
      and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) group (eGFR <15 and/or hemodialysis, n = 28).
      Among the groups, plaque morphologies at the narrowest culprit sites on OCT were 
      evaluated. The CKD group had a larger lipid arc [207.5 (88.3-264.5) vs. 159.3
      (73.3-227.7) degrees, P = 0.037] and longer lipid length [2.4 (0.0-5.7) vs. 0.0
      (0.0-4.7) mm, P = 0.017] than the non-CKD group. The ESKD group had a thinner
      fibrous cap [120 (70-258) vs. 170 (100-270) mum, P = 0.044], higher prevalence of
      plaque rupture (28.6 vs. 12.3 %, P = 0.038), and larger calcification arc [124.8 
      (0.0-194.3) vs. 0.0 (0.0-125.4) degrees, P = 0.025] than the non-ESKD group (CKD 
      + non-CKD groups). The presence of CKD was related to the growth of lipidic
      plaques. Furthermore, the advancement in the CKD stage to ESKD affected the
      occurrence of plaque rupture or progression of calcification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the association between abdominal aortic
      calcification (AAC) and renal function of living kidney donors and evaluate AAC
      as a surrogate marker for nephrosclerosis. METHODS: Between January 2010 and
      March 2013, 287 donors who underwent living donor nephrectomy were enrolled. We
      analyzed computed tomography angiographies and quantified AAC scores by
      calculating the Agatston score for the abdominal aorta. The donors were
      stratified into the non-AAC group (AAC score = 0; n = 238) and the AAC group (AAC
      score >0; n = 49). The relationship between AAC and perioperative estimated
      glomerular filtration rate was analyzed. For the 180 donors consenting to
      implantation biopsy, the nephrosclerosis score was defined as the sum of
      abnormalities, including glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial
      fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis. RESULTS: The mean AAC score was 185.5 +/- 263.3
      in the AAC group. The AAC group was older than the non-AAC group (51.1 +/- 6.1 vs
      37.9 +/- 11 years; P < .001). Perioperative renal function was not different
      between the 2 groups. However, among the AAC group, donors with an AAC score of
      >100 were associated with delayed renal function recovery (P = .035). Donors with
      AAC were more likely to have glomerulosclerosis (50.0% vs 29.1%; P = .022),
      tubular atrophy (62.5% vs 33.1%; P = .002), and a higher nephrosclerosis score (P
      = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Living donors with an AAC score of >100 require close
      observation because they have a higher probability of delayed renal function
      recovery after donation. AAC is associated with nephrosclerosis in healthy
      adults.

TI  - Surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in
      patients with renal dysfunction and/or aortic arch calcification.
PG  - 444-447
AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors recently reported that the presence of chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and/or extended abdominal aortic calcification was associated with 
      significantly worse clinical outcomes after posterior lumbar interbody fusion.
      CKD is one of the highest risk factors for systemic atherosclerosis. Therefore,
      impaired blood flow due to atherosclerosis could exacerbate degeneration of the
      cervical spine and neural tissue. However, there has been no report of a study
      evaluating the deleterious effects of CKD and atherosclerosis on the outcomes
      after decompression surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. The purpose of
      this study was thus to examine whether CKD and systemic atherosclerosis affect
      surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
      METHODS The authors analyzed data from 127 consecutive cases involving patients
      who underwent laminoplasty for CSM and met their inclusion criteria. Stage 3-4
      CKD was present as a preoperative comorbidity in 44 cases. Clinical status was
      assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) cervical myelopathy
      evaluation questionnaire before surgery and 2 years postoperatively. As a marker 
      of systemic atherosclerosis, the presence of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) was
      assessed on preoperative chest radiographs. RESULTS AoAC was found on
      preoperative chest radiographs in 40 of 127 patients. Neither CKD nor AoAC had a 
      statistically significant deleterious effect on preoperative JOA score. However, 
      CKD and AoAC were significantly associated with reductions in both the JOA score 
      recovery rate (mean 36.1% in patients with CKD vs 44.7% in those without CKD;
      26.0% in patients with AoAC vs 48.9% in those without AoAC) and the change in JOA
      score at 2 years after surgery (mean 2.3 points in patients with CKD vs 3.1
      points in those without CKD; 2.1 points for patients with AoAC vs 3.2 points for 
      those without AoAC). A multivariate regression analysis showed that AoAC was a
      significant independent predictor of poor outcome with respect to both for the
      difference between follow-up and preoperative JOA scores and the JOA score
      recovery rate. CONCLUSIONS CKD and AoAC were associated with increased rates of
      poor neurological outcomes after laminoplasty for CSM, and AoAC was a significant
      independent predictive factor for poor outcome.

TI  - Vascular calcification and intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients:
      Clinical relevance and impact on morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) and intradialytic hypotension (IDH)
      indicate morphological and functional disorders of the cardiovascular system in
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, their relationship and combined effects on
      clinical outcomes remain undetermined. METHODS: HD patients (n=443) whose plain
      chest radiographs were examined for aortic arch VC were included. IDH was defined
      as nadir systolic blood pressure <90mmHg or need for bolus fluid. We investigated
      the relationship between VC and IDH, and their clinical significance for
      cardiovascular events (CVEs) and death. RESULTS: VC was found in 57 HD patients
      (12.9%). IDH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without
      VC (35.1% vs. 18.7%; P=0.004). VC was independently associated with a 2.12-fold
      increase in the risk of IDH (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.36). In
      multivariate analysis, compared with patients with neither VC nor IDH, the
      coexistence of VC and IDH was independently associated with death (hazard ratio
      [HR], 3.83; 95% CI, 1.62-9.08) and CVE (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.53-9.33), whereas VC 
      or IDH alone was not. Patients with both VC and IDH had the highest risk for a
      composite event (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.79-7.08). Significant synergistic
      interaction was observed between VC and IDH (P for interaction=0.009).
      CONCLUSIONS: VC was independently associated with IDH. Coexistence of VC and IDH 
      was associated with higher risk of death and CVEs than either factor alone. There
      was a synergistic interaction between VC and IDH for the risk of a composite
      event.

TI  - Do breast arterial calcifications on mammography predict elevated risk of
      coronary artery disease?

LID - S0720-048X(16)30081-X [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen on
      mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary CT as it
      may serve as a potential marker for increased risk of developing symptomatic
      coronary artery disease (CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the
      imaging database at our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent 
      coronary CT within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary
      calcium score on CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification by
      weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for all lesions
      and expressed as Agaston score. Calculated scores were risk stratified for
      developing CAD as follows: 0-no risk; 1-10-minimal; 11-100-mild;
      101-400-moderate; >400-high risk. Percentile distribution of calcium score
      adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based on results of the
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which excluded patient with
      diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms were reviewed by
      MQSA-certified breast radiologists who were blinded to patients' coronary calcium
      scores. Mammograms were interpreted for presence or absence of BAC. The calcium
      scores and corresponding percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography.
      Cardiac risk factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family
      history of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: BAC
      correlated with coronary calcium score of >11 (p=0.0001), corresponding to mild
      or greater risk of developing CAD. Specifically, coronary calcium score of >11
      was seen in 68% (25/37) of patients with BAC and 31% (34/108) of patients without
      BAC. Accounting for race, gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically
      significant correlation with percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4% (19/27) of
      patients with BAC vs. 44.6% (41/92) of patient without BAC showed percentile
      score of >25 for developing CAD. Statistically significant association was
      observed of BAC with diabetes (p=0.01) and chronic renal disease (p=0.005). BAC
      showed no significant associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and
      family history of CAD. CONCLUSION: BAC does predict coronary artery calcium score
      of >11, which indicates mild or greater risk of developing CAD. In addition,
      statistically significant correlation exists between BAC and cardiac risk
      factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our study suggests that BAC
      on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker for increased risk of
      developing CAD.

TI  - Aberrant activation of Wnt pathways in arteries associates with vascular
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of vascular calcification
      in CKD patients remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical
      association between abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification
      in ESRD patients. METHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this
      study. Tissue samples of radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous
      fistula surgery. Expression of Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry 
      with antibodies against catenin, GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was
      performed to evaluate the association between Wnt activities and vascular
      calcification rates. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that
      increased expressions of beta-catenin, GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed 
      in the subjects with vascular calcification. Further correlation analysis
      identified that beta-catenin expression in overall arterial samples was
      significantly associated with the expressions of GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also
      found significant correlation between expressions of GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the 
      studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that 
      Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular calcification in patients with
      ESRD. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased activation of Wnt pathways in
      the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is significantly correlated with the
      incidence of vascular calcification. These findings support Wnt pathways as a
      potential target for future therapy of vascular calcification in CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relationship between mineral metabolism disorders,
      bone fractures and vascular calcifications in kidney transplant recipients has
      not been established. METHOD: We performed a cross-sectional study in 727 stable 
      recipients from 28 Spanish transplant clinics. Mineral metabolism parameters, the
      semi-quantification of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcifications
      were determined centrally. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3<15ng/ml) was
      more common in female recipients at CKD-T stages I-III (29.6% vs 44.4%; p=0.003).
      The inverse and significant correlation between 25OHD3 and PTH was
      gender-specific and women exhibited a steeper slope than men (p=0.01). Vertebral 
      fractures (VFx) with deformity grade >/=2 were observed in 15% of recipients.
      Factors related to VFx differed by gender; in males, age (OR 1.04; 95% CI
      1.01-1.06) and CsA treatment (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6-6.3); in females, age (OR
      1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12) and PTH levels (OR per 100pg/ml increase: 1.27; 95% CI: 
      1.043-1.542). Abdominal aortic calcifications were common (67.2%) and related to 
      classical risk factors but not to mineral metabolism parameters. CONCLUSIONS:
      Vitamin D deficiency is more common among female kidney transplant recipients at 
      earlier CKD-T stages, and it contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
      Prevalent vertebral fractures are only related to high serum PTH levels in female
      recipients.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the distribution of coronary artery
      calcium score (CACS) by age group and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and to
      evaluate the association between CV risk factors and CACS classification in
      asymptomatic adults. The study included 31,545 asymptomatic Koreans, over 20
      years of age with no previous history of malignancy, proven coronary artery
      disease, or stroke, who underwent CACS computed tomography at the Health
      Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, between January 2005 and June 2013.
      Mean (+/-SD) age was 53.8 (+/-8.5) years overall, 56.1 (+/-8.3) in men, and 53.3 
      (+/-8.5) in women. They were classified into five groups based on their resting
      CACS: none (CAC = 0), minimal (0 < CAC </= 10), mild (10 < CAC </= 100), moderate
      (100 < CAC </= 400), and extensive (400 > CAC). Older age groups exhibited higher
      CACS values. The proportion of CACS classification in our study was 55.5 % with
      no CACS, 9.5 % with minimal CACS, 19.8 % with mild CACS, 10.8 % with moderate
      CACS, and 4.3 % with extensive CACS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated
      for CV risk factors to determine their association with CACS. When analyzed
      according to sex, in males, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with the presence 
      of hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, chronic kidney disease,
      and smoking status. While, in females, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with
      the presence of HT, DM, and obesity. CV risk factors appear to be significantly
      associated with CACS in the Korean population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are
      representative markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined
      effects on clinical outcomes remain undetermined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
      included 523 patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been
      examined with fundus photography for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple
      radiographs were analyzed for the presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC
      of the abdominal aorta and iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was
      evaluated in terms of the rate of renal function decline and composite of any
      cardiovascular event or death. CKD patients with retinopathy showed higher
      prevalence of apVC than those without retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P <
      0.001).The presence of retinopathy was independently associated with apVC (OR
      2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate analysis, compared with subjects with
      neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence of both apVC and retinopathy were
      independently associated with rapid renal function decline (beta = -1.51; 95% CI 
      -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were not. Compared with subjects
      with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite end points were 1.05
      (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 1.17, 3.67) for
      patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with both apVC
      and retinopathy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of VC and retinopathy 
      was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular events or
      deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.

TI  - Serum Sclerostin as an Independent Marker of Peripheral Arterial Stiffness in
      Renal Transplantation Recipients: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e3300
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003300 [doi]
AB  - Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is thought to be implicated in the development
      of arterial stiffness and vascular calcification. As a Wnt signaling pathway
      inhibitor, it is interesting to investigate whether sclerostin or dickkopf-1
      (DKK1) level is correlated with arterial stiffness in renal transplant (RT)
      recipients. Fasting blood samples were obtained for biochemical data, sclerostin,
      DKK1, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) determinations. In this study, we applied
      automatic pulse wave analyzer (VaSera VS-1000) to measure brachial-ankle pulse
      wave velocity and either sides of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity value, which
      greater than 14.0 m/s was determined as high arterial stiffness. Among 68 RT
      recipients, 30 patients (44.1%) were in the high arterial stiffness group.
      Compared with patients in the low arterial stiffness group, patients in the high 
      arterial stiffness group had higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.002),
      diabetes (P < 0.001), metabolic syndrome (P = 0.025), longer posttransplant
      duration (P = 0.005), higher systolic blood pressure (P < 0.001) and diastolic
      blood pressure (P = 0.018), and higher fasting glucose (P = 0.004), total
      cholesterol (P = 0.042), blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.020), phosphorus (P = 0.042),
      and sclerostin levels (P = 0.001). According to our multivariable forward
      stepwise linear regression analysis, age (beta = 0.272, P = 0.014), phosphorus
      (beta = 0.308, P = 0.007), and logarithmically-transformed OPG (log-OPG; beta =
      0.222, P = 0.046) were positively associated with sclerostin levels, and
      multivariate logistic regression analysis, sclerostin (odds ratio 1.052, 95%
      confidence interval 1.007-1.099, P = 0.024), and posttransplant duration (odds
      ratio 1.024, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.045, P = 0.019) were the independent
      predictors of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients. In this study,
      serum sclerostin level, but not DKK1, was proved to be involved in the
      pathogenetic process of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients.

TI  - POEMS syndrome and calciphylaxis: an unrecognized cause of abnormal small vessel 
      calcification.
PG  - 35
LID - 10.1186/s13023-016-0421-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification,
      thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic
      hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on
      calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly,
      endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease
      associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF). METHODS: In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and
      gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification
      by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles
      were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological
      examination was performed in six autopsy cases. RESULTS: Small vessel
      calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of the
      controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. Among
      POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and
      ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels,
      was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine,
      calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome.
      Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6
      may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different
      mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a
      potential cause of calciphylaxis.

TI  - High-Flux Hemodialysis and High-Volume Hemodiafiltration Improve Serum
      Calcification Propensity.
PG  - e0151508
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0151508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciprotein particles (CPPs) may play an important role in the
      calcification process. The calcification propensity of serum (T50) is highly
      predictive of all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease patients. Whether T50
      is therapeutically improvable, by high-flux hemodialysis (HD) or
      hemodiafiltration (HDF), has not been studied yet. METHODS: We designed a
      cross-sectional single center study, and included stable prevalent in-center
      dialysis patients on HD or HDF. Patients were divided into two groups based on
      dialysis modality, were on a thrice-weekly schedule, had a dialysis vintage of > 
      3 months and vascular access providing a blood flow rate > 300 ml/min.
      Calcification propensity of serum was measured by the time of transformation from
      primary to secondary CPP (T50 test), by time-resolved nephelometry. RESULTS: We
      included 64 patients, mean convective volume was 21.7L (SD 3.3L). In the pooled
      analysis, T50 levels increased in both the HD and HDF group with pre- and
      post-dialysis (mean (SD)) of 244(64) - 301(57) and 253(55) - 304(61) min
      respectively (P = 0.43(HD vs. HDF)). The mean increase in T50 was 26.29% for HD
      and 21.97% for HDF patients (P = 0.61 (HD vs. HDF)). The delta values (Delta) of 
      calcium, phosphate and serum albumin were equal in both groups. Baseline T50 was 
      negatively correlated with phosphate, and positively correlated with serum
      magnesium and fetuin-A. The DeltaT50 was mostly influenced by Delta phosphate (r 
      = -0.342; P = 0.002 HD and r = -0.396; P<0.001 HDF) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      HD and HDF patients present with same baseline T50 calcification propensity
      values pre-dialysis. Calcification propensity is significantly improved during
      both HD and HDF sessions without significant differences between both modalities.

TI  - Mineral and bone disorders, morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal failure
      patients on chronic dialysis.
PG  - 94-103
LID - 10.15386/cjmed-515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In spite of numerous interventions, the control of mineral
      disturbances remains poor in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Chronic
      kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) represent an important
      cause of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to analyze the
      relationship between mineral and bone disorders (MBD) and their components impact
      on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CDV) mortality and morbidity in
      chronic dialysis patients. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in a
      cohort of 92 randomly selected patients with ESRF treated with hemodialysis (HD) 
      and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The data regarding demographic and clinical
      characteristics were recorded, including vascular disease (coronary, cerebral,
      peripheral). The follow-up lasted 40 months and the final evaluation included the
      number and causes of deaths, CDV events and disease. Serum Ca, P, ALP, iPTH,
      albumin, cholesterol, urea and creatinine levels were measured. The plain
      radiographic films of hands and pelvis evaluated all bone abnormalities
      suggestive of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) and peripheral vascular calcification
      (VC). RESULTS: All-cause annual mortality represented 9.25% in HD and 9.09% in PD
      patients. The CDV mortality represented almost 44% in HD patients and 66% in PD
      patients from all deaths. There was a high prevalence of CDV diseases and events.
      High and low serum P levels were associated with a worse survival rate.
      Hypercalcaemia was associated with high risk for CDV events in HD patients. In PD
      patients, the relationship between increased ALP levels and all-cause mortality
      was significant. Other mineral markers were not predictive of the outcome in the 
      studied patients. In the HD patients the severity of VC was associated with
      all-cause and CDV mortality, and with CDV events. Male gender,
      hypercholesterolemia, decreased URR, albumin and creatinine were identified as
      risk factors for all-cause mortality. The diabetics had higher death rates. Low
      dialysis efficacy represented a risk factor for mortality and CDV diseases and
      events. In PD patients, low albumin induced a higher death rate. In PD patients
      the death rate was similar to HD patients. CONCLUSION: All-cause mortality was
      higher than in general population, but lower than the chronic dialysis patients' 
      mortality reported in other studies. The death rates in HD and PD patients were
      similar. VC and serum P levels influenced the outcome in the HD patients -
      increased the risk for all-cause and CDV mortality, but also for CDV events. ALP 
      levels influenced outcome in PD patients. There were no significant differences
      between HD and PD patients regarding outcome.

TI  - Serum magnesium level and vascular stiffness in children with chronic kidney
      disease on regular hemodialysis.
PG  - 233-40
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.178205 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular
      calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this 
      population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple
      cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this
      study, we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular
      stiffness in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included
      25 children with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25
      healthy children age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were
      measured, and Doppler ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT)
      and the peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the
      (aorta, carotid, and femoral) arteries were recorded in the study patients. There
      were significantly lower serum Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the
      controls (1.7 +/- 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 +/- 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001).
      There was a significant increase in the aorta and carotid IMT in the study group 
      than in the controls (0.45 +/- 0.07 mm vs. 0.40 +/- 0.09 mm; 0.98 +/- 0.57 mm vs.
      0.55 +/- 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, respectively), whereas there were no
      significant differences regarding the PSV of the carotid, aorta, and femoral
      arteries between the study patients and the controls (P >0.05). A negative
      correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT (AIMT) (r = -0.682; 
      P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the
      AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 0.025, 0.472, P =
      0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were associated with
      vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our results
      warrants further study.

TI  - The Association of Coronary Artery Calcium With Noncardiovascular Disease: The
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 568-576
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if coronary artery calcium (CAC) is
      associated with incident noncardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: CAC is considered
      a measure of vascular aging, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and
      all-cause mortality. The relationship with noncardiovascular disease is not well 
      defined. METHODS: A total of 6,814 participants from 6 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study
      of Atherosclerosis) field centers were followed for a median of 10.2 years.
      Modified Cox proportional hazards ratios accounting for the competing risk of
      fatal coronary heart disease were calculated for new diagnoses of cancer,
      pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease
      (CKD), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, and dementia.
      Analyses were adjusted for age; sex; race; socioeconomic status; health insurance
      status; body mass index; physical activity; diet; tobacco use; number of
      medications used; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; total and high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol; antihypertensive, aspirin, and cholesterol medication;
      and diabetes. The outcome was first incident noncardiovascular disease diagnosis.
      RESULTS: Compared with those with CAC = 0, those with CAC >400 had an increased
      hazard of cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 
      1.99), CKD (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.39), pneumonia (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.37 to
      2.82), COPD (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.60 to 4.57), and hip fracture (HR: 4.29; 95% CI:
      1.47 to 12.50). CAC >400 was not associated with dementia or deep vein
      thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Those with CAC = 0 had decreased risk of cancer
      (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), CKD (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), COPD (HR:
      0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), and hip fracture (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.70)
      compared to those with CAC >0. CAC = 0 was not associated with less pneumonia,
      dementia, or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. The results were
      attenuated, but remained significant, after removing participants developing
      interim nonfatal coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with elevated 
      CAC were at increased risk of cancer, CKD, COPD, and hip fractures. Those with
      CAC = 0 are less likely to develop common age-related comorbid conditions, and
      represent a unique population of "healthy agers."

TI  - Serum magnesium is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in the
      Genetics of Atherosclerotic Disease (GEA) study.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s12937-016-0143-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum magnesium is inversely associated to coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney disease. There is little
      information on this association in a general healthy population. OBJECTIVE: The
      aim of this study was to examine the cross-sectional association of serum
      magnesium levels with CAC. METHODS: We included 1276 Mexican-mestizo subjects (50
      % women), aged 30-75 years, free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease. CAC was
      quantified by multidetector computed tomography using the method described by
      Agatston. Cross-sectional associations of serum magnesium with cardiometabolic
      factors and subclinical atherosclerosis defined as a CAC score > 0, were examined
      in logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking status,
      body mass index, systolic blood pressure, physical activity, elevated abdominal
      visceral tissue, fasting insulin and glucose, alcohol consumption, menopausal
      status (women only), low (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (HDL-C), triglycerides, diuretic use, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and family 
      history of DM2. RESULTS: After full adjustment, subjects in the highest quartile 
      of serum magnesium had 48 % lower odds of hypertension (p = 0.028), 69 % lower
      odds of DM2 (p = 0.003), and 42 % lower odds of CAC score > 0 (p = 0.016)
      compared to those with the lowest serum magnesium. The analyses also showed that 
      a 0.17 mg/dL (1SD) increment in serum magnesium was independently associated with
      16 % lower CAC (OR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.724-0.986). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of
      Mexican-mestizo subjects, low serum magnesium was independently associated to
      higher prevalence not only of hypertension and DM2, but also to coronary artery
      calcification, which is a marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - High Serum Sclerostin Levels Are Associated with a Better Outcome in
      Haemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1159/000443845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis.
      Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification
      (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin
      levels are high. AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with
      VC, bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum
      sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and 
      survival rate. RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin
      level of 1.9 +/- 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum
      sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml)
      were significantly older (73.7 +/- 12 vs. 64.7 +/- 18 years), more frequently of 
      the male gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases
      values (14 +/- 9 vs. 20.4 +/- 13 microg/l), were less frequently treated with
      alfacalcidol, displayed lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 +/- 5 vs. 12.5 +/-
      7/24) and had higher BMD scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile
      displayed a lower mortality rate compared to tertile 1 using multivariable
      adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main
      factors associated with VC score were age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP 
      level and Warfarin use. CONCLUSION: Our study of HD patients shows that higher
      serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher BMD, lower aortic
      calcification scores, and a better survival rate.

TI  - FGF-23 levels are associated with vascular calcification, but not with
      atherosclerosis, in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The 
      aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between
      plasma FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery
      intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this
      cross-sectional study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients 
      who underwent coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by
      multi-slice computerized tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution 
      color Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR
      30.8-249.5). Median CACs was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with
      severe calcification (CACs > 400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification.
      Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 +/- 0.20 mm, and the presence of carotid plaques was 51%
      with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level was positively correlated with serum
      calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r =
      0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence of carotid artery plaques
      correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal regression analysis, FGF-23
      level was an independent predictor for severe CACs together with age, gender,
      presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001).
      As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in patients with FGF-23
      level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In HD 
      patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the prediction of
      coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with carotid
      artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
      with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-41
LID - 10.5414/CN108716 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on
      peritoneal dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated
      with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD.
      However, the role of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study,
      we aimed to assess the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial
      dysfunction, vascular calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD
      patients. METHODS: Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D
      echocardiography. Intact FGF23 blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit
      (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a
      surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a 
      surrogate marker of arterial stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral
      arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using
      the Adragao score. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively
      correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p =
      0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p =
      0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was negatively correlated with age (r
      = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r 
      = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted analysis, FGF23 was associated
      with LVMI (beta = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (beta = 0.345, p = 0.018), and age 
      (beta = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, gender, residual
      renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic blood pressure.
      There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in
      multivariable- adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is
      associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or 
      vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Increased Peripheral Arterial Calcification in Patients Receiving Warfarin.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002665 [doi]
LID - e002665 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular
      calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial
      calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men 
      is unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral arteries
      was compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      This retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 patients with radiographs
      performed during or after warfarin therapy who were identified by a computerized 
      search of medical records. Each patient was matched to a patient without warfarin
      exposure based on age, sex, and diabetes status. Patients with warfarin exposure 
      <1 month, history of end-stage renal disease, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were
      excluded. Radiographs were reviewed visually for arterial calcification. The
      prevalence of arterial calcification was 44% greater in patients with versus
      without warfarin use (30.2% versus 20.9%, P=0.0023) but not on radiographs
      performed before warfarin therapy (26.4% versus 22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years
      of warfarin therapy. The increase was noted only in the ankle and foot, was
      limited to a medial pattern of calcification, and was similar in men and women.
      CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is associated with lower extremity arterial
      calcification in both men and women independent of age, sex, diabetes status, and
      other patient characteristics. This may have implications for the choice of
      therapies for long-term anticoagulation.

TI  - Application of a Novel CT-Based Iliac Artery Calcification Scoring System for
      Predicting Renal Transplant Outcomes.
PG  - 436-41
LID - 10.2214/AJR.15.14794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and
      distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium
      scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT
      of the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56
      women with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate
      semiquantitative score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and
      morphology for the common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The
      operative and clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial
      segment was used for anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether
      delayed graft function (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient
      survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS: Excellent
      interobserver agreement was noted for each calcification score category. The
      common iliac arteries showed significantly higher average calcification scores
      than the external iliac arteries for all categories. Advanced age and diabetes
      mellitus were independently predictive of higher scores in each category, whereas
      hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on
      multivariate analysis, only the calcification morphology score of the arterial
      segment used for anastomosis was independently predictive of a higher rate of
      surgical complexity and of DGF. None of the scores was predictive of graft or
      patient survival. However, patients with CT evidence of iliac arterial
      calcification had a lower 1-year survival after transplant than those who did not
      (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Only the calcification
      morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was significantly
      predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine pretransplant CT for
      calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with diabetes mellitus
      may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to optimize outcomes.

TI  - Is low magnesium a clue to arteriovenous fistula complications in hemodialysis?
PG  - 773-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1207-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnesium insufficiency is a pro-atherogenic factor involved in
      endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and vascular calcification. Our aim was
      to examine the role of magnesium in the development of arteriovenous fistula
      complications in hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical
      investigation of data from 88 patients who were divided into two groups: those
      with and without arteriovenous fistula complications. We examined the influence
      of sex, demographics, and clinical and laboratory parameters. The existence of
      fistula stenosis was determined by measuring Doppler flow, while B-mode
      ultrasound was used to detect plaques and evaluate the carotid artery
      intima-media thickness. RESULTS: Patients with arteriovenous fistula
      complications had significantly higher leukocyte counts (p = 0.03), platelet
      counts (p = 0.03), phosphate concentrations (p = 0.044), and alkaline phosphatase
      concentrations (p = 0.04). Patients without complications had significantly
      greater blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula (p < 0.0005), higher
      magnesium concentrations (p = 0.004), and a lower carotid artery intima-media
      thickness (p = 0.037). The magnesium level was inversely correlated with
      leukocyte (p = 0.028) and platelet (p = 0.016) counts. The magnesium
      concentration was significantly lower in patients with carotid artery plaques (p 
      = 0.03). Multiple linear regression, using magnesium as the dependent variable in
      patients with arteriovenous fistula complications, indicated statistically
      significant correlations with platelet (p = 0.005) and leukocyte (p = 0.027)
      counts and carotid plaques (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Hypomagnesemia is a
      significant pro-atherogenic factor and an important predictor of arteriovenous
      fistula complications.

TI  - The Relationship Between Obesity and Calciphylaxis: A Review of the Literature.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel
      arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). A review of the literature was conducted to explore
      existing evidence about the relationship between obesity and calciphylaxis. A
      total of 54 publications (published between 1962 and 2015) were identified. Most 
      studies noted a variety of risk factors for calciphylaxis, including CKD, female 
      gender, Caucasian race, liver disease, and lower serum albumin. Obesity was
      identified as a risk factor in 6 of the 8 studies reviewed. In one study, obesity
      was found to increase the risk of calciphylaxis 4-fold. The majority of
      calciphylaxis lesions in obese persons were proximal in distribution; all studies
      report proximal lesions are associated with a higher mortality rate than distal
      lesions. The mortality rate of persons with CKD and calciphylaxis is 8 times
      higher than that of persons with CKD without calciphylaxis. There is no
      definitive evidence to support the belief current epidemic rates of obesity,
      diabetes, (diabesity), and chronic renal disease will predispose more patients to
      the development of calciphylaxis. However, until more information from the
      calciphylaxis registries and other studies is available, clinicians should
      maintain a high index of suspicion when a patient presents with indurated,
      painful nodules or necrotic ulcers, especially if the patient also has CKD.

TI  - Correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 15745-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with
      hemodialysis. METHODS: As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study.
      According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 etag/ml or less than 30 etag/ml) and
      25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (>30 etag/ml). All of the subjects
      underwent lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree 
      of calcification (Kauppila score). RESULTS: Among the 126 patients treated with
      MHD, there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients 
      with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no significant difference found 
      in gender, age, age of dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood
      phosphorus, blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between 
      the two groups. The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with
      25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients
      with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      level had a negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P =
      0.193). Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor
      for vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is
      generally low in patients with MHD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D deficiency have a higher incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly
      negative correlation. Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D
      deficiency should be actively treated.

TI  - Safety of warfarin therapy in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective cohort
      study.
PG  - 787-794
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study to assess the
      safety of warfarin therapy in Japanese hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS:
      Chronic HD patients on warfarin therapy (warfarin users) were recruited from 111 
      HD centers in Japan. Two dialysis-vintage-matched warfarin non-users (non-users) 
      were selected from the same HD center as each warfarin user. Clinical data were
      collected upon registration and every 12 months thereafter for up to 36 months.
      RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 365 warfarin users and 692 non-users and
      was followed for an average of 27.7 months. The mean age of warfarin users (68.8 
      +/- 10.6 years) was significantly higher than that of non-users (66.9 +/- 11.0
      years, p < 0.001). The analyses by multivariate Cox proportional-hazard models
      showed that the age [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.07 for each 1-year increase, 95 %
      confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.08, p < 0.001] was significantly associated with 
      the death from any cause, but warfarin use (1.08, CI 0.75-1.57, p = 0.68) was not
      when being adjusted for sex, diabetes mellitus, antiplatelet use, and atrial
      fibrillation. The risk of composite events, which included death from any cause, 
      stroke, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, was also
      associated with age but was not associated with warfarin use. CONCLUSION: The
      results of this study suggested that warfarin use by HD patients might not be
      harmful in chronic state, while the safety for the initiation of warfarin therapy
      in HD patients remained to be determined.

TI  - Pre-treatment considerations in childhood hypertension due to chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 500-10
LID - 10.5527/wjn.v4.i5.500 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension (HTN) develops very early in childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      It is linked with rapid progression of kidney disease, increased morbidity and
      mortality hence the imperative to start anti-hypertensive medication when blood
      pressure (BP) is persistently > 90(th) percentile for age, gender, and height in 
      non-dialyzing hypertensive children with CKD. HTN pathomechanism in CKD is
      multifactorial and complexly interwoven. The patient with CKD-associated HTN
      needs to be carefully evaluated for co-morbidities that frequently alter the
      course of the disease as successful treatment of HTN in CKD goes beyond life
      style modification and anti-hypertensive therapy alone. Chronic anaemia, volume
      overload, endothelial dysfunction, arterial media calcification, and metabolic
      derangements like secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphataemia, and
      calcitriol deficiency are a few co-morbidities that may cause or worsen HTN in
      CKD. It is important to know if the HTN is caused or made worse by the toxic
      effects of medications like erythropoietin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus,
      corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Poor treatment
      response may be due to any of these co-morbidities and medications. A
      satisfactory hypertensive CKD outcome, therefore, depends very much on
      identifying and managing these co-morbid conditions and HTN promoting medications
      promptly and appropriately. This review attempts to point attention to factors
      that may affect successful treatment of the hypertensive CKD child and how to
      attain the desired therapeutic BP target.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of
      studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant
      recipients, and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of
      patient and graft prognosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational,
      retrospective study of 119 renal transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic
      calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We established 2 categories: absence (KI =
      0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before transplantation. We analyzed the
      impact of calcification in graft and patient survival, new-onset diabetes
      mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal function, and mineral
      metabolism. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) before renal
      transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical differences
      were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass index,
      and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to first 2 
      years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft survival
      in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In line
      with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and
      cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P 
      = .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent
      predictor for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular
      events. CONCLUSIONS: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time 
      of transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after
      renal transplantation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal
      transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated 
      Wnt signaling contributes to VC. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate
      whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with
      progression of VC. DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal
      observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study. SETTING: The setting was a 
      tertiary care academic hospital. PATIENTS: Coronary artery calcification and
      aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in
      268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 +/- 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189
      patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels 
      were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to
      identify determinants of baseline VC and progression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The
      main outcome measure was progression of VC. RESULTS: VC was present in up to 84% 
      of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of
      VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline
      demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in
      univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and
      PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent 
      determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final
      regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse
      association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden
      and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. 
      Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease 
      patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the
      vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory
      mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are 
      required for confirmation.

TI  - Assessment of the relationship between selected cardiovascular risk factors and
      the indices of intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium score in
      various stages of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2003-12
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1132-8 [doi]
AB  - Renal diseases pose a growing epidemiological and health problem worldwide.
      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths among patients with
      chronic kidney disease. Increased risk of atherosclerosis in these patients
      results from the occurrence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the relationship between selected risk factors
      for cardiovascular diseases (age, sex, dyslipidemia, hypertension, etc.),
      intima-media thickness and coronary artery calcium score in patients with chronic
      kidney disease stages 2, 3 and 4. This study included 60 patients with chronic
      kidney disease divided into 3 groups on the basis of disease stage and control
      group consisting of 20 individuals without diagnosed chronic kidney disease and
      cardiovascular diseases. Blood analysis and blood pressure measurements were
      taken. All patients underwent carotid artery ultrasound with the assessment of
      the intima-media thickness, and heart CT scan in order to assess the index of
      coronary artery calcification. Logistic regression analysis revealed
      statistically significant correlation between blood vessels calcification and
      age--the increase in age by 1 year was associated with the increase in the risk
      of coronary artery calcification by 6.7 %. The increase in IMT by about 0.1 mm
      raises the risk of calcification by about 2 %. Second logistic regression model
      revealed that one-year increase in age was associated with an increase in the
      risk of intima-media thickening by 6.5 %. Occurrence of hypertension was
      associated with a ninefold increase in intima-media thickening risk in comparison
      with patients with normal blood pressure. To sum up, age and hypertension were
      associated with the growth of IMT in CKD patients, while age and exposure to
      tobacco smoke were associated with the increase in coronary artery calcium score.
      The relationship between thickening of IMT and the increase in calcification
      index in patients was also observed in study group.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and low vitamin D levels are associated with severe vascular 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 419-426
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0236-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major
      complications of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high
      prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, 
      which should be prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased
      risk of VCs and fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis
      patients with and without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as
      identifying the associated risk factors. METHODS: A total of 314 hemodialysis
      patients were recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF.
      Comorbidities, chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and
      therapies were collected. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out
      centrally for the detection of fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by 
      >/=20 %. In the same radiograph, the length of aortic calcification was also
      measured. Logistic regression models were applied for evaluating the independent 
      predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral fractures. RESULTS: In our population
      VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs (>10 cm) were more common in patients
      with AF (76 %) than in patients without (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present 
      in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI
      2.30-12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.10-3.83) were
      independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) and male
      gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07-2.90) predicted vertebral fractures. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe VCs, especially when
      affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated with severe VCs.
      Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and associated with
      older age and male gender.

TI  - Increased arterial inflammation in individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 333-339

AB  - PURPOSE: While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      are at increased risk for the development and progression of atherosclerosis, it 
      is not known whether arterial inflammation is increased in mild CKD. The aim of
      this study was to compare arterial inflammation using (18)F-FDG PET/CT in
      patients with CKD and in matched controls. METHODS: This restrospective study
      included 128 patients undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for clinical indications,
      comprising 64 patients with stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age,
      gender, and cancer history. CKD was defined according to guidelines using a
      calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured 
      in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. Background FDG uptake (venous,
      subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. Coronary artery calcification (CAC)
      was assessed using the CT images. The impact of CKD on arterial inflammation and 
      CAC was then assessed. RESULTS: Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with
      CKD than in matched controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 +/- 0.49 vs.
      2.16 +/- 0.43; p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR (r =
      -0.299, p = 0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in patients with
      CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not differ between groups.
      Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in patients with CKD
      compared to controls after correcting for muscle and fat background, and also
      remained significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was 
      associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of
      subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC). CONCLUSION: Moderate CKD is associated with
      increased arterial inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, the increased
      arterial inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. 
      Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of
      atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular
      events.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification independently predicts
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to
      evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification
      (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal
      transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a
      large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry. METHODS:
      Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic
      Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% 
      white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC
      scores were derived. RESULTS: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable 
      baseline TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 +/- 0.8 years, during which 12%
      developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age 
      across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks 
      than whites. After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed 
      age, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with
      incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a
      positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although
      the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an 
      annual score change of >/=100 and blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic
      groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering
      medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression.
      CONCLUSIONS: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC
      incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change
      across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary
      calcification.

TI  - Doppler ultrasound and calcification score: improving vascular access
      surveillance.
PG  - 1425-9

AB  - AIM: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which
      increases morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is
      thrombosis, due to flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. 
      This occurs not only due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones related
      to vascular atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has developed 
      a simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification 
      and arterial stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic procedures
      for VA surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive power for the
      detection of stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of systemic factors,
      especially SCVS, on Qa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversal study in 50 patients.
      Qa value was obtained with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson 
      coefficient evaluated correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological
      variables were recorded and non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied
      with them. RESULTS: Pearson's corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851
      (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p =
      0.021), SCVS (p = 0.030), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on 
      dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa varied significantly with diabetes status (p =
      0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial
      pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender,
      hypertensive status and analitical parameters did not change the flow values.
      CONCLUSION: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower DU-Qas, giving this method
      an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a simple method like SVCS
      may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations accordingly to risk
      stratification.

TI  - Increased circulating sclerostin levels in end-stage renal disease predict
      biopsy-verified vascular medial calcification and coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 1356-1364
LID - 10.1038/ki.2015.194 [doi]
AB  - Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to
      mineral bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of
      vascular calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with
      measures of calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with
      end-stage renal disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in the
      serum of patients with epigastric and coronary artery calcification
      (calcification score 100 or more). In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin
      levels significantly associated with age, intact parathyroid hormone,
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent calcification. Multivariable
      regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin each significantly
      associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. Receiver operating
      characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) predicted
      vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein expressions were low
      or absent, and did not differ between calcified and non-calcified vessels,
      suggesting that the vasculature is not a major contributor to circulating levels.
      Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate with the extent of vascular
      calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery CT and scoring of epigastric
      artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers of mineral bone disorder, only
      sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

TI  - [Role of the morphogenetic proteins FGF-23 and Klotho and the glycoprotein
      sclerostin in the assessment of the risk of cardiovascular diseases and the
      prognosis of chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 10-16

AB  - UNLABELLED: AIM. To analyze changes in the serum concentrations of the
      morphogenetic proteins fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and Klotho, as well
      as sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted glycoprotein, in relation to the degree of
      hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and arterial stiffness in
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at its different stages. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: Sixty-five patients (33 men and 32 women) aged 20-65 years, including 25
      with chronic glomerulonephritis, 15 with tubulointerstitial nephritis, and 25
      with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, were examined. A control group consisted of 15
      healthy volunteers matched to the study group patients for age and gender. Serum 
      FGF-23 concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were measured in the all subjects. 
      Patients with BPs > 140/80 mm Hg underwent echocardiography, followed by
      determination of LV mass (LVM) and calculation of LVM index. Vascular
      circulation, pulse wave velocity, cardiac and vascular calcifications, and
      vascular functional properties were estimated. RESULTS: There was a strong direct
      Correlation between the serum concentration of FGF-23 and the stage of CKD and an
      inverse correlation between the levels of Klotho and sclerostin and the stage of 
      CKD. As the glomerular filtration rate became lower, the concentration of FGF-23 
      increased and that of Klotho and sclerostin decreased just in Stage III CKD while
      hyperphosphatemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels were noted in Stages
      IV-V CKD. As CKD progressed, the serum concentrations of Klotho and sclerostin
      were inversely correlated with the levels of phosphorus and parathyroid hormone. 
      The degree of blood pressure elevation correlated positively with serum FGF-23
      concentrations and inversely with Klotho levels. There was no significant
      correlation of the level of sclerostin with the degree of BP increase. The direct
      correlation between higher FGF-23 level and higher VLM is most pronounced in
      hypertensive patients. There was a strong direct relationship between FGF-23 and 
      Klotho levels and a strong inverse relationship between sclerostin levels and
      pulse wave velocity. Lower Klotho concentrations were associated with the
      detection rate of calcifications in the heart valves and large arteries (the
      abdominal aorta). The reduced serum levels of Klotho and sclerostin were also
      correlated with concentric LV remodeling. CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that
      there was a clear link between increased serum FGF-23 and decreased Klotho
      concentration as CKD progressed, and that between arterial stiffness and
      calcification and myocardial remodelling regardless of traditional risk factors. 
      More experimental and clinical studies are required to clarify the role of
      sclerostin in CKD.

TI  - Serum S100A12 and Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification Over 4 Years in
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 4-13
LID - 10.1159/000438869 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is common and contributes to increased
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this prospective
      study, we aimed to investigate the associations of serum S100A12 in the presence 
      of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) and the progression of CAC in HD
      patients. METHODS: Sixty maintenance HD patients and 30 controls were enrolled.
      Serum S100A12 levels were measured using ELISA. CAC scores (CACs) were measured
      twice at a 4-year interval using multislice spiral CT. The HD patients were
      classified as rapid progressors or slow progressors according to the change in
      the CACs across these 2 measurements (x0394;CACs). RESULTS: The incidences of
      rapid progression of CAC in patients with baseline CACs </=10, CACs >10 and CACs 
      >400 were 12.5, 40.0 and 64.3%, respectively. Both baseline and 4-year serum
      S100A12 levels were significantly higher in the rapid progressors than in the
      slow progressors (medians of 45.6 vs. 30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001 and 62.3 vs. 39.4
      ng/ml, p = 0.002, respectively). The serum S100A12 levels were significantly
      correlated with baseline CACs (r = 0.466, p < 0.001), 4-year CACs (r = 0.440, p <
      0.001) and x0394;CACs (r = 0.392, p < 0.001). Importantly, the x0394;CACs were
      significantly correlated with x0394;S100A12 levels (r = 0.396, p < 0.001).
      Logistic regression analysis revealed that the serum S100A12 level was as an
      independent determinant of the presence of severe CAC and that the increment in
      the serum S100A12 level was a factor that was significantly independently
      associated with the progression of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S100A12 levels were
      significantly associated with the presence of severe CAC, and the increment in
      serum S100A12 levels was an independent determinant of the progression of CAC.

TI  - The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium
      concentration among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0139-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is
      inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been
      several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors
      (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) 
      Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is
      currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to
      affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in
      whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels. METHODS:
      Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was
      determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week
      intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The
      relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted
      analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD,
      diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration. RESULTS: 55 % of patients
      were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a
      dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 
      0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users
      (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for
      dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In
      addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) 
      and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend
      toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p =
      0.067). CONCLUSION: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as
      compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the
      magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse
      outcomes.

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 on progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification
      in nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5.
PG  - 631-40
LID - AOP_15_066 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of
      vitamin K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and
      vascular calcification. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of vitamin K2
      substitution on the progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in
      nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3-5. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study
      included 42 nondialyzed patients with CKD. The following measurements were taken 
      at baseline and after 270 +/-12 days of supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose
      of 90 mug (menaquinone, MK-7) together with 10 mug of cholecalciferol (K+D group)
      or 10 mug of cholecalciferol (group D): common carotid intima-media thickness
      (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcification score (CACS), basic biochemical
      parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix Gla protein (MGP),
      desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), fetuin A,
      osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23. RESULTS: The increase of
      CCA-IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D group: from 
      0.95 +/-0.2 mm to 1.01 +/-0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 +/-0.2 mm to 1.16 +/-0.3, P
      = 0.003 (DeltaCCA-IMT, 0.06 +/-0.08 vs 0.136 +/-0.05 mm, P = 0.005,
      respectively). The increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in
      the D group (DeltaCACS, 58.1 +/-106.5 AU vs 74.4 +/-127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the
      K+D group, a significant decrease in the level of dp-ucMGP and total OC was
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 270-day course of vitamin K2 administration in patients 
      with CKD stages 3-5 may reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, but does not
      significantly affect the progression of calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly
      changes the levels of calcification promoters and inhibitors: dp-ucMGP, OC, and
      OPG.

TI  - Calcimimetic and vitamin D analog use in hemodialyzed patients is associated with
      increased levels of vitamin K dependent proteins.

AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) are two vitamin K-dependent
      proteins (VKDPs) involved in the regulation of vascular calcification (VC). We
      carried out a secondary analysis of the VIKI study to evaluate associations
      between drug consumption and VKDP levels in 387 hemodialyzed patients. The VIKI
      study assessed the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in hemodialysis patients.
      We evaluated drug consumption, determined BGP and MGP levels, and verified the
      presence of any vertebral fractures (VF) and VC by spine radiographs. Total BGP
      levels were twice as high with calcimimetics versus no calcimimetics (290 vs.
      158.5 mcg/L, p < 0.0001) and 69 % higher with vitamin D analogs (268 vs. 159
      mcg/L, p < 0.0001). Total MGP was 19 % higher with calcimimetics (21.5 vs. 18.1
      mcg/L, p = 0.04) and 54 % higher with calcium acetate (27.9 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p =
      0.003); no difference was found with vitamin D analogs (21.1 vs. 18.3 mcg/L, p = 
      0.43). Median Total BGP level was 29 % lower in patients with >/=1 VF (151 vs.
      213 mcg/L, p = 0.0091) and 36 % lower in patients with VC (164 vs. 262.1 mcg/L, p
      = 0.0003). In non-survivors, median BGP and MGP were lower, but only for MGP this
      difference reached the statistical significance (152 vs. 191 mcg/L, p = 0.20 and 
      15.0 vs. 19.7 mcg/L, p = 0.02, respectively). Pending studies on vitamin K
      supplementation, calcimimetics, and vitamin D analogs may play a role in
      preserving vitamin K-dependent protein activity, thus contributing to bone and
      vascular health in CKD patients.

AB  - While all mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) are unknown, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be
      involved in this process in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the association between ACE2 and CAC in patients on
      MHD therapy. Ninety patients on MHD therapy were involved in this prospective
      study. CAC was quantified by CAC score (CACs) using the Agatston method and a
      multi-slice CT scanner. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used
      to analyze the association between ACE2 and CACs. In the univariate analysis,
      CACs positively correlated with ACE2 (r = 0.666, P < 0.001). After adjusting for 
      age, sex, smoking, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and
      hyperlipidemia, ACE2 levels continued to significantly and independently predict 
      the presence of CAC. ROC curve analysis showed that the serum ACE2 level can
      predict the extent of CAC. These findings indicate that elevated serum ACE2 may
      be involved in vascular calcification in patients receiving MHD therapy.

TI  - High-grade proteinuria as a cardiovascular risk factor in renal transplant
      recipients.
PG  - 1170-3

LID - S0041-1345(15)00210-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteinuria is a marker of graft damage and is closely associated
      with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in kidney 
      transplant recipients (KTRs). Arterial stiffness is a well-known predictor of
      vascular calcification and systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to
      investigate the association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to
      determine whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular disease in
      our KTR population. METHODS: Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 +/- 11 years, with 
      45.9 +/- 9.6 months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in
      the 3 to 5 years of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All patients
      were evaluated for their standard clinical (age, sex, and duration of
      hemodialysis) parameters. High-grade proteinuria was defined as proteinuria >500 
      mg/day in the 24-hour urine collection. All patients were evaluated by means of
      pulse-wave velocity (PWV) measurement at the initiation of the study. RESULTS:
      Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (high-grade proteinuria) patients
      with >/=500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and group 2 (low-grade proteinuria) patients
      with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60). High-grade proteinuria was correlated with higher
      PWV measurements and lower estimated glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria
      appears to precede the elevation of serum creatinine and thus may be a useful
      marker of renal injury and may also be a contributing factor on deterioration of 
      the graft. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade (>500 mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly 
      associated with poor graft survival and increased risk of cardiovascular events. 
      In our study, we proved the significant difference between high-grade and
      low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 mg/day as the threshold of
      proteinuria in KTR population.

AB  - We assessed the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older
      living kidney donors and its effect on recipient eGFR and graft histology. A
      total of 292 consecutive living pairs with donor age >/=50 from 2003 to 2013 were
      identified (mean age 56; range 50-78; F/M: 1.8). Donor AAC was determined by
      prenephrectomy unenhanced CT. Recipient eGFR and spot urine protein: creatinine
      ratios (UPCRs) were recorded. A total of 180 recipients had 6-month protocol
      biopsies. AAC was present in 40.7% of donors, and they were older (58.6 versus
      54.7 years old, P < 0.0001) and more likely to be male (77.6% vs. 37.3%, P =
      0.004). There was no significant difference in eGFR or spot UPCR up to 36 months 
      in recipients of allografts from donors with versus without AAC. At 6-month
      biopsy, there was a higher percentage of allografts with vascular fibrous intimal
      thickening and arteriolar hyaline thickening from donors with versus without AAC 
      (vascular fibrous intimal thickening: 38.8% vs. 7.1% and arteriolar hyaline
      thickening: 35.8% vs. 7.1%; P < 0.001 for both). The presence of donor AAC
      predicts the presence of vascular disease [vascular fibrous intimal thickening
      (OR: 7.2; CI:2.9-17.9) and arteriolar hyaline thickening (OR:5.7; CI:2.3-14.1)]
      in allografts at 6 months. Donor AAC is predictive of renal vascular disease and 
      may help to improve the screening of potential donors and inform post-transplant 
      management.

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla-Protein Is Associated With Arterial Stiffness in an Adult
      Population-Based Study.
PG  - 85-92
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.115.05177 [doi]
AB  - Increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a marker of aortic stiffness and an
      independent predictor of mortality. Matrix Gla-protein (MGP) is a vascular
      calcification inhibitor that needs vitamin K to be activated. Inactive MGP, known
      as desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), can be measured in plasma and has
      been associated with various cardiovascular markers, cardiovascular outcomes, and
      mortality. In this study, we hypothesized that high levels of dp-ucMGP are
      associated with increased PWV. We recruited participants via a multicenter
      family-based cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Dp-ucMGP was quantified in
      plasma by sandwich ELISA. Aortic PWV was determined by applanation tonometry
      using carotid and femoral pulse waveforms. Multiple regression analysis was
      performed to estimate associations between PWV and dp-ucMGP adjusting for age,
      renal function, and other cardiovascular risk factors. We included 1001
      participants in our analyses (475 men and 526 women). Mean values were
      7.87+/-2.10 m/s for PWV and 0.43+/-0.20 nmol/L for dp-ucMGP. PWV was positively
      associated with dp-ucMGP both before and after adjustment for sex, age, body mass
      index, height, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, renal
      function, low- and high-density lipoprotein, glucose, smoking status, diabetes
      mellitus, BP and cholesterol lowering drugs, and history of cardiovascular
      disease (P</=0.01). In conclusion, high levels of dp-ucMGP are independently and 
      positively associated with arterial stiffness after adjustment for common
      cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and age. Experimental studies are
      needed to determine whether vitamin K supplementation slows arterial stiffening
      by increasing MGP carboxylation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease--mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are
      associated with vascular calcification and abnormal electrolytes that lead to
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. CKD-MBD is identified by imbalances in
      serum calcium (Ca), phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although the
      relation of phosphate and PTH with the prognosis of HF patients has been
      reported, the association of Ca with prognosis in patients with heart failure
      (HF) and CKD remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 191 patients
      admitted for HF and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL min(-1) 1.73
      m(-2)), and they were divided into 2 groups based on levels of corrected Ca: low 
      Ca (Ca <8.4 mg/dL; n = 32) and normal-high Ca (8.4 </=Ca; n = 159). We compared
      laboratory and echocardiographic findings, as well as followed cardiac and
      all-cause mortality. The low-Ca group had 1) higher levels of alkaline
      phosphatase (308.9 vs. 261.0 U/L; P = .026), 2) lower levels of 1,25-dihydroxy
      vitamin D (26.1 vs. 45.0 pg/mL; P = .011) and hydrogen carbonate (22.4 vs. 24.5
      mmol/L; P = .031), and 3) a tendency to have a higher PTH level (87.5 vs. 58.6
      pg/mL; P = .084). In contrast, left and right ventricular systolic function,
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein, phosphate, sodium,
      potassium, magnesium, and zinc did not differ between the 2 groups. In the
      Kaplan-Meier analysis, cardiac and all-cause mortality were significantly higher 
      in the low-Ca group than in the normal-high-Ca group (P < .05). In the
      multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, hypocalcemia was an independent
      predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD patients (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Hypocalcemia was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD
      patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of
      cardiovascular (CV) events in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Carotid-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness, also
      predicts CV events in RTR. The study investigated the relationship between CAC
      and PWV in RTR and assessed the performance of PWV measurement in predicting CAC.
      PATIENTS/METHODS: The study was performed as cross-sectional analysis in 104 RTR.
      CAC was determined as total calcium score (CS) and calcium mass (CM).
      Carotid-femoral PWV was also measured. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to assess the performance of PWV
      as diagnostic test for presence of CAC. RESULTS: CAC was found in 69% of
      participants. PWV was higher in RTR with CAC than in RTR without CAC (10.2+/-2.2 
      vs. 8.6+/-15; p<0.001). In univariate analysis CS was significantly correlated
      with age, duration of hypertension, waist circumference, PWV, hemoglobin
      concentration, and serum glucose. In multiple linear regression analysis CS was
      independently associated with age only, but not with PWV. Sensitivity and
      specificity of PWV>7.6m/s as cut-off for detecting CAC>0 was 0.889 and 0.406,
      respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of PWV>10.2m/s as cut-off for detecting
      severe CAC (CS>400) was 0.319 and 0.969, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study
      confirmed high prevalence of coronary artery calcification in renal transplant
      recipients. The study does not support the hypothesis that aortic stiffness is
      independently associated with coronary artery calcification in RTR. PWV
      measurement may be useful in excluding severe CAC in RTR.

TI  - Suboptimal vitamin K status and its risk factors in a population of Chinese
      chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 625-31
LID - 10.1111/nep.12494 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Vitamin K deficiency is known to be common in haemodialysis patients and
      associates with adverse outcomes in this population, particularly vascular
      calcification. We aimed to investigate the vitamin K status in a population of
      Chinese haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We collected demographic and
      biochemical data from a population of maintenance HD (MHD) patients in our unit
      and a control group composed of healthy subjects from our outpatient clinic.
      Fasting serum samples from all subjects were collected for the measurement of
      known vitamin K-dependent proteins i.e. matrix Gla protein (MGP), osteocalcin
      (OC) and uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC). We also quantified the fraction of
      ucOC to total OC (%ucOC). Differences of these parameters between groups were
      analyzed and risk factors of vitamin K deficiency based on the definition as per 
      %ucOC were investigated. RESULTS: We enrolled 93 MHD patients as a test group and
      93 healthy subjects as a control group. There was no significant difference in
      MGP between groups (4.0 +/- 2.8 pg/mL in MHD vs 4.2 +/- 1.2 pg/mL in control; P =
      0.676). Mean %ucOC was significantly greater in the MHD patients as compared to
      control subjects (76.4 +/- 20.0% in MHD vs 48.56 +/- 15.5%; P < 0.001). Time on
      dialysis and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level appeared to be indicators 
      of vitamin K deficiency, with the former being an independent risk factor.
      CONCLUSIONS: Defining Vitamin K deficiency by %ucOC, suboptimal vitamin K levels 
      appear common in Chinese MHD patients. Time on dialysis and LDL cholesterol level
      predict vitamin K deficiency.

PG  - 326-31
LID - 10.1177/1358863X15581448 [doi]
AB  - The cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary calcification have
      been extensively studied while those related to tibial artery calcium are less
      well defined. We sought to determine the associations between cardiovascular risk
      factors and tibial artery calcification in a cohort of patients with and without 
      significant peripheral atherosclerosis. A total of 222 patients without end-stage
      renal disease were identified in a prospectively maintained database containing
      tibial artery calcification (TAC) scores, and demographic, cardiovascular, and
      biochemical risk factor information. Patients with prevalent tibial artery
      calcification were more likely to be older, male, and have a history positive for
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients with an
      abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) or symptoms of peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) were also more likely to have higher calcium values. In analyses using
      multivariable logistic regression, age, gender, diabetes, and tobacco use
      maintained their association with prevalent tibial calcification while
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia and body mass index did not. These associations
      remained when PAD was added to the model. After adjusting for relevant
      cardiovascular risk factors, we found that only abnormal ABI, current PAD
      symptoms, and lower serum calcium values were associated with the presence of
      tibial artery calcification. In conclusion, in patients without end-stage renal
      disease, tibial artery calcification has risk factors that are similar but not
      identical to those for coronary artery calcification and peripheral
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Kidney Disease
BTI - Endotext
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) isassociatedwith amineraland
      bonedisorder(CKD-MBD)whichstarts early in the course of the disease and worsens
      with its progression. The main initial serum biochemistry abnormalities are
      increases in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      and decreases in 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) and soluble a-Klotho
      (Klotho), allowing serum calcium and phosphate to stay normal. However, in later 
      CKD stages hyperphosphatemia develops in the majority of patients, and serum 25
      hydroxy vitamin D (calcidiol) decreases. Serum calcium may stay normal, decrease,
      or increase. More recent studies suggest that circulating Wnt-b-catenin pathway
      inhibitors such as sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 also play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of CKD-MBD.Both the synthesis and the secretion of PTH are
      continuously stimulated, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism.In addition
      to the complex effects of the above systemic disturbances parathyroid tissue
      downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), and
      Klotho - a local co-receptor of cognate fibroblast growth factor receptors of
      FGF23 - further aggravates the impaired control of PTH synthesis and secretion.
      More recently, miRNAs have been shown to also contribute to the stimulation of
      the parathyroid in the uremic state. The chronic stimulation of parathyroid
      secretory function is not only characterized by a progressive rise in serum PTH
      but also by parathyroid gland hyperplasia. It results from an increase in
      parathyroid cell proliferation which is not fully compensated by a concomitant
      increase in parathyroid cell apoptosis. Parathyroid hyperplasia is initially of
      the diffuse, polyclonal type. In late CKD stages it often evolves towards a
      nodular, monoclonal or multiclonal type of growth. Enhanced parathyroid
      expression of transforming growth factor-a and its receptor, the epidermal growth
      factor receptor, is involvedin polyclonal hyperplasia.Chromosomal changes have
      been found to be associated with clonal outgrowth in some, but notthe majority of
      benign parathyroid tumors removed from patients with end-stage renal disease.In
      initial CKD stagesskeletal resistance to the action of PTH may explain why low
      bone turnover predominates in a significant proportion of patients, together with
      other conditions inhibiting bone turnover such as reduced calcitriol levels, sex 
      hormone deficiency, diabetes, and uremic toxins, leading to repression of
      osteocyte Wnt-b-catenin pathway signaling and increased expression of
      Wntantagonists such as sclerostin and Dickkopf-1. High turnover bone disease
      (osteitis fibrosa) occurs only later on, when serum PTH levels are able to
      overcome skeletal PTH resistance. The diagnosis of secondary uremic
      hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa relies at present mainly on serum
      biochemistry. X-ray examination of the skeleton is useful only in severe forms.
      It also allows assessment of concomitant vascular calcification. From a
      therapeutic point of view, it is important to prevent the development of
      secondary hyperparathyroidism as early as possible in the course of CKD. A
      variety of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are available, as outlined in 
      the final part of the chapter. For complete coverage of all related areas of

AB  - AIMS: To compare the feasibility, procedural and clinical outcomes after
      implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) in patients with calcified
      lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the feasibility of BVS implantation and
      procedural outcomes in patients with and without calcific lesions. The primary
      outcome was angiographic and procedural success. Secondary outcomes included
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Of 163 patients, 62 (38%) had
      calcified lesions. Patients with calcific lesions had a higher prevalence of
      diabetes (35.5% vs. 22.8%, p=0.078) and chronic kidney disease (31.1% vs. 13.9%, 
      p=0.008), and higher SYNTAX scores (18.9+/-9.7 vs. 15.1+/-9.0, p=0.017). Calcific
      lesions required longer procedures (126.4+/-39.8 vs. 106.9+/-37.1 min, p=0.015), 
      more frequent use of dedicated devices and IVUS. Acute gain (1.83+/-0.6 vs.
      1.86+/-0.6, p=0.732) and angiographic success were similar (98% non-calcific vs. 
      95.2% calcific, p=0.369), whereas procedural success was reduced in patients with
      calcific lesions (94.1% vs. 83.9%, p=0.034) due to higher rates of periprocedural
      myocardial infarction (MI) (5% vs. 13.1%, p=0.067). During the median follow-up
      time of 14 months MACE rates (10.9% non-calcific vs. 12.9% calcific,
      plog-rank=0.546) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Treating calcific lesions with BVS is
      feasible with high angiographic success rates, at the expense of longer procedure
      times, aggressive lesion preparation and increased rates of periprocedural MI.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin and sclerostin in chronic kidney disease prior to dialysis:
      potential partners in vascular calcifications.
PG  - 1345-56
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv081 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin and DKK1 constitute opposite bone
      turnover inhibitors, OPG inhibiting osteoclastogenesis while sclerostin and DKK1 
      exerting their inhibitory effects on osteoblastogenesis. Both proteins have been 
      recognized as strong risk factors of vascular calcifications in non-dialysis
      chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the relationships between these inhibitors and coronary artery
      calcifications (CAC) in this population. METHODS: A total of 241 ND-CKD patients 
      [143 males; 69.0 (25.0-95.0) years; median estimated glomerular filtration rate
      using CKD-EPI 35.1 (6.7-120.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were enrolled in this
      cross-sectional study. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for 
      CAC scoring. OPG, sclerostin, DKK1 and mineral metabolism markers including PTH
      and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured. Logistic regression analyses were
      used to study the relationships between CAC and these markers. RESULTS: Decline
      in renal function was associated with a significant increase in OPG and
      sclerostin while a slight but significant decrease in DKK1 was observed. The main
      crude associations with presence of CAC were a high level of OPG [OR = 2.55 95%
      confidence interval (95% CI) (1.35-4.82) for a level ranging from 6.26 to 9.15
      pmol/L and OR = 5.74 95% CI (2.87-11.5) for a level >/=9.15 pmol/L; P < 0.0001]
      and a high level of sclerostin [OR = 2.64 95% CI (1.39-5.00) for a level ranging 
      from 0.748 to 1.139 ng/mL and OR = 3.78 95% CI (1.96-7.31) for a level >/=1.139
      ng/mL; P = 0.0002]. A logistic regression model clearly showed that the risk to
      present CAC was significantly increased when both OPG (>/=6.26 pmol/L) and
      sclerostin (>/=0.748 ng/mL) levels were high [crude model: OR = 11.47 95% CI
      (4.54-29.0); P < 0.0001; model adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, body mass
      index and smoking habits: OR = 5.69 95% CI (1.76-18.4); P = 0.02]. No association
      between DKK1 and presence of CAC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly 
      suggest that bone turnover inhibitors, OPG and sclerostin, are independently
      associated with CAC with potential additive effects in ND-CKD patients.

TI  - Impact of vascular calcifications on arteriovenous fistula survival in
      hemodialysis patients: a five-year follow-up.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1159/000380823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis
      patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The 
      aim of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications
      may have on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival. METHODS: This study 
      included 90 patients (49 males, mean age 62 +/- 11) with a native AVF treated by 
      chronic hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular
      calcification scores ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access
      calcification score); patients were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36),
      moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification
      groups. AVF survival was then followed for 5 years after calcification
      measurement or until the patient's death/transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with 
      more pronounced vascular calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male.
      Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant relationship between
      calcification score and male gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF,
      low dialysis flow rate and intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate 
      adjustment for basal differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded
      impact of calcification scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated
      with a hazard rate (HR) of 3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and
      severe scores with an HR of 4.65 (CI 0.97-22.38). CONCLUSION: Vascular
      calcifications are associated with worse survival of native arteriovenous
      hemodialysis fistulas.

AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called 
      novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification
      in hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery
      calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to
      identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by 
      MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history,
      presence of >/=100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate,
      geriatric nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3,
      cinacalcet, phosphate binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation
      parameters including creatinine, albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 
      MHD patients. Coronary artery calcifications were observed in 192 patients
      (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS showed direct associations with age (p < 
      0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and presence of diabetes mellitus (p <
      0.01), and an inverse association only with active vitamin D3 administration (p <
      0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active vitamin D3 showed significantly
      lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 +/- 1635.0 vs. 2475.6 +/- 2646.6 H, p
      < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and diabetes mellitus are risk
      factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is protective factor for coronary
      artery calcification in MHD patients.

AB  - Calciphylaxis or calcific arteriolopathy is a rare, life-threatening obstructive 
      pathology of the small cutaneous and subcutaneous vessels. It mainly affects
      patients with chronic renal failure but it also has been described in patients
      with normal renal function. The principal risks factors apart from renal failure 
      and phosphocalcic metabolism imbalance are: the female sex, obesity, peripheral
      vascular disease, diabetes and oral anti-coagulation. We present a very rare case
      of abdominal, mammarian and upper thighs calciphylaxis in a patient with normal
      renal function. She presented a severe obesity with a recent important loss of
      weight and had been treated by oral anticoagulants for a long time. She benefited
      of a multidisciplinary approach with dermatologists, plastic surgeons and
      anesthesists permitting a recovery in fourteen weeks. Multidisciplinary approach 
      is necessary but the place of the surgery is not well defined. We report a case
      in which early and wide surgical approach permitted to obtain a favourable
      evolution of the pathology. Then, we propose a therapeutic strategy after review 
      of the literature.

PG  - 665-9
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12365 [doi]
AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access 
      patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of
      arterial micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD
      patients. One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) 
      operation were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial 
      arterial specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to
      identify AMiC. We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between
      positive and negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for
      evaluating risk factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF
      failure occurred in 45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was
      greater in the positive AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5%
      vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group
      had a lower AVF patency rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The
      presence of AMiC was an independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion,
      preexisting AMiC of the vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF
      failure in incident HD patients.

TI  - Association studies of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) polymorphisms with serum
      concentrations of glucose and phosphate, and vascular calcification in renal
      transplant recipients.
PG  - e0119459
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0119459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in renal
      transplant recipients (RTRs) and linked to arterial calcification. The
      calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a pivotal
      role in extracellular calcium homeostasis and is expressed in the intimal and
      medial layers of the arterial wall. We investigated whether common CASR gene
      variants are predictors for aortic and coronary artery calcification or influence
      risk factors such as serum calcium, phosphate and glucose concentrations in RTRs.
      METHODS: Two hundred and eighty four RTRs were investigated for associations
      between three CASR promoter region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      (rs115759455, rs7652589, rs1501899), three non-synonymous CASR coding region SNPs
      (A986S, R990G, Q1011E), and aortic and coronary artery calcium mass scores,
      cardiovascular outcomes and calcification risk factors that included serum
      phosphate, calcium, total cholesterol and glucose concentrations. RESULTS:
      Multivariate analysis revealed that RTRs homozygous for the minor allele (SS) of 
      the A986S SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major allele (AA), had
      raised serum glucose concentrations (8.7+/-5.4 vs. 5.7+/-2.1 mmol/L, P<0.05). In 
      addition, RTRs who were heterozygous (CT) at the rs115759455 SNP, when compared
      to those homozygous for the major allele (CC), had higher serum phosphate
      concentrations (1.1+/-0.3 vs. 1.0+/-0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05). CASR SNPs were not
      significant determinants for aortic or coronary artery calcification, and were
      not associated with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this RTR cohort.
      CONCLUSIONS: Common CASR SNPs may be independent predictors of serum glucose and 
      phosphate concentrations, but are not determinants of vascular calcification or
      cardiovascular outcomes.

TI  - [Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (Calcyphilaxis): a rare disease? Report of three 
      cases].
LID - gin/32.1.4 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA; CALCYPHILAXIS) is a syndrome
      that occurs prevalently in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. It
      is characterized by the medial calcification of skin small arteries leading to
      necrotic lesions. Several risk factors have been identified: obesity, female
      gender, diabetes mellitus, hyperphosphatemia, inflammation, treatment with
      vitamin D, calcium-based phosphate binders and warfarin. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      We report three cases of CUA observed from October 2011 to September 2014.
      RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 56 years (range 33-68). Biochemistry
      showed: mean levels of PTH=1277 pg/ml (range 1000-1696), serum calcium =10.2
      mg/dl (range 9.4-11.1), phosphorus=4.5 mg/dl (range 3.4-5.5). All patients were
      taking vitamin D, two patients were on warfarin therapy. Following actions were
      undertaken: interruption of calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D and
      warfarin therapy, initiation of cinacalcet and sodium thiosulfate therapy, use of
      dialysate with lowest available calcium concentration (1.25 mmol/l), Hyperbaric
      Oxygen Therapy, surgical dressings of skin lesions three times a week.
      Significant improvement was observed in mean levels of PTH (331 pg/ml, range
      200-465), serum calcium (8.3 mg/dl, range 7.4-9.6) and phosphorus (3.4 mg/dl,
      range 2.6-3.8). In two out of three patients complete healing of ulcerative
      lesions was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: These cases underline the importance of early 
      diagnosis of CUA especially in patients with concomitant risk factors and careful
      clinical monitoring, being CUA characterized by a rapid evolution and high
      mortality.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity in
      dialysis patients. However, it is difficult to select the proper point for
      coronary angiographic procedure, because dialysis patients frequently do not
      display typical symptoms. Vascular calcification (VC) scores of artery or aorta
      on plain radiographs are associated with CAD events and may be predictive of CAD 
      in dialysis patients. Therefore, we evaluated whether high or meaningful VC
      scores on plain radiographs are related with the severity of lesions detected by 
      coronary angiography (CAG) in dialysis patients. We retrospectively enrolled
      dialysis patients who underwent CAG and checked several plain radiographs within 
      one year before or after CAG. Significant VC is defined as high or meaningful VC 
      scores, such as long abdominal aortic calcification and medial artery
      calcification on feet. Of all 55 patients, 41 patients (74.5%) exhibited
      significant VC on plain radiographs and 23 patients (41.8%) underwent stent
      insertion. Among the 23 patients, longer stents were used in 18 patients with
      significant VC (34.1 +/- 19.5 mm vs. 16.6 +/- 15.2 mm, P = 0.029). Patients with 
      significant VC showed higher prevalence rate of severe coronary artery
      calcification (P = 0.007) and diffuse/tubular stenosis (P = 0.012), detected by
      CAG, than those without significant VC. Thus, high or meaningful VC scores on
      plain radiographs were associated with the degree of calcification or stenosis
      detected by CAG. In conclusion, VC scores on plain radiographs may be predictive 
      of calcification or stenosis of coronary artery before CAG in dialysis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular
      calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic
      hemodialysis patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis
      (Monckeberg disease). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper 
      limb plain radiographs and in duplex ultrasound images performed before
      radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only
      medial linear calcifications outlining the vessel wall were considered positive
      on X-ray images, whereas for ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic
      plaques producing bright white echos with shadowing were considered to be medial 
      calcification. A VcS was then applied in each patient. Every half of each of the 
      three main arterial conduits (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm
      was counted as 1 if it contained >/= 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas
      absence of calcification or minimum calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as
      0. Long-term all-cause mortality was compared between patients with a low or
      moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a high VcS >/= 8 (group II), and
      patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for
      comparisons among the groups. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS
      >/= 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a mean age of 68 +/-
      10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to a RCF,
      dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central venous 
      catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 +/- 
      41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 +/- 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months),
      and 66.7 +/- 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009).
      Forty-seven patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in
      the controls; P = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%,
      65.7%, 54.8%, and 48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II;
      and 97.7%, 93.1%, 76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 
      for all groups; P = .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or 
      without CVCs at baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc 
      had lower survival rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%)
      and at 3 years (47.7% vs 75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of
      death only in subgroup II patients compared with the subcontrol group patients
      (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, respectively; P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic
      hemodialysis patients exposed to high levels of upper extremity arterial medial
      VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased long-term mortality risk compared with
      diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and receiving the same access. Patients
      with CVCs/Vc had the lowest survival rates.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the first leading cause of death in
      hemodialysis patients. In this population, cardiovascular calcifications occur at
      an earlier age and progress faster than in general population. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: In order to determine the prevalence and risk factors of cardiac
      calcifications, 49 patients on chronic hemodialysis were screened in the coronary
      arteries and cardiac valves by the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT and the
      transthoracic echocardiography. Different clinical and biological parameters were
      studied by the SPSS 10.0 statistical software to determine risk factors. RESULT: 
      Cardiac calcifications were identified in 81.6% of cases in at least one of the
      two studied sites. The coronary artery involvement was more common than valvular 
      and concerned 69.4% of cases. The mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score
      (ACACS) was 331.1 and 522.2 in coronary patients and was correlated to alteration
      of systolic function of LV (r=-0.287, P=0.045). The severity of CACS was
      positively correlated with age (r=0.332, P=0.02). Coronary calcifications were
      associated with cardiovascular risk common to those of the general population
      (age, male sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, history of ischemic heart
      disease), but also to a lesser quality of dialysis. Valvular calcifications were 
      present in 49% of cases and were correlated with left ventricular hypertrophy
      (P=0.006). The exclusive involvement of the aortic valve was the most common
      valvular abnormality. Phosphocalcic and lipid parameters, levels of hemoglobin,
      CRP and uric acid did not predisposed to cardiac calcifications in our patients. 
      DISCUSSION: In hemodialysis patients, the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
      calcification is complex and cannot be attributed to a passive process. This
      process involves several factors that can promote or inhibit calcification. The
      new multi-slice ultra-fast scanner is a very sensitive method for topographic and
      quantitative assessment of coronary calcification and is a better alternative to 
      invasive techniques. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high prevalence of
      cardiac calcification in hemodialysis, and highlights the importance of early
      screening and treatment of predisposing factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) often fail to mature, but the mechanism
      of AVF nonmaturation is poorly understood. Arterial microcalcification is common 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may limit vascular dilatation, 
      thereby contributing to early postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis and
      impaired AVF maturation. This study evaluated whether preexisting arterial
      microcalcification adversely affects AVF outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective
      study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 127 patients with CKD undergoing AVF surgery at a 
      large academic medical center. PREDICTORS: Preexisting arterial
      microcalcification (>/=1% of media area) assessed independently by von Kossa
      stains of arterial specimens obtained during AVF surgery and by preoperative
      ultrasound. OUTCOMES: Juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis (ascertained by ultrasound
      obtained 4-6 weeks postoperatively), AVF nonmaturation (inability to cannulate
      with 2 needles with dialysis blood flow >/= 300mL/min for >/=6 sessions in 1
      month within 6 months of AVF creation), and duration of primary unassisted AVF
      survival after successful use (time to first intervention). RESULTS: Arterial
      microcalcification was present by histologic evaluation in 40% of patients
      undergoing AVF surgery. The frequency of a postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF
      stenosis was similar in patients with or without preexisting arterial
      microcalcification (32% vs 42%; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28-1.52; P=0.3). AVF
      nonmaturation was observed in 29%, 33%, 33%, and 33% of patients with <1%, 1% to 
      4.9%, 5% to 9.9%, and >/=10% arterial microcalcification, respectively (P=0.9).
      Sonographic arterial microcalcification was found in 39% of patients and was
      associated with histologic calcification (P=0.001), but did not predict AVF
      nonmaturation. Finally, among AVFs that matured, unassisted AVF maturation (time 
      to first intervention) was similar for patients with and without preexisting
      arterial microcalcification (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21; P=0.2). LIMITATIONS:
      Single-center study. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial microcalcification is common in
      patients with advanced CKD, but does not explain postoperative AVF stenosis, AVF 
      nonmaturation, or AVF failure after successful cannulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral
      cholecalciferol treatment on vascular calcification, left ventricular mass index 
      (LVMI) and other cardiac functions in dialysis patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: A
      six-month course of oral cholecalciferol treatment was recommended to dialysis
      patients with vitamin D insufficiency. While 26 patients were given
      cholecalciferol treatment, 17 patients who could not tolerate to therapy received
      standard therapy. Initial biochemical parameters were measured, and they were
      measured again after 6 months of treatment. Echocardiographic measurements were
      also performed, and the vascular calcification score (VCS) was calculated at
      baseline and at the 6th month. RESULTS: The cholecalciferol replacement group
      showed no significant change in LVMI and VCS values (p > 0.05). However, while
      LVMI was similar between groups at initial evaluation, it was lower in the
      cholecalciferol group at the 6th month when compared to the standard treatment
      group (141.8 +/- 40.2 g/m(2) vs. 166.3 +/- 31.4 g/m(2); p = 0.04). Likewise, left
      ventricular diastolic diameters (48.8 +/- 5.1 mm vs. 47.5 +/- 4.6 mm; p = 0.023) 
      and left atrial diameters (41.2 +/- 8.9 mm vs. 38.9 +/- 8.1 mm; p = 0.006)
      decreased in the cholecalciferol group. Additionally, significant increases were 
      observed in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and albumin levels, with a
      significant decrease in serum C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSION: A lesser
      increase in left ventricular mass and better diastolic functions was observed in 
      dialysis patients after 6 months of cholecalciferol treatment.

TI  - Vascular calcification and bone mineral density in recurrent kidney stone
      formers.
PG  - 278-85
LID - 10.2215/CJN.06030614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent epidemiologic studies have provided evidence
      for an association between nephrolithiasis and cardiovascular disease, although
      the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Vascular calcification (VC) is a
      strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and the hypothesis explored in this 
      study is that VC is more prevalent in calcium kidney stone formers (KSFs). The
      aims of this study were to determine (1) whether recurrent calcium KSFs have more
      VC and osteoporosis compared with controls and (2) whether hypercalciuria is
      related to VC in KSFs. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a
      retrospective, matched case-control study that included KSFs attending an
      outpatient nephrology clinic of the Royal Free Hospital (London, UK) from 2011 to
      2014. Age- and sex-matched non-stone formers were drawn from a list of potential 
      living kidney donors from the same hospital. A total of 111 patients were
      investigated, of which 57 were KSFs and 54 were healthy controls. Abdominal
      aortic calcification (AAC) and vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed
      using available computed tomography (CT) imaging. The prevalence, severity, and
      associations of AAC and CT BMD between KSFs and non-stone formers were compared. 
      RESULTS: Mean age was 47+/-14 years in KSFs and 47+/-13 in non-stone formers. Men
      represented 56% and 57% of KSFs and non-stone formers, respectively. The
      prevalence of AAC was similar in both groups (38% in KSFs versus 35% in controls,
      P=0.69). However, the AAC severity score (median [25th percentile, 75th
      percentile]) was significantly higher in KSFs compared with the control group (0 
      [0, 43] versus 0 [0, 10], P<0.001). In addition, the average CT BMD was
      significantly lower in KSFs (159+/-53 versus 194 +/-48 Hounsfield units,
      P<0.001). A multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, high BP, diabetes, smoking 
      status, and eGFR confirmed that KSFs have higher AAC scores and lower CT BMD
      compared with non-stone formers (P<0.001 for both). Among stone formers, the
      association between AAC score and hypercalciuria was not statistically
      significant (P=0.86). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients with
      calcium kidney stones suffer from significantly higher degrees of aortic
      calcification than age- and sex-matched non-stone formers, suggesting that VC may
      be an underlying mechanism explaining reported associations between
      nephrolithiasis and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, bone demineralization is
      more prominent in KSFs. However, more data are needed to confirm the possibility 
      of potentially common underlying mechanisms leading to extraosseous calcium
      deposition and osteoporosis in KSFs.

      maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 658-67
LID - 10.1159/000368476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple 
      assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is
      associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted 
      a prospective study to investigate factors associated with the presence at
      baseline and progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic
      value in a short-term outcome. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays
      in 301 asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three
      Grades (0, 1, 2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage,
      co-morbidity and biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then
      followed for 3 years. RESULTS: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade
      0, in 112 patients (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 
      3 at baseline. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with
      older male patients who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up
      period of 3 years, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that
      high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality. Patients with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival
      analysis and the grade of AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause
      death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups than in the
      non-progression groups. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC
      assessed by chest X-ray were independently associated with mortality in MHD
      patients. Regular follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to
      stratify mortality risk in MHD patients.

TI  - [MORPHOGENETIC PROTEINS--FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR AND KLOTHO, IN THE SERA OF
      PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE].
PG  - 32-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of morphogenetic
      proteins--fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and extracellular form (alpha) of 
      Klotho protein, present in the sera of patients with chronic renal disease (CRD) 
      as markers of cardiovascular risk. The study included 130 patients (64 men and 66
      women) with stage I-VD CRD. The patients'age was 20-65 (mean 41 +/- 6.7) years.
      30 of them had chronic glomerulonephritis, 23 chronic tubulointerstitial
      nephritis, 28 hypertensive nephrosclerosis, 22 polycystic kidneys, 27 type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were standardfor clinical
      studies of CRD patients. Control group contained 30 healthy volunteers matched
      for age and sex. The patients were uniformly distributed by stages of CRD in
      terms of age and sex (18-20 per group). All of them were followed up during 1
      year Standard clinical and laboratory examination was supplemented by the
      measurement of the parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca and P levels. Serum FGF-23 and
      Klotho levels were determined by ELISA before and 1 year after onset of the
      study. Blood pressure including brachial (peripheral) and aortic (central) one as
      swell as the pulse wave velocity was measured by a Sphygocorr apparatus
      (Australia). Other studies included ECG, EchoCG, and X-ray of abdominal aorta in 
      the lateral projection using the Kaupilla method. Comparison of FGF-23 and Klotho
      levels in patients at different stages of CRD revealed their decrease with
      decreasing glomerular filtration rate that started before (at IIIA stage) a rise 
      in the serum P and PTG levels (IV-V stage). Negative relationship was documented 
      between the Klotho level and the degree of cardiac calcinosis estimated from a
      semi-quantitative scale (r = 0.64; p < 0.01). Serum FGF-23 significantly
      correlated wiht myocardial remodeling (r = 0.612; p < 0.01). Multiple regression 
      analysis showed that patients with elevated FGF-23 and P levels, high central
      systolic pressure and pulse wave velocity had greater left ventricular myocardium
      mass. ROC-analysis demonstrated that FGF-23 level over 412 pg/ml is indicative of
      left ventricular hypertrophy with sensitivity 80% and specificity 76%. Patients
      undergoing hemodialysis who died within 1 year after the onset of the treatment
      had a higher FGF-23 level than survivals on hemodialysis. The risk of death
      during the first year on hemodialysis correlated with the FGF-23 level (r =
      0.564, p < 0.01). ROC-analysis showed that Klotho levels below 387 pg/ml
      suggested an increased risk of myocardiym calcification with sensitivity 80% and 
      specificity 75%. It is concluded that morphogenetic proteins, fibroblast growth
      factor and Klotho, not only play an important role in mineral metabolism in
      patients with CRD but also produce pleiotropic effects on the development of
      cardiovascular complications (via involvement in cardiac and vascular
      calcification and remodeling). It provides a basis for the use of these proteins 
      as early markers of cardiovascular risk in CRD patients.

TI  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary hypertension in older 
      patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria.
PG  - 353-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-014-0889-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary vascular calcification 
      and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a chronic kidney failure dog model, and
      increased prevalence of PH and a PH-hyperparathyroidism relationship in
      pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis patients are reported.
      This study investigated the prevalence of PH and relationships between PH and
      metabolic abnormalities in patients with stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD. METHODS:
      One-hundred and ninety patients (mean age 61 +/- 17.4, 116 males) with
      proteinuria CKD and no coronary diseases, congestive heart failure, smoking
      history, and pulmonary diseases were enrolled. Estimated glomerular filtration
      rate was 39.7 +/- 23 ml/min. CKD etiology was diabetes mellitus in 52 (27.3 %),
      chronic glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis in 56 (29.4 %),
      hypertension in 36 (19 %), and other etiologies (nephrolithiasis, obstructive
      nephropathy, and amyloidosis) in 46 (25.3 %) patients. Echocardiography was
      performed, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left ventricular
      ejection fraction were determined. Laboratory tests examined lipid parameters,
      serum albumin, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein,
      parathyroid hormone, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels. RESULTS: PH (PAP >35 mmHg) 
      was detected in 68 patients (35.9 %). Patients with PH were older (68 +/- 12.3
      vs. 52.1 +/- 16.7, p = 0.03), had lower ejection fractions (51.3 +/- 13.4 vs.
      60.8 +/- 9.1 %, p = 0.003), lower hemoglobin (11.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 12.1 +/- 1.9, p = 
      0.05), and higher parathyroid hormone (218 +/- 159.3 vs. 127.7 +/- 67.4 pg/ml, p 
      = 0.05) levels. The remaining parameters were similar between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Older age, lower ejection fraction, and secondary
      hyperparathyroidism may contribute to PH in stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD.

TI  - Peritoneal dialysis per se is a risk factor for sclerostin-associated adynamic
      bone disease.
PG  - 1039-45
LID - 10.1038/ki.2014.372 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome
      influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and
      dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients,
      only a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of
      these older studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal 
      osteodystrophy in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was
      adynamic bone disease (49%). There was a significant inverse association between 
      serum sclerostin (a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast 
      action and bone formation) and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase
      had the best sensitivity and specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover
      diseases. The comparison between nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, 
      gender, parathyroid hormone level, and length of dialysis, revealed low
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone mineralization, and low bone turnover in
      the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic bone disease was the most frequent type 
      of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. Sclerostin seems to participate in the
      pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and bone alkaline phosphatase was the
      best serum marker of bone turnover in these patients.

TI  - Neointimal hyperplasia and calcification in medium sized arteries in adult
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - E35-40
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12335 [doi]
AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis
      vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This
      study examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in
      brachial and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven
      radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine
      predialysis and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender
      matched controls undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation 
      (6 renal). Arterial stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology,
      morphometric analysis of intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load 
      was performed using standard techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients
      demonstrated significant arterial intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio
      higher than controls (0.13 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.02 +/- 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium
      deposition was demonstrated on histology and the calcium content in patients was 
      higher than controls (34.68 +/- 26.86 vs. 10.95 +/- 9.18 mug/mug, p = 0.003). The
      blood vessel calcium content correlated with arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p =
      0.018). This study for the first time describes, and suggests mechanistic linkage
      between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium deposition, and increased
      functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis patients. Our research 
      could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the uremic vasculature 
      impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently
      related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study
      evaluated the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in
      non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc 
      cross sectional analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward
      CKD patients without manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 +/- 11.0 years, 
      64.1% males, 95.1% hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 
      2 to 5 with estimated glomerular filtration rate 36.8 +/- 18.1 ml/min). CAC
      scores, PF volume and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by
      computed tomography. The association of PF as a continuous variable with the
      presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. CAC (calcium
      score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those presenting CAC were on average 10
      years older, had a higher proportion of male gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001),
      and had higher values of waist circumference (95.9 +/- 10.7 vs. 90.2 +/- 13.2 cm,
      p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 +/- 107.6 vs. 139.1 +/- 85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF
      areas (109.2 +/- 81.5 vs. 70.2 +/- 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the multivariate
      analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left ventricular
      concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the presence of CAC 
      (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained associated with 
      CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular filtration rate or 
      serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is independently
      associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

TI  - Serum sclerostin is an independent predictor of mortality in hemodialysis
      patients.
PG  - 190
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-15-190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone
      remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is
      also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study
      was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. METHODS: we
      measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during 
      a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the
      follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death.
      RESULTS: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3+/-18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of
      diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney
      transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl
      and lower creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and
      higher Scl (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by 
      competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as
      creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly
      related to higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of
      mortality in dialysis patients. However, whether clinical interventions to

TI  - Vitamin K status and mortality after kidney transplantation: a cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification
      inhibitors such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients,
      vitamin K insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are
      unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal
      design. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men;
      mean age, 51+/-12 (SD) years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney
      transplantation. FACTOR: Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP)
      levels, reflecting vitamin K status. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant
      failure. RESULTS: At inclusion, median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) 
      pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as
      dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 
      (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) developed transplant failure. Patients in the
      highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at considerably higher mortality risk compared 
      with patients in the lowest quartile (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for
      trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). After adjustment for potential
      confounders, including kidney function and exclusion of patients treated with a
      vitamin K antagonist, this association remained significant. Patients in the
      highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing transplant failure (HR,
      2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.01), but this
      association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney function (HR, 1.20; 95%
      CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7). LIMITATIONS: Although MGP
      exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No data were available for
      vascular calcification as an intermediate end point. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K
      insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, is highly prevalent
      in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated independently with
      increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address whether vitamin K
      supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney transplantation.

PG  - 127-34
LID - 10.1159/000366449 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of bone formation, but the meaning
      of its serum levels remains undetermined. We evaluated the association between
      sclerostin levels and clinical or biological data in hemodialyzed patients (HD), 
      notably parathormone (PTH), biomarkers of bone turnover, vascular calcifications 
      and mortality after 2 years. METHODS: 164 HD patients were included in this
      observational study. The calcification score was assessed with the Kauppila
      method. Patients were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: Median sclerostin levels
      were significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in HD versus healthy subjects (n = 94)
      (1,375 vs. 565 pg/ml, respectively). In univariate analysis a significant
      association (p < 0.05) was found between sclerostin and age, height, dialysis
      vintage, albumin, troponin, homocysteine, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen
      type I, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteoprotegerin, but not with the 
      calcification score. In a multivariate model, the association remained with age, 
      height, dialysis vintage, troponin, homocysteine, phosphate, PTH, but also with
      vascular calcifications. Association was positive for all variables, except PTH
      and vascular calcifications. The baseline sclerostin concentration was not
      different in survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm a higher
      concentration of sclerostin in HD patients, a positive association with age and a
      negative association with PTH. A positive association with phosphate,
      homocysteine and troponin calls for additional research. The clinical interest of
      sclerostin to assess vascular calcifications in HD is limited and no association 
      was found between sclerostin and mortality.

PG  - F1302-11
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00114.2014 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the
      present study, we investigated the potential involvement of endothelial
      microparticles (MPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the generation of
      VC in CKD patients. The number of circulating EMPs is greater in patients with VC
      than without VC (307 +/- 167 vs. 99 +/- 75 EMPs/mul, P < 0.001). The percentage
      of EPCs is significantly lower in patient with VC than in patients without VC
      (0.14 +/- 0.11% vs. 0.25 +/- 0.18%, P = 0.002). The number of EPCs expressing
      osteocalcin (OCN) was higher in VC patients (349 +/- 63 cells/100,000) than in
      non-VC patients (139 +/- 75 cells/100,000, P < 0.01). In vitro, MPs obtained from
      CKD patients were able to induce OCN expression in EPCs from healthy donors; the 
      increase in OCN expression was more accentuated if MPs were obtained from CKD
      patients with VC. MPs from CKD patients also induced OCN expression in vascular
      smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. In CKD patients, the rise in endothelial MPs
      associated with a decrease in the number of EPCs, suggesting an imbalance in the 
      processes of endothelial damage and repair in CKD patients, mainly those with VC.
      Our results suggest that EPCs, through OCN expression, may directly participate
      in the process of VC.

TI  - Clinical outcome following second-generation drug-eluting stent use for off-label
      versus on-label indications: insights from the two-year outcome of the TWENTE
      trial.
PG  - 664-71

LID - EIJV10I6A117 [pii]
AB  - AIMS: Drug-eluting stents (DES) were first used on-label - in simple patients
      with low clinical risk and easily accessible lesions. Currently, DES are
      increasingly used off-label - in complex patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary interventions (PCI) with historically higher event risk. Therefore, our 
      aim was to investigate whether patients with off-label indications for DES use
      had similar outcomes compared to patients who were treated for on-label
      indications only. We analysed two-year follow-up data of 1,387 TWENTE trial
      patients, treated with second-generation everolimus-eluting XIENCE V or
      zotarolimus-eluting Resolute stents, and compared off-label vs. on-label DES use 
      with regard to the following clinical endpoints: cardiac death, myocardial
      infarction (MI), periprocedural MI (</=48 hrs), and target vessel
      revascularisation (TVR). Patients with off-label DES use (n=1,033; 74.5%) had
      more diabetes (22.9% vs. 17.5%; p=0.032), previous MI (35.9% vs. 22.3%; p<0.001),
      type B2/C lesions (84.7% vs. 62.7%; p<0.001), and acute coronary syndromes (57.8%
      vs. 33.3%; p<0.001). Nevertheless, cardiac death and TVR rates were similar to
      those of patients with on-label DES use (p>0.8). Following off-label DES use,
      there was a higher incidence of PMI (5.0% vs. 1.4%; p=0.003), of which only 1.1% 
      reached creatine kinase levels >5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Despite
      differences in risk profile, patients with off-label DES use did not differ from 
      patients with on-label DES use in clinical endpoints other than periprocedural
      MI. These largely positive findings underline the favourable safety profile of
      second-generation DES.

TI  - Observational multicenter study to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of
      subclinical atheromatosis in a Spanish chronic kidney disease cohort: baseline
      data from the NEFRONA study.
PG  - 168
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-15-168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events (CVE) are more prevalent in chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of morbimortality.
      Specific risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional
      factors do not fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates.
      However, the role of atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still
      unclear. The potential use of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical
      atheromatosis has to be determined. METHODS: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter
      cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and
      dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74
      years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were 
      also recruited. Demographical, clinical and analytical data were collected.
      Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a single trained team to
      measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect atheromatous plaques.
      Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured. RESULTS: Differences in age, sex and
      prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found between controls
      and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described in
      epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls
      and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted);
      earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of
      atheromatous plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted
      analysis. A group of patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were
      plaque-free in carotid arteries, and would have gone underdiagnosed without the
      femoral study. The percentage of pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher
      prevalence in more advanced stages, and a higher rate of ABI >1.4 than <0.9,
      suggesting more vascular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: NEFRONA is the first large
      study describing the actual prevalence of subclinical atheromatosis across
      different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of atheromatous plaques and
      pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important information to the
      pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to non-CKD subjects.

LID - 10.1159/000362862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in
      the general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI
      on CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      not on dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis
      initiation, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. METHODS: CKD
      patients were divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of
      dialysis, and extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and
      multivariable analysis were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes,
      hypertension, gender, CKD stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid
      hormone, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total
      calcium score, 24-hour proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event
      (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 years. RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE
      occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients,
      respectively. High BMI did not increase the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR:
      1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI:
      0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not increase the risk for initiation of
      dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable
      analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 0.14). Adding the interaction term
      (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to other variables, the risk of
      dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p =
      0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of CAC extent or
      progression. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High BMI
      increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to
      CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the
      impact of high BMI on dialysis initiation.

TI  - Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla protein concentration is predictive of
      vitamin K status and is correlated with vascular calcification in a cohort of
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-15-145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is known to act as a potent local inhibitor 
      of vascular calcifications. However, in order to be active, MGP must be
      phosphorylated and carboxylated, with this last process being dependent on
      vitamin K. The present study focused on the inactive form of MGP
      (dephosphorylated and uncarboxylated: dp-ucMGP) in a population of hemodialyzed
      (HD) patients. Results found in subjects being treated or not with vitamin K
      antagonist (VKA) were compared and the relationship between dp-ucMGP levels and
      the vascular calcification score were assessed. METHODS: One hundred sixty
      prevalent HD patients were enrolled into this observational cohort study,
      including 23 who were receiving VKA treatment. The calcification score was
      determined (using the Kauppila method) and dp-ucMGP levels were measured using
      the automated iSYS method. RESULTS: dp-ucMGP levels were much higher in patients 
      being treated with VKA and little overlap was found with those not being treated 
      (5604 [3758; 7836] vs. 1939 [1419; 2841] pmol/L, p < 0.0001). In multivariate
      analysis, treatment with VKA was the most important variable explaining variation
      in dp-ucMGP levels even when adjusting for all other significant variables. In
      the 137 untreated patients, dp-ucMGP levels were significantly (p < 0.05)
      associated both in the uni- and multivariate analysis with age, body mass index, 
      plasma levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, and FGF-23, and the vascular
      calcification score. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the concentration of dp-ucMGP 
      was higher in HD patients being treated with VKA. We observed a significant
      correlation between dp-ucMGP concentration and the calcification score. Our data 
      support the theoretical role of MGP in the development of vascular
      calcifications. We confirmed the potential role of the inactive form of MGP in
      assessing the vitamin K status of the HD patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

PG  - 2449-65
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12648 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), erectile dysfunction (ED), and
      cardiovascular disease share common vascular etiologies and risk factors. AIM:
      Using a rat model, this is the first study to characterize the consequences of
      CKD in the onset and development of ED associated with differential regional
      vascular calcification and circulatory changes. METHODS: Stable CKD was generated
      at 3 weeks in male Sprague-Dawley rats given dietary adenine and progressed until
      7 weeks. Mineral content and morphometry were assessed in the internal pudendal
      arteries (IPAs), thoracic aorta, and carotid artery. Endothelial function was
      determined via changes in serum von Willebrand factor (VWF) and
      endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta. RESULTS: In severe CKD
      rats, calcium and phosphate content in all arteries increased, and pulse wave
      velocity was elevated. Distal IPA segments, in particular, were the first to
      calcify, but penile tissue per se did not. CKD rats had endothelial dysfunction, 
      as indicated by a decrease in acetylcholine-mediated relaxation ( approximately
      40%) and an increase in serum VWF ( approximately 40%), as well as increased
      lumen diameter (20%) of the distal IPA. Erectile function, assessed using a
      centrally acting dopaminergic agent, was significantly impaired by 7 weeks (
      approximately 40%). CONCLUSIONS: In CKD, the distal IPA appears to be more
      susceptible to vascular dysfunction and calcification. Additionally, the onset of
      ED may be an important sentinel of impending systemic vascular disease. To
      confirm this concept, future experimental and clinical studies will need to
      examine a range of vessel types and the use of supplementary methods to assess
      erectile function.

TI  - Arterial location-specific calcification at the carotid artery and aortic arch
      for chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
PG  - 267-74
LID - 10.1007/s00223-014-9891-2 [doi]
AB  - Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but
      controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and
      dyslipidemia in altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three
      different arterial locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid 
      artery (ICA) origins. Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and 
      its orifices were evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed
      tomography angiography in 397 patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted
      for age, gender, CKD, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking status.
      Additionally, subgroup analyses in each variable were conducted. Our multivariate
      logistic regression analyses revealed that CKD was significantly associated with 
      the outside-wall calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM was only associated
      with the inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased 
      the association between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its
      orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was significantly
      associated with the calcification at the orifices of the aortic arch branches
      synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have any significant association
      with calcification in any of the three vascular beds. CKD had the highest
      prevalence risk of calcification in common with the three different vascular
      beds. CKD in combination with DM, as well as hypertension in combination with
      CKD, were key relationships affecting the risk of arterial calcification,
      especially at the aortic arch and its orifices.

TI  - The role of fetuin-A in cardiac functions and metabolism in peritoneal dialysis
      patients.
PG  - 375-82
AB  - AIM: Fetuin-A is a member of protease inhibitors that act as an inhibitor of
      vascular calcification. In our study, the relationship of fetuin-A with metabolic
      and echocardiographic parameters in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been
      investigated. METHODS: Besides demographic, clinical and laboratory data,
      fetuin-A level was recorded. Echocardiographic examinations were performed by the
      same operator. RESULTS: Fifty-two chronic PD patients (mean age: 52.7 +/- 15.4
      years) and 31 healthy volunteers (mean age: 41.3 +/- 10.7 years) were included.
      Fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in the patient group (57.5 +/- 31.5
      ng/mL vs. 72.5 +/- 34.0 ng/mL, P = 0.002). There was a significant relation
      between age and fetuin-A levels (P = 0.025). Four patients with chronic heart
      failure had significantly lower fetuin-A levels compared with those without.
      There was no relation between fetuin-A levels and the presence of diabetes
      mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease. No
      relationship was detected between fetuin-A level and any echocardiographic
      parameter. Age and hematocrite were correlated negatively, and serum albumin
      positively with fetuin-A levels. On linear regression analysis, fetuin-A level
      was related with age, hematocrite and presence of heart failure. CONCLUSION: PD
      patients with heart failure have significantly lower fetuin-A levels. Age is a
      main determinant of fetuin-A level and fetuin-A may act as a negative acute phase
      reactant in PD patients.

TI  - The relationship between the Spine Deformity Index, biochemical parameters of

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures
      (VFs), providing information on both their number and severity. METHODS: We
      evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical and arterial
      calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, assessed by
      quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were identified
      in the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of fracture severity, 
      we created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the number of VFs. We
      assessed routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), undercaboxylated BGP
      (ucBGP), and matrix-Gla-protein (MGP). RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD
      patients with a SDI >1 were more frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP
      (p<0.01). Patients with a c-SDI >1 had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower 
      ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP (p<0.05). Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC)
      were more frequent in patients with SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05).
      Multivariate logistic regression showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91),
      age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) and albumin >/=3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were 
      predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI
      1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, CI 0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity of VFs was associated with age,
      atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

TI  - Skin autofluorescence associates with vascular calcification in chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 1784-90
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between tissue advanced
      glycation end products, as reflected by skin autofluorescence, and vascular
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Three hundred
      patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease underwent multislice computed
      tomography to estimate total coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and had tissue 
      advanced glycation end product assessed using a skin autofluorescence reader.
      Intact parathyroid hormone (P<0.001) displaced estimated glomerular filtration
      rate as third most significant factor associated with skin autofluorescence after
      age (P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (P<0.001) in multiple regression analysis. On
      univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, every 1-U increase in skin
      autofluorescence was associated with a 7.43-fold (95% confidence intervals,
      3.59-15.37; P<0.001) increased odds of having CACS >/=400 compared with those
      with zero CACS. Skin autofluorescence retained significance in predicting CACS
      >/=400 (odds ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.44-9.18; P=0.006) when
      adjusting for age, sex, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, C-reactive protein,
      lipids, blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intact
      parathyroid hormone but marginally lost significance when additionally adjusting 
      for diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% confidence intervals, 0.81-6.14;
      P=0.1). Combination of diabetes mellitus and higher intact parathyroid hormone
      was associated with greater skin autofluorescence and CACS versus those without
      diabetes mellitus and having lower intact parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS:
      Tissue advanced glycation end product, as reflected by skin autofluorescence,
      showed a significant novel association with vascular calcification in chronic
      kidney disease. These data suggest that increased tissue advanced glycation end
      product may contribute to vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease and
      diabetes mellitus and warrant further experimental investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic
      kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests
      correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D) levels<30ng/mL in patients treated with
      maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a specific treatment protocol.
      STUDY DESIGN: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial
      followed by a 26-week open-label study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 55 adult
      maintenance hemodialysis patients with 25(OH)D levels<30ng/mL were recruited from
      June 2008 through October 2009. INTERVENTION: Cholecalciferol, 25,000IU, per week
      orally versus placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of individualized
      cholecalciferol prescription based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney
      Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines. OUTCOMES:
      Primary end point was the percentage of patients with 25(OH)D levels>/=30ng/mL at
      13 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with normal
      calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) blood levels. Safety
      measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D.
      MEASUREMENTS: Blood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; iPTH, 25(OH)D,
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, trimonthly;
      fetuin A and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and aortic
      calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39. RESULTS: The primary end 
      point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo
      group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P<0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26]
      vs 11 [IQR, 10-15]pg/mL; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the
      target calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P=0.03). Incidence of hypercalcemia and
      phosphate and iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26-week study
      phase did not significantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level>/=30ng/mL in
      patients issued from the placebo group. LIMITATIONS: Small size of the study
      population. CONCLUSIONS: Oral weekly administration of 25,000IU of
      cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an effective, safe, inexpensive, and manageable
      way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels in hemodialysis patients. Further
      evaluation of clinical end points is suggested.

TI  - Sequence variation in vitamin K epoxide reductase gene is associated with
      survival and progressive coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1591-6
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sequence variations in the gene(s) encoding vitamin K epoxide
      reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), the enzyme target of warfarin, have been
      associated with increased cardiovascular disease in the general population.
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease
      in chronic kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that the VKORC1 rs8050894 CC 
      genotype would be associated with mortality and progression of CAC </= 4 years.
      APPROACH AND RESULTS: This study is an observational, prospective study of 167
      individuals with stages 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease. Survival </= 4 years was
      assessed in all participants, and CAC progression was measured in a subset of 86 
      patients. Participants with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had higher baseline CAC 
      scores (median score, 112 versus 299; P=0.036). Of those 86 patients who had a
      4-year CAC score, those with the CG/GG genotype had an increased risk of
      progressive CAC (adjusted for age, diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular
      filtration rate, and hypertension) compared with those with the CC genotype.
      Four-year mortality risk was 4 times higher for individuals with the CG/GG
      genotypes compared with individuals with the CC genotype (odds ratio, 3.8; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.2-12.5; P=0.02), adjusted for age, sex, diabetes mellitus,
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline CAC, and hypertension.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had a higher risk of CAC 
      progression and a poorer survival. These data provide new perspectives on the
      potential extrahepatic role of VKORC1 in individuals with chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Calcification of the aortic arch predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.1159/000360230 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification represents a marker of cardiovascular
      risk in chronic dialysis patients. In the general population, aortic arch
      calcification (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a
      prospective study to investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis
      patients and examined its prognostic value in long-term outcome. METHODS: A total
      of 712 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. AAC was identified on
      postero-anterior chest X-ray films and classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 3.
      Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and
      biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The patients were followed for 10
      years. RESULTS: AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) as Gr. 1, in 116 patients
      (16.3%) as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An increase in the
      severity of calcification was associated with older patients who had lower
      albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10
      years, we found that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular
      mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p < 0.05)
      and all-cause mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3:
      53.2%; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that
      high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause
      mortality. Patients with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival
      analysis. The severity of AAC also influenced their survival. CONCLUSION:
      Calcification of the aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography was an
      important determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in chronic
      hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted long-term
      survival.

AB  - It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are
      simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone
      health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney 
      disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of
      microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture 
      of the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
      (HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the
      lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery
      calcification using multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured
      in 66 patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of
      bone turnover, vitamin D status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were
      assessed. CAC score was found to be <100 in 39% and >/=100 in 61% of patients.
      The median [95% CI] total CAC score was 282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis,
      significant correlations between CAC and age (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3,
      p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, p<0.01) were found, and parameters of
      bone microarchitecture were numerically but not significantly lower in patients
      with CAC scores >/=100. In multivariate analysis stratifying for gender and
      correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone volume/total volume (BV/TV)
      were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores >/=100 (p<0.05 for both).
      Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone density are associated
      with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.

TI  - Active vitamin D and accelerated progression of aortic stiffness in hemodialysis 
      patients: a longitudinal observational study.
PG  - 1346-54
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpu057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that high-dose active vitamin D therapy in the form
      of alphacalcidol (alpha-calcidol), used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in
      chronic kidney disease, could lead to vascular calcification and accelerated
      progression of aortic stiffness. METHODS: We conducted an observational study in 
      85 patients on chronic hemodialysis, among which 70 were taking a weekly dose of 
      alpha-calcidol of <2 microg and 15 were taking a weekly dose of >/=2 microg
      (pharmacological dose). Parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fibroblast
      growth factor 23, and alpha-klotho were determined. Aortic stiffness was assessed
      by determination of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) at baseline and 
      after a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. A multivariable regression model was used to
      evaluate the impact of pharmacological dose of alpha-calcidol on the progression 
      of aortic stiffness. RESULTS: At baseline, clinical, biological, and hemodynamic 
      parameters were similar. At follow-up, cf-PWV increased more in patients with
      pharmacological dose of alpha-calcidol (0.583+/-2.291 m/s vs. 1.948+/-1.475 m/s; 
      P = 0.04). After adjustment for changes in mean blood pressure and duration of
      follow-up, pharmacological dose of alpha-calcidol was associated with a higher
      rate of progression of cf-PWV (0.969 m/s; 95% confidence interval = 0.111-1.827; 
      P = 0.03), and this association persisted after further adjustments for
      parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, pharmacological
      dose of alpha-calcidol was associated with accelerated progression of aortic
      stiffness. This study suggest that the vascular safety of active vitamin D
      posology may need to be specifically addressed in the treatment of chronic kidney
      disease-related bone mineral disorder.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk markers associated with arterial calcification in patients
      with chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 167-173
AB  - BACKGROUND: The contribution of pro-inflammatory markers to cardiovascular (CV)
      risk and vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains largely
      to be elucidated. We investigated the association between plasma levels of
      several biomarkers and calcification volume in three different vascular beds in
      CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, exploratory
      study in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >/=20 and
      </=45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and serum phosphorus >/=3.5 and <6.0 mg/dL enrolled in a
      previously published randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled single-centre
      trial. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples were collected at
      baseline before patients received study medication and analysed for the presence 
      of a number of biomarkers. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), thoracic aortic
      calcification (TAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) volumes were
      measured using standard electron-beam computed tomography protocols. Associations
      were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus status,
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure and eGFR.
      RESULTS: Associations with CAC were found for beta2-microglobulin (B2M),
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-18. AAC was
      associated with: B2M, FGF23 and IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2 RA). TAC was associated
      with: B2M, FGF23, IL-2 RA, IL-18 and tumour necrosis factor receptor type I. For 
      most of the analysed biomarkers, there were non-significant trends of
      associations with calcification. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found that
      elevated plasma levels of several inflammatory biomarkers are significantly
      associated with arterial calcification in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. A greater 
      understanding of inflammation and calcification in CKD patients may help the
      development of CV risk-assessment algorithms for better management of these
      patients.

TI  - Correlation of pre-existing radial artery macrocalcifications with late patency
      of primary radiocephalic fistulas in diabetic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 462-70
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.042 [doi]
LID - S0741-5214(14)00309-7 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing
      radial artery macrocalcification (Monckeberg type of arteriosclerosis) on patency
      rates of radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs) in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
      patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this observational prospective
      study, the long-term patency rates (primary outcome measures) of RCFs in ESRD
      diabetics who had Monckeberg radial (+/-brachial) artery disease (calcified [C]
      group) were compared with those obtained in ESRD diabetics who had healthy,
      noncalcified vessels before RCF construction (healthy [H] group). Vessel
      calcification was assessed by plain two-dimensional radiography. For inclusion in
      the C-group, uniform linear railroad track-type macrocalcifications of at least 6
      cm in length, in the medial wall of the radial artery ipsilateral to RCF
      creation, were required. Patients were included in the H-group if the radial
      artery ipsilateral to the RCF creation was free of any macrocalcification, of
      either intima or media type. Any intimal-like plaque with irregular and patchy
      distribution was an exclusion criterion for both groups. Patients in both groups 
      also were required to have suitable upper limb vascular anatomy on the basis of
      ultrasound imaging before RCF creation (cephalic vein of minimum diameter of 1.6 
      mm, without stenosis or thrombosis in all outflow areas, and radial artery of
      minimum diameter of 1.5 mm, without proximal hemodynamically significant
      stenosis). Secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier 
      statistics were used for comparison between groups. RESULTS: The arm radiograph
      at the site of possible fistula construction showed abnormality in 39 patients
      (C-group, 47 RCFs), whereas 33 patients had noncalcified ("healthy") vascular
      anatomy (H-group, 40 RCFs). Mean duration of the diabetic disease at the time of 
      RCF creation was 8.9 +/- 5.6 years (range, 2-25 years) for the H-group and 14 +/-
      9.9 years (range, 1-40 years) for the C-group (P = .018). The mean follow-up
      period for H-group and C-group was 51.9 +/- 35.9 months (range, 0.1-126 months)
      and 26.1 +/- 31.6 months (range, 0.1-144 months), respectively (P = .0006).
      Forty-four patients died during the follow-up period. Primary patency rates at
      12, 24, 36, and 48 months for C-group vs H-group were 50.2% vs 80%, 36.5% vs
      72.3%, 32.4% vs 67.9%, and 29.1% vs 59.3% (P = .0019). Respective values for
      secondary patency rates were 52.4% vs 87.5%, 40.9% vs 82.4%, 36.6% vs 78.1%, and 
      33.2% vs 72.8% (P = .00064). Patient survival rates at 24 and 48 months were
      56.1% and 46.4% for C-group and 92.4% and 67.4% for H-group, respectively (P =
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: ESRD diabetics with radial artery Monckeberg calcifications
      receiving RCFs had worse late clinical outcomes compared with ESRD diabetics with
      healthy distal arm vessels receiving the same access. The long-term benefit of
      RCFs may be lost in diabetics with extensively calcified vessels, and preferably 
      the brachial artery should be used instead.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts
      cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent 
      dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also
      determined whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with
      changes in CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement. 
      METHODS: All patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score,
      lateral abdominal radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left
      ventricular mass index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro
      calibrated to brachial blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard
      BPro SOFT((R)) data into ambulatory CASP. RESULTS: Ambulatory CASP was not
      different in those without and with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, 
      p = 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.2) calcification.
      Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure
      to control for peripheral blood pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished:
      CASP: brachial systolic blood pressure ratio = 0.9 across all categories
      regardless of the presence of coronary or aortic calcification (p = 0.2 and 0.4, 
      respectively). Supporting this finding, left ventricular mass index was also not 
      different in those with or without vascular calcification (p = 0.7 and 0.8 for
      coronary and aortic calcification). Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP
      correlated excellently with ambulatory measurements (r = 0.9 for both).
      CONCLUSION: Vascular calcification was not associated with changes in ambulatory 
      central aortic systolic pressure in this cohort of prevalent dialysis patients.
      Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP correlated very well with ambulatory
      measurement.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous
      pancreas-kidney transplantation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/nep.12212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral
      density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to
      atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of 
      VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD.
      METHODS: Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients
      underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was
      scored using a validated 24-point scale. RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients
      X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their median age was 41 years (16-71), 58%
      were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK 
      transplants. VC scores were >/=1 in 47%, with the median score 6 (1-24) and was
      associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence of cardiovascular,
      cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate analysis of
      patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer dialysis
      vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). In
      that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, 
      presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy,
      and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. CONCLUSION: 
      VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older
      patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. 
      However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse
      association of VC to BMD.
