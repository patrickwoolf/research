abstract = {All patients with End‐Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on dialysis are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (1). In fact, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in its various manifestations (e.g. myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, lower extremity occlusive disease, amputations, etc.) is the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD, accounting for nearly 50% of deaths. (2) After adjusting for age, gender, race, and diagnosis of diabetes, mortality from cardiovascular disease is far higher in patients with ESRD compared to the general population. (3) ESRD and cardiovascular disease have interlocking relationships and to not act as wholly independent processes. A 'synergy' exists whereby CVD can precipitate ESRD by virtue of damage to the blood vessels and kidneys from high blood pressure, circulating inflammatory factors, etc., and conversely, ESRD, arterial calcification, and the effects of its associated treatment, renal replacement therapy, or hemodialysis (HD), can be seen as a harbinger of CVD. This relationship is highly complex, involving both “traditional” and “non‐traditional” CVD risk factors. The 2005 report of the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines stresses these interactions and recommends aggressive CVD screening and treatment for all ESRD patients receiving HD (4). Several recent large‐scale registry studies estimate that up to 60% of new ESRD patients have some manifestation of CVD (5). Likewise, The American Heart Association issued a statement in 2003 that recommended patients with ESRD be considered a “highest risk group” for subsequent cardiovascular disease events (6). Like coronary causes of CVD, non‐coronary causes of cardiovascular disease (e.g. lower extremity occlusive disease, cerebrovascular disease) are thought to be more prevalent in the ESRD population than among the general population, with estimates ranging from 4%‐45% (depending on the definition and population studied) and are responsible for significant morbidity, disability, decrements in quality of life, and death (7). As PAD is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality in the general and dialysis population, early diagnosis of PAD and aggressive medical therapy might improve cardiovascular survival in dialysis patients, but there are currently no randomized, controlled trials of any of the interventions for therapy of PAD in dialysis patients. Data is limited, as most trials of CVD treatments (e.g. lipid lowering medications, etc.) do not include people with chronic kidney disease or ESRD. Comprehensive reviews of the literature (8) indicating medical treatments of CVD (aspirin, statins and beta blockers) are underused in ESRD/HD patients and chronic kidney disease patients.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: There are few reports considering which way should be chosen to administer vitamin D receptor activator (VDRA) to patients on hemodial‐ysis, by intravenous or in oral. We investigated association between each way and prognosis of end‐stage kidney disease patients immediately after initiation of dialysis. Methods: 1520 patients were enrolled in the Aichi Cohort Study of Prognosis in Patients Newly Initiated into Dialysis (AICOPP) study involving 17 centers from October 2011 to September 2013. 967 patients were selected who were ascertained situation of use of VDRA at March 2015. We compared baseline characteristics at initiation of dialysis, survival time from March 2015 between 3 groups: NV group (without VDRA, n=177),OV group (oral VDRA, n=447), and IVgroup (intravenous VDRA, n=343). We used ANOVA and v2 test to analyze difference of continuous and categorized variables, respectively. We used Logrank test to compare Kaplan‐Meier curves. In stratified analyses we compared all‐cause mortality rates with univariate and multivari‐ate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity of diabetes mellitus, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, aortic calcification, eGFR, serum adjusted calcium, serum phosphate, serum magnesium, and use of ACEIs/ARBs. Results: Mean age at baseline was 66.9 years old, Female accounted for 35%, and median follow‐up period was 579 days. Patients in IV group showed low serum corrected calcium, high serum intact PTH and ALP levels at baseline. The figure shows Kaplan‐Meier curves for cumulative survival rates of the three groups. There were 104 deaths during the follow‐up period (NV group, 27 cases; OV group, 53 cases; IV group, 24 cases). Significant differences between the cumulative survival rates were observed for the three groups (p = 0.010). In univariate regression analyses, all‐cause mortality rates were significantly lower in IV group than in NV group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.25‐0.76, p = 0.003). Moreover multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis using the stepwise method showed IV group was associated with low all‐cause mortality as compared with NV group (HR = 0.46,95% CI = 0.24‐0.89, p = 0.022). In addition, high mortality was associated with advanced age, male gender, and higher serum adjusted calcium. [Figure Presented] Conclusions: Early introduction of intravenous VDRA to patients on hemodialysis was suggested to be associated with better prognosis. The novelties of this study are focusing on the effect of early initiation of VDRA and its evidence based on clinical practice. As one of hypotheses, because the subject of our investigation was in relatively early in the course of dialysis, and had not had irreversible hyperparathyroidism yet, patients chosen to IV group who presented lower serum calcium and higher serum intact PTH might have reacted well to intravenous VDRA pulse. On the other hand, the limitations are as follows. First, this is an observational study, and there could remain indeterminate factors regardless of using multivariate analysis. Second, criteria of initiation of dialysis and rules on use of VDRA were undetermined. Prospective randomized control study would be expected.},

abstract = {Osteocalcin (OC) is witamino‐K dependent calcium‐binding protein comprising three gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a strong bond with hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone resorption undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu‐OC) appears in the blood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of Glu‐OC and markers of bone metabolism and their impact on coronary artery calcification in patients with end‐stage renal failure treated with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients (29 women and 39 men) aged 60.3 +/‐ 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/‐ 4.8 months. Control group consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of age and gender. CACS was evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Measurement of carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla‐OC) and Glu‐OC, bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were assessed by ELISA and iPTH by Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the Gla‐OC and Glu‐OC in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the control group 116.37 +/‐ 70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/‐ 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/‐ 3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/‐ 2.63 ng/ ml; p <0.001. Glu‐OC level correlated significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p <0.001) and CaSc (p <0.014). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The results indicate a significant correlation between Glu‐OC and assessed markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has indicated a link between bone metabolism and the degree of calcification in the coronary arteries.},

The ensuing impairment of neutrophil function can contribute to the chronic inflammation state of uremic patients, and the increased risk of bacterial infections or vascular calcifications. The aim of this crossover observational study was to assess the difference in free light chain removal by three different hemodialysis filters in patients not affected by multiple myeloma. METHODS: Free light chain removal was compared in the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane Filtryzer BK‐F, the polyphenylene HFR17 filter and the conventional polysulfone filter F7HPS. Twenty chronic hemodialysis patients were enrolled: mean age was 67.7 ± 17.0 years, M/F = 14/6, dialysis vintage (months) 25.5 ± 32.0. The patients were randomized into two groups of treatment lasting 6 weeks each. The dialysis sessions checked were the midweek sessions and the blood was drawn at times 0, 120' and 240'. Kappa (k) and lambda (λ) light chain levels, β2microglobulin (β2M), C reactive protein (CRP) and albumin were checked. RESULTS: K light chain levels were 345.0 ± 100.0 mg/L, λ light chains were 121.4 ± 27.0 mg/L. The values of k light chains at times 120' and 240' were significantly lower with PMMA and HFR17 than those obtained with F7. The reduction ratio per session (RRs) for k light chains was 44.1 ± 4.3% with HFR17, 55.3 ± 3.4% with PMMA, 25.7 ± 8.3% with F7 (p = 0.018). The RRs for λ light chains was 30.3 ± 2.9% with HFR17, 37.8 ± 17.3% with PMMA, 14.0 ± 3.9% with F7 (p = 0.032). As to β2M, RRs was 42.4 ± 3.2% with HFR17 vs. 33.9 ± 2.8% with PMMA vs. 6.3 ± 1.9% with F7 (p = 0.022). The three filters tested showed no differences in CRP or albumin levels. CONCLUSION: In terms of light chain and β2M removal, the PMMA and on‐line HFR filters are similar and both are significantly more effective than the F7 filter in chronic dialysis patients.

abstract = {Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) represents the bone histologic abnormalities resulting from loss of renal function. It starts early during the loss of kidney function and is seen in virtually all chronic end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis (CKD‐5D). A major component of ROD is bone loss leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated osteoporosis. Debilitating hip fractures occur in patients with CKD at a rate 4.4 times higher than in the general population, with associated high costs, morbidity and an annual mortality of 64%. CKD osteoporosis is distinctly different from post‐menopausal osteoporosis. Presently, no uniformly accepted CKD osteoporosis treatment protocol exists because of challenges related to racially specific bone turnover states. Therefore, most physicians are reluctant to treat this disorder despite the profound impact on health and quality of life, and its association with vascular calcifications. These vascular calcifications confer an increased risk for cardiovascular events which are the major cause of the over 20% annual mortality rate in CKD‐5D patients. The goal of the proposed controlled randomized study is to test the concept that CKD osteoporosis can be successfully treated when treatment is individualized by patients' turnover status. The study will demonstrate that reversal of bone loss can be achieved by increasing bone formation in low turnover patients, and by reducing bone resorption in normal or high turnover patients. A second aim of this study is to provide new information whether these treatments will also retard progression of vascular calcifications. Blood tests measuring FGF23, indicators of Wnt pathway activity, bone resorption and formation will be followed to understand potential mechanisms and to evaluate their usefulness for prediction of changes in bone mass and vascular calcifications. CKD‐5D patients with established osteoporosis will be enrolled into one of two treatment arms based on bone turnover status. Each arm will be adaptively randomized by race, age and gender into treatment or control groups. In the low turnover arm, teriparatide combined with cinacalcet will be given, and in the normal or high turnover arm, alendronate will be administered. Bone mineral density will be measured at baseline and after one year of treatment by quantitative computed tomography. Calcifications of the coronaries, aorta and heart valves will also be measured at the same times by multi‐detector computed tomography. If this proof‐of‐concept study is successful, it will offer a heretofore unavailable treatment for osteoporosis in CKD‐5D patients thus changing the prevailing clinical practice paradigm. This will provide immediate benefit to CKD patients by reducing fracture risk, bone pain, and cardiovascular risk, while greatly improving their quality of life. These improvements will also convey major socioeconomic benefits by decreasing the high associated treatment costs. The proposed study is highly relevant to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' mission of disseminating science‐based information to improve the health and quality of life for patients with endocrine, metabolic and kidney diseases.},

The aim of this cross‐sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma FGF‐23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima‐media thickness (CA‐IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this cross‐sectional study, plasma intact FGF‐23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi‐slice computerized tomography and CA‐IMT assessed by using high‐resolution color Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF‐23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8‐249.5). Median CACs was 98 (IQR 0‐531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA‐IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF‐23 level was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA‐IMT nor the presence of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF‐23 levels. In adjusted ordinal regression analysis, FGF‐23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA‐IMT (model r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in patients with FGF‐23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF‐23 level is superior to phosphate in the prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF‐23 is not associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.},

abstract = {Our EBT study of 205 adult hemodialysis patients revealed a high prevalence of calcification of the coronary arteries, aorta, and cardiac valves. Notably, the degree of coronary calcification was far greater than expected for age‐ and gender‐matched normal individuals in the general population. In addition, the severity of vascular calcification was related to highly prevalent cardiovascular disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that abnormal regulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients. To better understand the mechanisms involved and the link between calcification and cardiovascular disease, prospective trials and observational studies aimed at investigating the effects of modifying the course of calcification will be necessary. Therapeutic interventions such as the use of calcium‐free phosphate binders, ACE inhibitors,2 and statins may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients. Non‐invasive tools such as EBT can be useful to monitor the effectiveness of these measures by following the progression of coronary calcification in patients at risk.},

The aim of the study was to investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Coronary artery calcification score (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima‐media thickness (CA‐IMT) by carotid Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long‐term prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Mean serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 ± 147.5 pg/mL (range 78‐937). sTWEAK level was inversely correlated with CA‐IMT at a borderline significance (r=‐0.168, p=0.05). Neither carotid‐radial PWV nor carotid‐femoral PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. sTWEAK level was higher in patients with severe vascular calcification (CACs ≥400) compared to patients with CACs <400 (264.5 ± 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 ± 122.4 pg/mL, p=0.02).The association between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a weak inverse correlation between sTWEAK and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary artery calcification in long‐term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and low bone turnover with a relatively low parathyroid hormone (PTH) often coexist in diabetic patients undergoing haemodialysis. Since calcium salts (CaS) are used extensively as primary phosphate binders and have been associated with progressive vascular calcification, we studied the effects of CaS on coronary arteries and parathyroid activity in incident haemodialysis diabetic patients. METHODS: We measured the change in coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) with sequential electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 64 diabetic and 45 non‐diabetic patients, randomized to CaS or sevelamer within 90 days of starting haemodialysis. CACS measurements were repeated after 6, 12 and 18 months. Serum intact PTH (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus were serially tested. RESULTS: During the study period, serum phosphate was similar in diabetic and non‐diabetic patients. Serum calcium levels were similar at baseline (2.3+/‐0.25 mmol/l for both) and increased significantly with CaS treatment (P<0.05) both in diabetic and non‐diabetic patients but not with sevelamer. Diabetic patients treated with CaS showed a significantly greater CACS progression than sevelamer‐treated patients (median increase 177 vs 27; P=0.05). During follow‐up, diabetic patients receiving CaS were significantly more likely to develop serum iPTH values<16 pmol/l than diabetic patients treated with sevelamer (33% vs 6%, P=0.005) and had a lower mean iPTH level (24+/‐16 vs 31+/‐14 pmol/l; P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The management of hyperphosphataemia with CaS in haemodialysis diabetic patients is associated with a significantly greater progression of CACS than with sevelamer. These effects are accompanied by iPTH changes suggestive of low bone turnover.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of vitamin K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and vascular calcification. OBJECTIVES We assessed the effect of vitamin K2 substitution on the progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3‐5. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 42 nondialyzed patients with CKD. The following measurements were taken at baseline and after 270 ±12 days of supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose of 90 μg (menaquinone, MK‐7) together with 10 μg of cholecalciferol (K+D group) or 10 μg of cholecalciferol (group D): common carotid intima‐media thickness (CCA‐IMT), coronary artery calcification score (CACS), basic biochemical parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix Gla protein (MGP), desphosphorylated‐uncarboxylated MGP (dp‐ucMGP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), fetuin A, osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23. RESULTS The increase of CCA‐IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D group: from 0.95 ±0.2 mm to 1.01 ±0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 ±0.2 mm to 1.16 ±0.3, P = 0.003 (CCA‐IMT, 0.06 ±0.08 vs 0.136 ±0.05 mm, P = 0.005, respectively). The increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in the D group (ÄCACS, 58.1 ±106.5 AU vs 74.4 ±127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the K+D group, a significant decrease in the level of dp‐ucMGP and total OC was observed. CONCLUSIONS A 270‐day course of vitamin K2 administration in patients with CKD stages 3‐5 may reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, but does not significantly affect the progression of calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly changes the levels of calcification promoters and inhibitors: dp‐ucMGP, OC, and OPG.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is frequently observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Numerous reports show that VC is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality. It has also been known that calcium‐based phosphate binders are more closely associated with the progression of VC than non‐calcium‐based phosphate binders. Lanthanum carbonate (LC) is one of the non‐calcium‐based phosphate binders that decreases serum phosphate levels in patients with CKD. Several studies have reported that LC has less effect on the progression of VC compared to that of calcium‐based phosphate binders in the patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD). Moreover, there are no reports on the effect on VC progression in CKD patients during the early period after the initiation of HD. In this study, we investigated the effect of LC on the progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) compared to that of calcium‐based phosphate binders in these patients. Methods: This was a randomized open‐label study including 108 patients from five centres. These patients were registered with the present study just prior to or within 4 weeks after initiating HD therapy. They were divided into two groups based on the treatment of hyperphosphatemia; the calcium carbonate (CC group) and the LC (LC group). Serum calcium, phosphate, PTH and FGF23 levels and cardiovascular biomarkers were measured prior to initiating HD and 6, 12 and 18 months after initiating HD. We also evaluated CAC by high‐resolution computed tomography and the echocardiographic parameters prior to initiating HD and 12 and 18 months after initiating HD. Results: At baseline, no significant differences were observed in the clinical characteristics between the two groups, apart from sex. However, at 18 months, the serum calcium levels were significantly higher, and the serum PTH levels tended to be lower. Moreover, the serum FGF23 levels tended to be higher in the CC group compared to that in the LC group, although serum phosphate levels were comparable between the two groups. The echocardiographic parameters were similar between the two groups. Although CAC score (CACS) was lower in the LC group compared to that in the CC group, there was no statistical difference. However, among the patients with mild or moderate CAC, the change and percent change in CACS between the baseline and 12 months as well as baseline and 18 months were significantly higher in the CC group compared to those in the LC group (DELTACACS: 243.0 +/‐ 248.0 vs. 128.4 +/‐ 213.2, p < 0.05; % DELTACACS: 366.7 +/‐ 403.0 vs. 153.2 +/‐ 232.6, p < 0.05). In addition, the percent change in CACS between baseline and 18 months was significantly correlated with the serum FGF23 levels at 18 months (r = 0.230, p < 0.05). The significant relationship was stronger, especially among the patients with mild or moderate CAC (r = 0.632, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study suggest that LC prevents the development of CAC in patients with mild or moderate CAC during the early period following the initiation of HD. LC could suppress the elevation of serum FGF23 levels and thereby delay the progression of CAC.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. In CKD, accelerated vascular calcification contributes to arterial stiffness and mortality. A blood test for calcification propensity was recently developed by measuring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles in serum, with a lower T50 corresponding to a higher calcification propensity. The clinical correlates of T50 in KTRs are not known. Methods: We measured T50 in biobanked blood obtained 10 weeks after transplantation during two eras, 2000‐2003 and 2009‐2012. The cross‐sectional clinical correlates of T50 were assessed in a linear regression model with stepwise entry and backward selection of covariates, excluding patients with missing values (1%). Results: Of 1886 eligible adult kidney or kidney‐pancreas recipients during the two eras, 1435 (76%) had T50 measured. Hospital staff shortage excluded 161 patients and 290 were transferred to other hospitals before the investigation in week 10. The cohort was primarily Caucasian with mean age 52 +/‐ 14 years, eGFR 57 +/‐ 19 ml/min/1.73m2, male 66%, diabetes 29.1% including 9.3% post‐transplant diabetes, simultaneous pancreas transplant 6%, rejection 23%, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 39% and T50 196 +/‐ 72 minutes.T50 was lower in the former era (beta ‐26 [95% CI ‐32 to ‐20], p<0.001), diabetes (‐14 [‐21 to 8], p<0.001), recipients of deceased donor kidney (18 [‐24 to ‐11], p<0.001), recipients of a first kidney (‐13 [‐22 to ‐4], p=0.01), after rejection (‐12 [‐21 to ‐3], p=0.01), with higher dosed calcineurin inhibitors (highest quartile trough levels [tac >8.5 or csa >220 ng/mL]; ‐9 [‐16 to ‐2], p=0.02) and higher prednisolone dose (>12.5 mg; ‐34 [‐42 to ‐25], p<0.001), CMV infection (‐8 [‐15 to ‐2], p=0.01) and higher phosphate (per 0.20 mmol/L; 36 [‐39 to ‐33], p<0.001). This model explained 40% of the variance in T50. An association between eGFR and T50 was lost after adjustment for phosphate, suggesting phosphate is an intermediate variable. Other variables not independently associated with T50 included recipient age and gender, known cardiovascular disease, smoking, delayed graft function, thymoglobulin induction, diuretics, ionized calcium and log‐transformed PTH. Conclusions: The clinical correlates of serum calcification propensity T50 included measures of kidney graft quality and function, intensity of immunosuppression, serum phosphate and inflammatory states such as rejection and CMV infection.},

abstract = {Serum fetuin A has been shown to be associated with the risk of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis, and it can predict the onset of cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. The carotid intima‐media thickness (cIMT) is an accessible and reliable method to identify the subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between dialysate calcium concentrations and fetuin A or cIMT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Forty patients, newly diagnosed end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing peritoneal dialysis, were enrolled in the study, with a calcium content of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution of 1.25 mmol/L in 20 patients (low‐Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L in 20 patients (standard‐Ca group). The patients were followed up for 12 months after the PD conducted. Serum fetuin A was determined using a human fetuin A enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kit and cIMT was detected using ultrasonic wave. We observed no difference between two groups with regard to the baseline data of fetuin A, cIMT, calcium, phosphorus, calcium‐phosphorus product, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), or lipid parameters. After 12 months follow‐up, fetuin A (263.92 ± 16.1 vs. 282.76 ± 21.0, p = 0.017) and calcium‐phosphorus product (39.85 ± 7.76 vs. 47.50 ± 6.65, p = 0.009) were obviously lower in the low‐Ca group than standard‐Ca group, the other serum parameters were not different between these two groups. Compared with baseline data, serum fetuin A concentration significantly reduced in low‐Ca group ( p < 0.05). The number of patients with increased cIMT and newly occurring cardiovascular events in the low‐Ca group were significantly reduced than standard‐Ca group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, our data suggest that low calcium dialysate treatment is associated with the decreased serum fetuin A concentration and serum calcium‐phosphorus product, and it is associated with the reduced number of PD patients with increased cIMT or with newly occurring cardiovascular events. However, more studies with lager sample size should be performed in the future.},

Control of hyperphosphataemia is important for the treatment of the vascular calcification. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sevelamer hydrochloride on the progression of aortic calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 42 HD patients were studied in this study and divided into two groups (sevelamer vs. calcium). Sevelamer was added and titrated up to achieve serum P control for 6 months. The estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography scans were performed twice in each patient. We compared the changes in serum calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and lipids in two groups. RESULTS: Serum phosphorus levels decreased significantly from 6.7 +/‐ 0.7 to 6.2 +/‐ 0.5 mg/dl with no changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels in the sevelamer group (p < 0.01), and increased from 6.5 +/‐ 1.0 to 6.7 +/‐ 1.1 mg/dl in the calcium group (p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not change in the sevelamer group and calcium group. The serum levels of total cholesterol decreased significantly from 158.5 +/‐ 20.7 to 146.2 +/‐ 24.1 mg/dl (p = 0.024) and the low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol level from 65.3 +/‐ 14.4 to 54.7 +/‐ 11.6 mg/dl (p = 0.014) in the sevelamer group. Serum C‐reactive protein decreased significantly from 0.14 +/‐ 0.13 to 0.08 +/‐ 0.11 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (p = 0.038) and significantly increased (0.18 +/‐ 0.09 vs. 0.22 +/‐ 0.12 mg/dl) in the calcium group (p = 0.042). The mean changes in ACI (DeltaACI) were 3.6 +/‐ 1.5% in the sevelamer group and 8.2 +/‐ 3.1% in the calcium group. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer allows a better serum phosphorus control compared with calcium‐based phosphate binder and suppresses the progression of aortic calcification in HD patients.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is one of the most important causes of mortality in end‐stage renal disease. Fetuin A, also called as Heramans Schmid alpha 2 glycoprotein (AHSG), is one of the important proteins that inhibit vascular calcification. In this study, we aimed to evaluate relationship between AHSG gene polymorphism and fetuin A levels. Methods: 152 patients receiving regular hemodialysis treatment and 61 healthy controls were included to this cross‐sectional study. The patients in the hemodialysis group were recruited from the patients receiving regular dialysis treatment at least 9 months. Serum fetuin‐A levels were assessed by ELISA method. AHSG Tre256s gene polymorphism is determined by PCR‐RFLP. Results: Serum fetuin A level in hemodialysis patients (330.5+/‐171.2 mg/L) was significantly lower as compared to control group (382.9+/‐138.5 mg/L) (p=0.001). Despite of that significant negative correlation between serum fetuin‐A levels and C‐reactive protein (CRP) (r=‐0.285, p0.05). The distribution of AHSG Thr256Ser gene polymorphism in hemodialysis and control groups were similar (p= 0.111)(figure 1). In the hemodialysis group, serum fetiun A levels in the patients with genotype Thr/Thr (n=94, 366.9+/‐184.2 mg/L) were found to be singnificantly higher than in the patients with genotype Thr/Ser (n=52, 278.1+/‐132.7 mg/L) and Ser/Ser (n=6, 212.5+/‐63.3 mg/L) (respectively; p=0.005, p=0.022). Serum fetuin A levels in the patients with genotype Thr/Ser and Ser/Ser were similar (p=0.211)(figure 2). A stepwise multiple regression model analysis (N=152), correcting for impact of age, gender, serum albumin, CRP, dialysis patients age, revealed independent relationships (total R2 =0.21) between the Thr2556Ser polymorphism( beta:‐0.271, p<0.0001, 95% CI: ‐0.403, ‐0.14), CRP(beta:‐0.013, p<0.0001, 95% CI:‐0.018, ‐0.008), and fetuin A levels (log‐transformed). Conclusions: In this study, hemodialysis patients with Thr/Ser and Ser/Ser genotypes of AHSG gene polymorphism had lower levels of serum fetuin A. An association between inflammation and low serum fetuin A levels in hemodialysis patients was observed. In this patient population, further studies are needed to investigate effects of different races and environmental conditions to AHSG gene polymorphisms and serum fetuin A levels.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is frequent and severe in patients with end‐stage renal disease. Disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute by promoting cardiovascular calcification. METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing sevelamer, a non‐absorbed polymer, with calcium‐based phosphate binders in 200 hemodialysis patients. Study outcomes included the targeted concentrations of serum phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcification of the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta using a calcification score derived from electron beam tomography. RESULTS: Sevelamer and calcium provided equivalent control of serum phosphorus (end‐of‐study values 5.1 +/‐ 1.2 and 5.1 +/‐ 1.4 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.33). Serum calcium concentration was significantly higher in the calcium‐treated group (P = 0.002), and hypercalcemia was more common (16% vs. 5% with sevelamer, P = 0.04). More subjects in the calcium group had end‐of‐study intact PTH below the target of 150 to 300 pg/mL (57% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). At study completion, the median absolute calcium score in the coronary arteries and aorta increased significantly in the calcium treated subjects but not in the sevelamer‐treated subjects (coronary arteries 36.6 vs. 0, P = 0.03 and aorta 75.1 vs. 0, P = 0.01, respectively). The median percent change in coronary artery (25% vs. 6%, P = 0.02) and aortic (28% vs. 5%, P = 0.02) calcium score also was significantly greater with calcium than with sevelamer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with calcium‐based phosphate binders, sevelamer is less likely to cause hypercalcemia, low levels of PTH, and progressive coronary and aortic calcification in hemodialysis patients.},

abstract = {Introduction: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) (>6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what the optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We aimed to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC) dialysate on cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population. Methods: A randomized controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or HC dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change in mineral metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular calcification (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral arteries (SFA)), pulse wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 12 months. Findings: In the LC group, pre‐dialysis ionised calcium decreased ‐0.12 mmol/L (‐0.18‐0.06, P = 0.0001) and PTH increased 16 pmol/L (3.5‐28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no significant change in the HC group. In both groups, there was no progression of VC in AA or SFA and no change in PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics were prescribed in a higher percentage in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) with a lower proportion of the HC group being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs. 72%). Discussion: Although dialysate calcium prescription influenced biochemical parameters it was not associated with difference in progression of VC between HC and LC groups. An important finding was the potential impact of alternate night NHD in attenuating progression of VC and inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Treat‐to‐Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium‐based phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular events, risk equations are needed. METHODS: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron‐beam tomography (EBT)‐based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of calcification, controlling for other characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow‐up 49 months; 32% suffered an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C‐reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000. CONCLUSION: In the absence of long‐term follow‐up studies, these equations permit quantification of the expected long‐term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these equations are key inputs for formal cost‐effectiveness analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Lesion preparation is often essential in patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with end‐stage renal disease on hemodialysis have increased severity of CAC, increasing the complexity of PCI. There here have been no studies that have compared the head‐tohead outcomes of dialysis patients undergoing orbital atherectomy (OA) compared to rotational atherectomy (RA). METHODS This prospective, observational, multicenter study assessed OA vs. RA in dialysis patients with CAC. Thirty‐five thousand five hundred ninety patients from 5 tertiary‐care hospitals who had PCI between January 2011 and April 2016 were identified. Matched analysis of all dialysis patients who had OA or RA prior to PCI was performed (n=62). RESULTS There were 31 patients in each cohort. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint, death on discharge (0% vs. 3.2%, p=0.31). Multivariate adjusted analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences in procedural and in‐hospital outcomes (Table 1). CONCLUSION Atherectomy in patients on dialysis, a complex, highrisk subset of patients, with CAC has not been well‐studied. In this first head‐to‐head analysis of dialysis patients with CAC undergoing atherectomy prior to PCI, there were no significant differences between either modality, with low rates of procedural complications in both groups. Multicenter randomized studies are needed to confirm the optimal atherectomy strategy in this rarely studied patient population. (Figure Presented).},

abstract = {Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients, especially with diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. No randomized studies have been published regarding the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on VC progression in DM patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lanthanum carbonate on the progression of VC in HD patients with type 2 DM. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing LC with calcium carbonate (CC) in 43 HD patients at a single dialysis center. Estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography were performed twice for each patient (at baseline and 12 months). Forty‐one patients completed the study (19 LC, 22 CC). When ACI at baseline was ≦0.48 (median of baseline ACI), median change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 20.44 (11.50‐36.80%) in the LC group, and 40.00 (33.30‐92.60%) in the CC group (P = 0.026). On the other hand, when ACI at baseline was >0.48, the median change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 6.42 (3.13‐24.40%) in the LC group, and 8.08 (5.68‐12.20%) in the CC group (P = 1.000). Serum markers of chronic kidney disease‐mineral and bone disorder (CKD‐MBD), HbA1c, dose of vitamin D analogues, and side‐effects of medications did not change in either group throughout the study except int‐PTH increased in the LC group. This study indicated that administration of LC inhibited the progression of VC in patients receiving HD for type 2 DM, only in cases of slight VC compared with CC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to determine if long‐term use of alendronate can suppress coronary artery and aortic calcification in chronic PD patients. The effect of alendronate on bone mineral density in this patient group is also evaluated. METHODS 1. Patients To be eligible for the study, patients have to meet all of the following criteria: (1) have received maintenance PD for more than 3 months at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, (2) have high CPP level (≧55), and (3) have chest X‐ray proven aortic calcification or coronary artery calcification proven before. Patients are excluded if they have any one of the following conditions: (1) had been hospitalized in recent 3 months due to severe comorbid diseases, (2) are hypersensitive to alendronate or any of its components, (3) have esophageal diseases (4) are not able to stand or sit upright for 30 minutes, (5) have refractory hypocalcemia, or (6) patients who are pregnant. Each eligible participant has to give his/her written informed consent before the start of study. The study should be approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. 2. Study Design The study is a prospective, randomized cross‐over study. Fifty patients will be included. All participants are randomly allocated to either group 1 or group 2. Each group consists of 25 patients. Group 1 patients receive alendronate 70 mg once weekly since the first week till the 16th week of the study, while group 2 patients receive the same dose of drug every week since the 17th week till the 32nd week. Group 1 patients will not receive alendronate since the 17th week till the 32nd week, and group 2 patients will not receive alendronate since the first week till the 16 week. The extent of coronary artery and aortic calcification is evaluated by using multi‐detector spiral computed tomography, whereas bone mineral density is measured by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry. Both examinations are performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant. Serum level of calcium should be kept within normal limits and serum level of phosphorus should be kept below 6 mg/dl. （3）Administration of Alendronate One tablet of alendronate (70 mg per tablet) should be swallowed by each patient once every week with water at least 30 minutes before breakfast, beverage or medication of the day during the treatment period. Patients must not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking the drug. （4）Measurement of Coronary Artery and Aortic Calcification Multi‐detector spiral computerized tomography (CT) of the chest is performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant to measure the extent of coronary and aortic calcification. （5）Measurement of Bone Density Dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry is performed at week 0, 16 and 32 for each participant to measure the density of bone. （6）Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Patients characteristics such as age and sex are documented. Clinical parameters including body height, body weight, duration of dialysis, calcium concentration of dialysate, and medication under use are recorded. Blood pressure is measured at each clinical visit for 3 times after the patient has sit for at least 15 minutes. （7）Collection of Laboratory Data Fasting serum levels of albumin, phosphorus, calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and hemoglobin level of each patient are checked at study entry and once every month. Fasting serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐chol), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐chol), and hypersensitive C‐reactive protein (CRP) of each patient are checked at study entry and once every 3 months. （8）Record of Adverse Effects of Alendronate Any adverse effect of alendronate is recorded every month at clinic visit. （9）Compliance of Patients Compliance of the patients is monitored by using telephone call once every week during the treatment period with alendronate. （10）Statistical Analysis All values are expressed as mean ± SD. All data are tested for normal distribution before analysis. Differences between mean values of the 2 groups are tested by means of analysis of variance. Group comparisons of categorical variables are analyzed using chi‐square test. Multivariate regression is applied to identify independent determinants of coronary artery and aortic calcification. A probability less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in hemodialysis patients. Recent studies showed that elevated osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels are associated with vascular calcification, all cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. This study investigated the effects of vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs, paricalcitol and calcitriol) treatments on serum OPG levels in hemodialysis patients. Methods: Thirty‐two hemodialysis patients (14 women, 18 men) with secondary hyperparathyroidism in whom PTH level was >200 pg/mL, calcium (Ca) level was <9.5 mg/dL, Phosphorus (P) level was <5.5 mg/dL were included the study. Study patients were randomized 1:1 to receive paricalcitol or calcitriol treatments, and both groups included 16 participants. Patients were allowed to adjust phosphate binders. During the study serum PTH, Ca, P levels were measured monthly. Maximum daily dosage of calcium‐containing phosphate binders was 1500 mg. Biochemical and (Table presented) hematological tests and OPG levels were measured at baseline and 3th month of the study. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of demographics and baseline laboratory tests. No difference was found between paricalcitol and calcitriol groups regarding change from baseline and percent change in biochemical markers and OPG levels. When compared to baseline levels significant increase in Ca (p=0.025 vs 0.001) levels and significant decreases in PTH (p=0.001 vs 0.039) and OPG (p=0.001 vs 0.006) levels were noted at 3th month in paricalcitol and calcitriol group, respectively. There was no difference between paricalcitol and calcitriol groups regarding change from baseline levels and percent changes in PTH (‐%44 vs. ‐%32), Ca (%4 vs. %5), P (%0.5 vs. %2), CaxP (%4 vs. % 7) and OPG (‐%16 vs. ‐%15) levels. Conclusions: Decreasing effect of calcitriol and paricalcitol on OPG levels might be associated with lower cardiovascular mortality rates of patients receiving vitamin D receptor activators. No difference was noted between two therapeutic agents regarding their effects on OPG levels. These findings should be confirmed by further large‐scale studies.},

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples were collected at baseline before patients received study medication and analysed for the presence of a number of biomarkers. Coronary artery calcium (CAC), thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) volumes were measured using standard electron‐beam computed tomography protocols. Associations were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, diabetes mellitus status, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), systolic blood pressure and eGFR. // RESULTS: Associations with CAC were found for beta2‐microglobulin (B2M), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) and IL‐18. AAC was associated with: B2M, FGF23 and IL‐2 receptor alpha (IL‐2 RA). TAC was associated with: B2M, FGF23, IL‐2 RA, IL‐18 and tumour necrosis factor receptor type I. For most of the analysed biomarkers, there were non‐significant trends of associations with calcification. // CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study found that elevated plasma levels of several inflammatory biomarkers are significantly associated with arterial calcification in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. A greater understanding of inflammation and calcification in CKD patients may help the development of CV risk‐assessment algorithms for better management of these patients.},

abstract = {Introduction: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop accelerated vascular stiffening, contributing to increased mortality and morbidity. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) provides a useful clinical measure of arterial compliance. Studies have shown that the phosphate binder (PB) sevelamer, when compared to calcium‐based PB (CBPB), may be associated with attenuation of vascular stiffening and calcification. Currently, there is a paucity of data comparing the effects of sevelamer versus CBPB on PWV. We report an interim analysis of pulse wave velocity in a cross over study of phosphate binders. Methods: Prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients were recruited into a prospective, randomised cross‐over study of calcium based phosphate binders vs sevelamer. Participants were followed up at baseline (V1), one week after â€˜washoutâ€™ of all PB (V2), three months after treatment with CBPB (V3) and three months after randomisation and treatment with one of three randomly selected PBs (calcium carbonate (CC), sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) or sevelamer carbonate (SC)). PWV was measured at each study visit, utilising a non‐invasive, impedance cardiography (ICG) monitor (NICCOMO, MEDIS Germany), which calculates pulse wave propagation time from opening of the aortic valve from the ICG trace, to the pulse wave being sensed at the femoral artery measured by oscillometry. PWV tracings were examined for the quality of ICG and PW trace and data was excluded if tracings were suboptimal to exclude spurious readings. Data were analysed using MS Excel. Results: We report on twenty‐one participants have completed all visits. Eight participants were randomised to CC, and to thirteen to sevelamer. Importantly no changes in vitamin D doses were allowed. One participant was excluded from analysis due to cardiac arrhythmia and another due to protocol violation. In those randomised to CBPB there were no significant differences between corrected serum calcium, phosphate or pulse wave velocity measurements at any time point. It was surprising that the phosphate levels at washout did not significantly change at washout in this group. In those randomised to treatment with a sevelamer salt (SC or SH), the mean serum phosphate from V1‐V4 were 1.48Â±0.33, 1.77Â±0.38, 1.44Â±0.41, 1.57Â±0.46 mmol/L respectively. There were statistically significant differences between V1 and V2 (p<0.05), V2 and V3 (p<0.01). Mean corrected calcium was 2.34Â±0.21, 2.25Â±0.21, 2.33Â±0.23, 2.29Â±0.17mmol/L respectively, with a significant difference between V1 and V2 (p=0.01). In this group, mean pre‐HD PWV from V1 to V4 was 8.0Â±0.9, 7.9Â±0.8, 7.4Â±0.8, 7.2Â±1.1m/s, respectively. PWV was significantly reduced at V4 compared with V1 (p=0.003) or V2 (p=0.001) by paired T‐test, suggesting that sevelamer may be able to influence vascular compliance. Conclusions: This study found a statistically significant difference in PWV in the sevelamer treated group after three months of therapy with this phosphate binder. This change appears independent of serum phosphate or calcium levels. The small study size is a major limitation, and a larger study may be warranted to further explore the small change observed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and non‐ESRD patients undergoing 64‐slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic angiography. METHODS: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD patients (n=48), and calcium score‐matched (n=39) and unmatched non‐ESRD controls (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging software. RESULTS: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non‐ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non‐ESRD, P<0.001 for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 vs. 0.804; P=0.574). CONCLUSION: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A sizeable proportion of patients has no or minimal CAC at the inception of dialysis, but it is unclear how long they remain free of it. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, 36 incident hemodialysis patients were submitted to sequential chest computed tomography to quantify CAC at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 30 months. RESULTS: Among them, 15 had absent or minimal CAC score (CACS 0 to 30) and 21 had a CACS>30 at baseline. Overall, the median baseline CACS was 129 (interquartile range [IQR]=0‐709) and it increased to 364 (IQR=8.3‐1683) at study completion (182% increase). Among the 15 patients with minimal CACS, only 3 progressed and the median CACS increase was 20, as opposed to 15 of 21 patients with a baseline CACS>30 whose median progression was 431 (p<0.02). The 18 patients who had CACS progression were older (68.5 vs. 57.3 years, p=0.0081) and exhibited a poorer control of mineral metabolism (phosphorus 5.2 vs. 4.9 mg/ dL, p=0.048; corrected calcium x phosphorus product [CaxP] 49.3 vs. 46.2 mg2/dL2, p=0.001) than the patients without progression. On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of progression were baseline CACS (p=0.038) and time‐averaged Cax;P (p=0.077). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that absent or low CAC at baseline is associated with minimal progression even up to 30 months. Careful management of mineral metabolism appears to be one of the main factors that limit progression of CAC.},

abstract = {While all mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery calcification (CAC) are unknown, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in this process in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ACE2 and CAC in patients on MHD therapy. Ninety patients on MHD therapy were involved in this prospective study. CAC was quantified by CAC score (CACs) using the Agatston method and a multi‐slice CT scanner. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the association between ACE2 and CACs. In the univariate analysis, CACs positively correlated with ACE2 (r=0.666, P<0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, ACE2 levels continued to significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve analysis showed that the serum ACE2 level can predict the extent of CAC. These findings indicate that elevated serum ACE2 may be involved in vascular calcification in patients receiving MHD therapy.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to abnormal bone mineral metabolism. We aim to evaluate the association between peripheral VC (pVC) and bone micro‐architecture using HR‐pQCT in advanced CKD. Methods: We recruited 50 CKD stages 4‐5 (including dialysis) patients and their ageand gender‐matched controls with eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2.We performed HR‐pQCT (XtremeCT, Scanco) at the wrist and ankle to assess bone parameters of distal radius and tibia (82mum resolution, spanning 9.02mm). The same images (Figure 1) were used to quantify pVC mass in mg hydroxyapatite (mgHA) at both sites. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA; Discovery A, Hologic) and AAC‐8 score. Results: Both groups had mean age of 62 years, 78% males and similar BMI. More CKD had measurable pVC than controls (92% vs 30%, p<0.001). In contrast, AAC was only measurable (i.e. AAC score<0) in 49% of CKD and 18% of controls (p= 0.001). Total pVC mass was higher in CKD with median of 3.43 (0‐110.59) mgHA vs 0 (0‐15.66) mgHA in controls (p<0.001). 34% of CKD had diabetes and they had higher median total pVC mass compared to CKD without diabetes (35.51mgHAvs 0.56mgHA, p<0.001). CKD had lower mean volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at both sites compared to controls ( p<0.05). For bone micro‐architecture, CKD had lower mean trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (mean BV/TV 0.13 vs 0.15, p<0.05) and thinner trabeculae (0.065mm vs 0.072mm, p<0.05) compared to controls at distal radius. At distal tibia, CKD also had lower mean cortical area (117.54mm2 vs 140.06mm2, p<0.05) and thinner cortical bone (1.03mm vs 1.25mm, p<0.005). Total pVC mass in CKD had negative correlations with cortical bone micro‐architecture at both sites although stronger correlations were found at distal tibia (Table 1). The degree of correlation at distal radius in CKD was fairly similar to controls. Conclusions: CKD was associated with higher total pVC mass; even more so in CKD with diabetes. Total pVC mass in CKD was strongly associated with less cortical bone at distal tibia. HR‐pQCT allows simultaneous assessment of bone microarchitecture and peripheral vascular calcification which is useful for future CKD mineral bone disorder research. (Figure Presented).},

abstract = {Background: The relationship between oral activated charcoal (OAC) and hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification is not completely clear. We observed and recorded the effects of OAC on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in stage 3–4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: In a randomized controlled study, we included 97 patients with stage 3–4 CKD. In the first phase of the experiment, the patients were randomly divided into the OAC group and placebo group. The endpoint of this phase was the development of hyperphosphatemia. The patients with hyperphosphatemia were selected into the second phase of the study. These patients underwent coronary artery multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and were randomly divided into three groups: the OAC group, the calcium carbonate (CC) group and the lanthanum carbonate (LC) group. Results: The first and second phases of the experiment were followed for 12 months. In the first phase of the experiment, there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with hyperphosphatemia between the OAC and placebo groups (28.57% vs. 79.17%, X2 = 24.958, P = 0.000). In the second phase, the differences in coronary calcification score (CACS) between the OAC group, the CC group and the LC group were statistically significant (525.5 ± 104.2 vs 688.1 ± 183.7 vs 431.4 ± 122.5, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Oral activated charcoal effectively delays the onset of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. OAC appears to delay the development of vascular calcifications in stage 3–4 CKD patients.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of increasing the dialysate calcium concentration (DCa) to 1.75 mmol/L on controlling chronic kidney disease‐mineral and bone disorder in Chinese patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). We reviewed the data of MHD patients in one center (cohort 1) during prior 10 years and analyzed the risk factors of mortality and transference calcification (TC) in120 MHD patients surviving in 2003 (cohort 2). A multicenter, prospective, parallel‐group, controlled trial (cohort 3) was also conducted from January 2011 to December 2012. The DCa at one center was increased from 1.5 to 1.75 mmol/L but was not changed at the other two centers. The clinical outcomes, biochemical parameters, medicine treatments, and TC markers [aortic arch calcification score (AoACS)] were compared between groups. In cohort 1, the annual mean serum iPTH increased significantly over 10 years. In cohort 1, 72 patients survived for 10 years, whose doses of calcium salts and active vitamin D3 and AoACs increased progressively. In cohort 2, the main cause of death was cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) (n = 18, 48.6 %). Male sex and lower serum calcium concentrations were independent risk factors for CCVD mortality. In cohort 3, serum phosphorus, iPTH, and 25(OH)D decreased and serum calcium increased significantly; also, the doses of calcium and vitamin D3 decreased from 2011 to 2012 in the DCa 1.75 group. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes either between groups or between the two calendar years. Our results indicate that increasing DCa to 1.75 mmol/L can decrease the elevated levels of serum iPTH and phosphorus, reduce the doses of calcium and vitamin D3, and be safe for short periods of time. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently determined that in hemodialysis patients, the use of calcium salts to correct hyperphosphatemia led to progressive coronary artery and aortic calcification as determined by sequential electron beam tomography (EBT) while the use of the non‐calcium‐containing binder sevelamer did not. Whether the specific calcium preparation (acetate vs. carbonate) might influence the likelihood of progressive calcification was debated. METHODS: To determine whether treatment with calcium acetate was specifically associated with hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification, we conducted an analysis restricted to 108 hemodialysis patients randomized to calcium acetate or sevelamer and followed for one year. RESULTS: The reduction in serum phosphorus was roughly equivalent with both agents (calcium acetate ‐2.5 +/‐ 1.8 mg/dl vs. sevelamer ‐2.8 +/‐ 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.53). Subjects given calcium acetate were more likely to develop hypercalcemia (defined as an albumin‐corrected serum calcium > or =10.5 mg/dl) (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.015). Treatment with calcium acetate (mean 4.6 +/‐ 2.1 g/day ‐ equivalent to 1.2 +/‐ 0.5 g of elemental calcium) led to a significant increase in EBT‐determined calcification of the coronary arteries (mean change 182 +/‐ 350, median change +20, p = 0.002) and aorta (mean change 181 +/‐ 855, median change +73, p < 0.0001). These changes were similar in magnitude to those seen with calcium carbonate. There were no significant changes in calcification among sevelamer‐treated subjects. CONCLUSION: Despite purported differences in safety and efficacy relative to calcium carbonate, calcium acetate led to hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients. Matrix GLA protein (MGP) is one of the most potent inhibitors of VC and its activation is vitamin K dependent. Patients on Hemodialysis (HD) have high levels of uncarboxylated‐MGP, an inactive form of MGP and increasing evidence suggest that they may benefit from vitamin K2 supplementation. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of oral administered vitamin K2 on serum levels of uncarboxylated‐MGP (ucMGP). Methods: This was a single cohort, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in hemodialysis patients. Patients with a history of impaired mental function, low life expectancy and chronic gastrointestinal disorders were excluded. All patients were randomly assigned in two main groups (vitamin K2 200 lg/day and controls). Blood samples were taken from both groups at the initiation of the study and after 3 months. The ucMGP concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Haemoglobin, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, ferritin and parathyroid hormone were measured using standard laboratory techniques. Ethics Committee approved trial protocol, while all patients who participated in the study signed an informed consent. Results: Overall 102 patients (46 males, age 68,3614,6 years) were included in the study. Atbaseline, among the two study groups, no statistically significant differences were identifiedin demographics, comorbidities and uc‐MGP values. At 3 months, in the vitamin K2 patient group, uc‐MGP levels decreased at a rate of 26% but these results were not statistically significant (6,89 61,56vs 5,11 60,79 lg/ml, p>0,05). In the control group, uc‐MGP levels remained unchanged (6,56 62,58 Vs 6,56 61,5 lg/ml, p=ns). Among other studied parameters, baseline uc‐MGP levels were correlated with HDL and phosphorus levels (r=0,291, p=0,023 and r=‐0,270, p=0,034, respectively). Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients tend to have increased uc‐MGP levels, probably because of the well established vitamin K deficit. Oral administered vitamin K2 causes a significant decrease in uc‐MGP levels. This effect may be beneficial in terms of prevention of vascular calcification.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Aim of the study ‐ to evaluate relation between vascular calcification (VC) assesed by simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) and outcomes in chronic hemodialysis patients. Objectives: 1. To evaluate prevalence of VC in hemodialysis patients using SVCS based on plain radiography; 2. To analyse possible relationship among Ca‐P metabolism disorders, VC and risk of death in hemodialysis patients; 3. To assess VC impact on survival of hemodialysis patients. Methods: The SVCS was evaluated in all prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients (n=95) in Hospital of Lithuania University of Health Sciences starting February 2013. The analysis of plain radiographic films of pelvis and hands was performed by single radiologist blinded to clinical data as it is described by Adragao et al. (Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2004) 19;1480‐88) with SVCS >3 considered as cut off value. For the analysis patients were divided into two groups: group 1‐ SVCS <3, group 2‐ SVCS >3. Age, HD vintage, clinical and demographical data as well as biochemical parameters (Ca, ionized Ca, P, PTH, AP, total cholesterol, albumin, hemoglobin) were collected on the day of VC assesment from medical records of each patient. Variables were expressed as frequencies for discrete factors and mean values for continues factors. Comparison was performed using two tailed chi‐square test for categorical variables and Students t‐ test for continuous variables, with p value <0,05 considered as statistical significant. The independent variables associated with death were tested with Cox regression models, using age, sex, hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, Ca, P, PTH, Ca‐P product, cholesterol and vascular scores as covariates. Kaplan ‐Meier survival curves of patients with SVCS >3 and <3 were compared by long‐ rank test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS packages. Results: Data of 54 (56,8%) male and 41 (43,2%) female patients were analysed. 19 patients (20%) were diabetic. Mean age was 61,01+/‐15,7 year, hemodialysis vintage‐39,7 +/‐46,2 months. During the observational period of 23 month there were 11 (11,6%) all‐cause deaths. SVCS <3 was detected for 38 (40%) patients and SVCS >3 ‐ 57 (60%) patients. No statistical significant differences were observed in sex distribution, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension frequency comparing patients between the groups. The hemodialysis vintage did not differ significantly, but group 2 patients were significantly older (1 group‐54,37+/‐15,6, 2 group‐65,44+/‐14,39, p=0,001) and had diabetes more often (1 group‐3 (7,9%) 2 group‐16 (28,1%), p=0,016). Biochemical parameters did not differ significantly between the groups. Cox regresion analysis revealed no statistical significant diference of relative risk of death with regards to HD vintage, age, sex, diabetes mellitus, Ca, P, PTH, Ca‐P product, cholesterol. Only higher SVCS was associated with 1,3 times higher relative risk of death (95% CI 1,032‐1,681, p=0,027). Kaplan‐Meier analysis revealed that the cumulative hazard of death at 23 months was higher in patients of group 2 (2,7% vs 17,5%, long‐rank‐4,6, p=0,032). Conclusions: 1. More than half of prevalent hemodialysis patients had signifficant VC detected by plain radiography. 2.

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular disease isthe leading cause ofdeath in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the "chronic‐kidney‐disease‐mineral and bone disorder‐CKD‐MBD" syndrome is a major contributor to it. The T50 Calcification Inhibition Test (T50‐Test) is a global functional test analyzing the overall propensity for vascular calcification and represents a new but validated method to estimate the burden of CKD‐MBD. Chronic metabolic acidosis might accelerate cardiovascular diseases in CKD patients and low serum bicarbonate (HCO3‐) is associated with a high calcification propensity (short T50 time). The aim of the current study was to estimate the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation on serum calcification propensity in patients with CKD and chronic metabolic acidosis. Methods: The analysis included patients with CKD‐G3/4 from the SoBic‐study, an ongoing randomized‐controlled trial. Patients with a serum HCO3‐ 21mmol/L were either randomized to the treatment (target HCO3‐ 2461 mmol/L orthe rescue group (target HCO3‐ 2061 mmol/L). We measured T50 time and covariates at baseline and 4weeks. We estimated the effectof changeofserum HCO3‐ on changeof T50 time by means of a linear regression model, adjusted for eGFR change, serum phosphate change, and age. Results: Thirty‐five patients were included in the final analysis. Patient characteristics are given in table 1. Serum HCO3‐ increased by 2.8 (61.9) mmol/L in the treatment group and by 1.7 (62.2) mmol/L in the rescue group (p=0.10). T50 time increased by 4 (669) mininthe treatment group andby 18(656) minin the rescue group (p=0.53), resulting in an overall mean difference of 10 min (95%CI:‐11, 32). Baseline eGFR was higher in the rescue group compared to the treatment group (27.45 vs. 23.64 mL/min per 1.73 m2, p=0.19), but eGFR change between visits was not statistically different between groups (1.31 vs.‐0.70 mL/min per 1.73 m2, p=0.31). Other covariates were not statistically different between visits and groups. The regression (figure 1) showed that by 1mmol/L change ofHCO3‐ the T50 time changed by2 min (95%CI:‐6, 10). Noteworthy,1 mmol/L changein serum phosphate resultedina‐144 min (95%CI:‐237,‐52) change of the T50 time and a 1‐year increase of age leads to a decrease of‐1 min (95%CI:‐3,‐0.3) of the T50 time. Conclusions:In patients with CKD and chronic metabolic acidosis an increaseof serum HCO3‐ evenby high doses oforal sodium HCO3‐ supplementation did not change the serum calcification propensity. Noteworthy, change of serum phosphate was a strong negative predictor of the T50 time.},

abstract = {The effects of statin treatment on coronary artery calcifications, carotid artery intima‐media thickness, and endothelial functions have never been investigated in hemodialysis patients. Regarding inflammation, the present data in hemodialysis patients are derived from small studies with short follow‐up. We postulate that atorvastatin would reduce progression of coronary calcification and carotid artery intima‐media thickness, decrease inflammation, and improve endothelial function. In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, four hundred forty‐six prevalent hemodialysis patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to atorvastatin (20 mg/day in first month; increased to 40 mg/day afterwards) and placebo arms (each arm consists of 223 patients), after completion of baseline investigations. Randomization will be performed with random permuted blocks and will be stratified according to dialysis center, age, sex, diabetic status, duration of dialysis, high flux dialyser use, and dialysate calcium level. Follow‐up period will be twelve months. It is estimated that 446 patients would provide 90% power with a two‐sided, alpha error rate of 5%, of detecting a significant difference between treatment arms. Dropout rate is expected to be 20%, not to be replaced.},

abstract = {Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)‐dependent patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty‐two HD‐dependent patients who underwent pre‐intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Pre‐intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non‐culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area stenosis were similar between groups. The HD‐dependent group had greater mean calcium arcs in culprit (54.3degree vs 26.4degree, p = 0.004) and non‐culprit lesions (34.3degree vs 24.5degree, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments (101.6degree vs 0degree, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium >30degree within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD‐dependent group (41.9% vs 4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the HD‐dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial calcification or thin‐cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, HD‐dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of non‐atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with long‐term outcomes in patients with CKD.

METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was performed in 55 PD patients who underwent pelvic X‐ray to assess for VC. Patients with and without linear calcifications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (27.3%) had linear calcifications on pelvic X‐ray. FGF‐23 levels were higher in patients with VC (299.5 (30.4‐2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8‐1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic patients had lower FGF‐23 values (43.2 (14.9‐134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8‐2,410) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Patients with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF‐23 levels (70.6 (14.8‐513) vs. 179.5 (30.4‐2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not reach statistical significance. FGF‐23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis duration and HbA1c were positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and ALP were negatively associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF‐23 levels, age, dialysis duration and RRF to be associated with VC. CONCLUSIONS: FGF‐23 levels are associated with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed to clarify whether it is simply a marker or a potential factor. It may prove to be an important therapeutic target for VC management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high incidences of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic kidney disease‐mineral bone disorder (CKD‐MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT. METHODS: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were randomized to cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the achievement of >30% reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated to further explore the effect of cinacalcet on CKD‐MBD parameters for 24‐week follow up and 12 additional weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation. RESULTS: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, p = .001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF‐23, tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24‐week follow up and markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF‐23, and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can provide salutary effects on CKD‐MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially effective PTH‐lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions (standard vs biocompatible) on long‐term patients' and the techique survival. METHODS: A total of 42 stable patients on CAPD participated in this cross‐sectional study. They were prospectively followed‐up during the twelve years. Patients with severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/L) and malignant disease ware excluded. Twenty one (50%/0) patients were treated with the standard PD solutions (CAPDP‐1) while the other 21 (500/0) were treated with biocompatible PD solutions [(lower level of glucose degradation products, lower concentration of Ca(2+) and neutral pH (CAPDP‐2)]. All patients were analyzed for a presence of vascular calcification, nutrition status, and parameters of inflammation after 2.5 +/‐ 0.6 years of starting CAPD, and these variables considered in the analysis as risk factors. RESULTS: The patients from the group CAPDP‐2 compared to those from the group CAPDP‐1 had lower level of high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) (p = 0.003), and better nutritional status as confirmed by the mid‐arm circumference (p = 0.015), and mid‐arm muscle circumference (p = 0.002) and subjective global assessment (p = 0.000). Also, they had lower vascular calcifications as confirmed by intima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.003), degree of carotid narrowing (p = 0.001) and calcified plaques of common carotid arteries (CCA) (p = 0.008). Kaplan‐Meier analysis confirmed better survival of patients from the group CAPDP‐2 than those from the group CAPDP‐1 (1‐, 5‐, and 10‐year patients survival rate was: 100%, 61.9% and 14.3% for the group CAPDP‐1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 52.4% for the group CAPDP‐2, respectively; p = 0.0345). The 1‐, 5‐, and 10‐year technique survival rate was: 100%, 71.4%, and 38.1% for the group CAPDP‐1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 76.2% for the group CAPDP‐2, respectively; (p = 0.0719). Duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride and cardiovascular score (quantitative scoring system consisting of: ejection fraction (EF) of left ventricle < 50%; IMT > 1 mm; carotid narrowing degree > 50%, presence of carotid plaques in both common carotide, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease with or without amputation) were independent predictors of overall patient survival. Duration of dialysis was only independent predictor of overall technique survival. CONCLUSION: Although patients treated with biocompatible solutions showed significantly better survival, the role of biocompatibility of CAPD solutions in patients and technique survival have to be confirmed. Namely, multivariate analysis confirmed that duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride and cardiovascular score significantly predicted overall CAPD patients survival, while only duration of dialysis was found to be independent predictor of overall techique survival.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study analyzed the outcomes of patients who presented with non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy for severe coronary artery calcification (CAC). Background: Patients who present with NSTEMI have increased risk for death and recurrent MI after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with severe CAC have worse outcomes after PCI.Orbital atherectomy modifies calcified plaque, facilitating stent delivery and optimizing stent expansion. There are no data on these patients who present with NSTEMI who undergo orbital atherectomy. Methods: Of the 454 consecutive real‐world patients who underwent orbital atherectomy in our retrospective multicenter registry, 51 patients (11.2%) presented with NSTEMI. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30. days. Results: Patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, lower mean ejection fraction, and required more vessels to be treated. The primary endpoint was similar in patients who presented with and without NSTEMI (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.9), as were the 30‐day rates of death (2.0% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.67), MI (0% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.42), target vessel revascularization (0% vs. 0%, p >. 0.91), and stroke (0% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.72). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis rate were low in both groups. Conclusions: Despite having worse baseline characteristics, patients who presented with NSTEMI and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy had similar clinical outcomes compared with patients without NSTEMI.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with future cardiovascular events and/or death of patients on hemodialysis (HD). We investigated whether progression of CAC in patients on HD could be delayed by switching from a calcium (Ca)‐based phosphate (Pi) binder to lanthanum carbonate. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: The CAC scores were evaluated at study enrollment and after 6 months in 52 patients on HD using calcium carbonate (CC) as a Pi binder. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups assigned to receive either CC or lanthanum carbonate (LC), and the CAC scores were evaluated after a 6‐month treatment period. Progression of CAC was assessed, as were serum levels of Ca, Pi, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). RESULTS: Forty‐two patients completed the study (23 receiving CC and 19 receiving LC). In the 6 months prior to randomization, all patients were treated with CC. During this 6‐month period, the CAC scores increased significantly in all 42 patients. Once randomized, there was significantly less progression in the group treated with LC than with CC. Changes in CAC scores from 6 to 12 months were significantly smaller in the LC group than the CC group (‐288.9 ± 1176.4 vs 107.1 ± 559.6, P = .036), and percentage changes were also significantly different (‐6.4% vs 41.2%, P = .024). Serum Ca, Pi, and iPTH levels were similar in both groups during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggested that LC delayed progression of CAC in patients on HD compared with CC.},

abstract = {Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a pathologic process specific of atherosclerosis and able to predict cardiovascular events. Hyperphosphatemia (hyperP) has been associated with CAC in kidney disease, but the relation in normal phosphate (P) setting is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the association between P and CAC in a population‐based setting, assessing evidence of causality through Mendelian Randomization (MR). Methods: Serum P and CT‐CAC were assessed in Rotterdam Study I. Phenotypic associations through generalized models were adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, 25OHD, CRP, glucose and cholesterol:HDL ratio. MR was implemented through an allele score including eight P single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by the GWAS catalogue. MR assumptions were assessed through SNP strength; regression with potential confounders and testing or allowance of pleiotropic effects. Methods included two‐stage least square, adaptive lasso and variational Bayes. Results: In phenotypic analyses, serum P was related to CAC with sex interaction (p interaction = 0.005) [men b: 0.93 (0.62‐1.23), p = 6x10‐9, n = 816; women b: 0.41(0.09‐0.74), p = 0.013, n = 940]; exclusion of hyperP and chronic kidney disease (CKD: eGFR=60 mL/min) yielded [men b: 0.90(0.54‐1.26), p = 2x10‐6, n = 711; women b: 0.43 (0.04‐0.82), p = 0.032, n = 790]. In MR analyses, instrumented P through the unweighted allele score was related to CAC (sex‐combined b: 1.83(0.06‐3.60), p = 0.043, n = 1693)‐also after exclusion of hyperP and CKD (sex‐combined b: 2.79(0.69‐4.89), p = 0.009, n = 1446). No evidence of invalid instruments was found. Allowance for pleiotropy yielded [sex‐combined b: 1.91 (Cr I 0.47‐3.80)]. Conclusions: P is related to CAC in the general population with a stronger effect in men. MR findings support causality; also for P and CAC in subjects without hyperP and CKD. Further research into mechanisms and sex differences is needed. Our findings might have an impact in public health. [Table Presented].},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the coronary Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) to prepare severely calcified lesions for stent deployment in patients grouped by renal function. BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of severely calcified lesions is associated with increased rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared with PCI of non‐calcified vessels. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for MACE after PCI. The impact of CKD on coronary orbital atherectomy treatment has not been well characterized. METHODS: ORBIT II was a prospective, multicenter trial in the U.S., which enrolled 443 patients with severely calcified coronary lesions. The MACE rate was defined as a composite of cardiac death, MI, and target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Of the 441 patients enrolled with known estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at baseline, 333 (75.5%) patients had eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 108 patients had eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 . The mean eGFR at baseline in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 groups was 65.0 ± 0.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 109.1 ± 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively. Freedom from MACE was lower in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 group at 30 days (87.4% vs. 96.3%, P = 0.02) and 1‐year (80.6% vs. 90.7%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with renal impairment had a higher MACE rate through one year follow‐up due to a higher rate of periprocedural MI. Interestingly, the rates of cardiac death and revascularization through 1‐year were similar in patients with eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Future studies are needed to identify the ideal revascularization strategy for patients with renal impairment and severely calcified coronary lesions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Cardiac abnormalities such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and systolic and diastolic dysfunction are frequently observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and these are associated with cardiovascular disease events and mortality. Although there are many studies to assess the effect of phosphate binders on the progression of vascular calcification, few studies investigated its effect on cardiac abnormalities. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on cardiac abnormalities compared to that of calcium carbonate (CC) in patients new to hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a randomized open‐label study and patients registered in the present study were divided into two groups based on the treatment of hyperphosphatemia; the LC group and the CC group. Echocardiography was performed prior to initiating HD and 12 and 18 months after initiating hemodialysis. Serum calcium, phosphate, PTH and FGF23 levels and cardiovascular biomarkers were also measured prior to initiating HD and 6, 12 and 18 months after initiating hemodialysis. RESULTS: At the end of study, serum calcium levels were significantly lower in the LC group compared to the CC group. However, serum phosphate and intact parathyroid hormone levels were comparable between the two groups. Serum FGF23 levels were significantly lower in the LC group than in the CC group at 6 months, and the levels tended to be lower in the LC group even at 12 and 18 months although there were no statistically significant differences. At baseline, no significant differences were observed in the clinical characteristics between the two groups, apart from sex. Echocardiographic parameters were also similar between the two groups at baseline. However, at 18 months, left atrial diameter (LAD), left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd), left ventricular systolic diameter (LVDs), fractional shortening (FS), and ejection fraction (EF) were significantly improved in the LC group compared to the CC group. At 18 months, log‐serum FGF23 levels were significantly correlated with LVDd, LVDs, and ejection fraction (EF), and tended to be correlated with LAD. In the present study, log‐serum FGF23 levels had no significant relationship with left ventricular mass index (LVMI). To assess the relationship between serum FGF23 levels and echocardiographic parameters, we performed multivariate regression analysis. The result showed that log‐serum FGF23 levels were significantly correlated with EF. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that LC can ameliorate cardiac abnormalities in patients with CKD during the early period following the initiation of hemodialysis.},

abstract = {Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD‐5D) and is an important predictor of mortality. However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not been well established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases mortality by adversely affecting cardiac function. Methods: Patients were recruited from 37 regional dialysis centers. 2‐D and Doppler echocardiographic analyses were performed, and CAC was measured using 64‐slice computed tomography. Relationships between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function were analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow‐up of 37 months. Results: There were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median age was 55 years, and median duration of CKD‐5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC scores > 100 were found in 69% of patients, with 51% having a score > 400. CAC was associated with measures of LV systolic and diastolic function (global longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity (rho = ‐0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV filling pressure (E:E'; rho = 0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed these relationships after adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and coronary artery disease. Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). Both LV diastolic and systolic functional measures were significant predictors of mortality, the strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. Conclusions: These findings show a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD‐5D. LV diastolic function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent predictors of mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in CKD‐5D. These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with CKD‐5D and describe a potentially‐valuable role for echocardiography in the routine management of these patients.

abstract = {The optimal surgical procedure for severe renal secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is still a point of controversy. Total parathyroidectomy (PTX) without auto‐transplantation was abandoned for fear of an adynamic bone condition; however, in the case of autotransplantation recurrent sHPT is frequent and promotes atherosclerosis. We studied 11 hemodialysis patients (age 59+/‐12 years) on dialysis for 18 (12‐30) years in whom total PTX was performed due to severe sHPT (group I; intact PTH: 1,240+/‐230 pg/ml), and 5 patients (age 55+/‐10 years) without renal insufficiency who inadvertently received total PTX during thyroid surgery (group II). After total PTX (group I, 26+/‐18 [9‐59] months; group II, 252+/‐188 [22 480] months) both groups showed no measurable intact PTH levels. Calcium homeostasis was maintained by oral substitution with calcium (group I, calcium dialysate of 2.0 mmol/l), vitamin D and calcitriol (serum parameters in groups I and II: calcium 2.4 and 2.2 mmol/l; phosphate 1.8 and 1.1 mmol/l; 25(OH)‐vitamin D(3) 21 and 34 ng/ml; 1,25(OH)(2)‐vitamin D(3) 32 and 41 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, after total PTX there was a rapid and sustained improvement in bone pain with markedly enhanced physical activity and endurance. High turnover osteopathy markedly improved as indicated by declining levels of native osteocalcin (90+/‐17 vs. 26+/‐18 ng/ml), bone alkaline phosphatase (74+/‐12 vs. 12+/‐6 ng/ml), and carboxyterminal cross‐linked telopeptide of type‐I collagen (65+/‐16 vs. 40+/‐21 ng/ml) but increasing levels of carboxyterminal propeptide of type‐I procollagen (120+/‐36 vs. 148+/‐41 ng/ml). Recalcification of bone was excellent as demonstrated by X‐ray and confirmed by bone histology. Itching extravascular calcific deposits and calcifications of blood vessel and cardiac valves immediately stopped after total PTX. Moreover, 6 sHPT patients suffered from severe atherosclerotic lesions such as thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 3) or abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 3) which showed size progression before but not after total PTX when annually controlled by ultrasonography. In group II, even long after total PTX, there was no clinical, radiological, histological or biochemical evidence for low turnover osteopathy. In conclusion, our data indicate that substitution with vitamin D(3) metabolites and calcium can prevent deleterious bone effects of hypoparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and in patients with normal kidney function and may compensate for the missing PTH action. Over this, a better survival rate is expected as a consequence of the beneficial effect of total PTX on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. We suggest reconsideration of total PTX without autotransplantation in dialysis patients with severe sHPT who are not eligible for renal transplantation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) (≥6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what the optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We aimed to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC) dialysate on cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or HC dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change in mineral metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular calcification (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral arteries (SFA)), pulse wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 12 months. FINDINGS: In the LC group, pre‐dialysis ionised calcium decreased ‐0.12 mmol/L (‐0.18‐0.06, P = 0.0001) and PTH increased 16 pmol/L (3.5‐28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no significant change in the HC group. In both groups, there was no progression of VC in AA or SFA and no change in PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics were prescribed in a higher percentage in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) with a lower proportion of the HC group being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs. 72%). DISCUSSION: Although dialysate calcium prescription influenced biochemical parameters it was not associated with difference in progression of VC between HC and LC groups. An important finding was the potential impact of alternate night NHD in attenuating progression of VC and inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. In CKD, accelerated calcification contributes to arterial stiffness and mortality. A blood test for calcification propensity was recently developed by measuring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles in serum, with a lower T50 corresponding to a higher calcification propensity. The prognostic implication of T50 in kidney transplant recipients is not known. Methods: We measured T50 in biobanked blood obtained 10 weeks after transplantation during two eras, 2000‐2003 and 2009‐2012. Survival was assessed in Cox regression models, adjusting for age, gender and clinical correlates of T50 including era, diabetes including post‐transplant diabetes, first kidney recipient, deceased donor kidney, rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, eGFR, phosphate, prednisolone dose >12.5 mg and highest quartile of calcineurin inhibitor trough levels (TAC >8.5 or CsA >220 ng/mL). Although T50 was lower during the first era, there was no interaction between era and T50 regarding survival and the cohorts were combined in the survival analyses. Patients with missing values (1%) were excluded fromthe multivariablemodel. Due to non‐linearity, T50 was modeled as quartiles with median levels at 111, 165, 216 and 287 minutes, respectively. Results: Of 1886 eligible adult kidney or kidney‐pancreas recipients during the two eras, 1435 (76%) had T50 measured. Hospital staff shortage excluded 161 patients and 290 were transferred to other hospitals before the investigation in week 10. The cohort was primarily Caucasian with mean age 52 +/‐ 14 years, eGFR 57 +/‐ 19 ml/min/ 1.73m2, male 66%, diabetes 29.1% including 9.3% post‐transplant diabetes, simultaneous pancreas transplant 6% and T50 196 +/‐ 72 minutes. Median (25th, 75th percentile) follow‐up was 5.1 (3.5, 11.6) years. All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality occurred in 283 and 104 patients, respectively. As shown in the table, lower quartiles of T50 were strongly associated with both endpoints. Conclusions: Serum calcification propensity T50 is strongly associated with all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality in kidney transplant recipients. (Table Presented).},

After baseline evaluation, one group (EffCaMgCit Group) will take EffCaMgCit, and the other group (CaAcS Group) will take calcium acetate suspension/solution for two years. Both drugs will be taken 1 sachet each just before or along with breakfast and dinner for the first three months. If tolerated, the dose will be increased to 1 sachet tid just before or along with breakfast, lunch and dinner. After screening and a baseline evaluation, research personnel will visit patients at the dialysis center every three months for two years. Patients will be evaluated with a medical history, side effect questionnaires, blood pressure measurements, blood tests, echocardiograms, coronary artery calcification analyses, muscle magnesium analyses, and bone mineral density analyses. It is expected that markers of cardiovascular risk would be improved in patients taking CaMgCit, and would remain stable in those taking CaAcS. Endpoint Expectations: ‐ During treatment with EffCaMgCit, T50 would increase (indicative of reduced propensity for CPP formation) ‐ Serum Mg (inhibitor of CPP formation) would be increased by EffCaMgCit ‐ An increase in intracellular muscle Mg would show that EffCaMgCit provides a Mg load, and also indicates repletion of Mg stores that might be cardioprotective independently of effects on CPP formation ‐ The Investigators anticipate that serum FGF23 would be lower and serum Klotho would be higher on EffCaMgCit},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcium carbonate used as a phosphate binder may contribute to cardiovascular calcification. Long‐term comparisons of sevelamer, a non‐calcium polymeric phosphate binder, and calcium carbonate (CC) are lacking. METHODS: 114 adult hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to open label sevelamer or CC for 52 weeks. Study efficacy endpoints included changes in serum phosphorus, calcium, calcium‐phosphorus product, and lipids. In addition, initial and sequential electron beam computerized tomography scans were performed to assess cardiovascular calcification status and change during follow‐up. Safety endpoints were serum biochemistry, blood cell counts and adverse events. RESULTS: Patients receiving sevelamer had a similar reduction in serum phosphorus as patients receiving CC (sevelamer ‐0.58 +/‐ 0.68 mmol/l, CC ‐0.52 +/‐ 0.50 mmol/l; p = 0.62). Reductions in calcium‐phosphorus product were not significantly different (sevelamer ‐1.4 +/‐ 1.7 mmol2/l2, CC ‐0.9 +/‐ 1.2 mmol2/l2; p = 0.12). CC produced significantly more hypercalcemia (> 2.8 mmol/l in 0% sevelamer and 19% CC patients, p < 0.01) and suppressed intact parathyroid hormone below 150 pg/ml in the majority of patients. Sevelamer patients experienced significant (p < 0.01) reductions in total (‐1.2 +/‐ 0.9 mmol/l, ‐24%) and LDL cholesterol (‐1.2 +/‐ 0.9 mmol/l, ‐30%). CC patients had significant increases in coronary artery (median +34%, p < 0.01) and aortic calcification (median +32%, p < 0.01) that were not observed in sevelamer‐treated patients. Patients on sevelamer required more grams of binder (sevelamer 5.9 g vs. CC 3.9 g) and experienced more dyspepsia than patients on calcium carbonate. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer is an effective phosphate binder that unlike calcium carbonate is not associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The existence of adynamic bone disease (ABD) as most prevalent form of renal osteodystrophy in recent years and its reduced ability to handle an exogenous calcium load has implied a higher risk for vascular and soft‐tissue calcifications. The effect of low dialysate calcium (LCD) on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in ABD patients has not yet sufficiently been clarified. This randomized, prospective study aimed to compare the effects of LCD and high calcium dialysate (HCD) on the evolution of bone and mineral parameters related to ABD in dialysis patients. METHODS: 52 out of 60 patients with predialysis intact PTH<100 pg/ml completed this study and were equally distributed over LCD (1.25 mmol/l) or HCD (1.75 mmol/l) treatment. The duration of the study was 6 months and the only peroral phosphate binder administered was calcium carbonate. Total and ionised calcium were measured monthly in serum before and after dialysis while serum parameters relevant to bone were measured at the enrollment and at 3‐month intervals. RESULTS: There were no differences in predialysis mean phosphate or calcium x phosphorus product (Ca x P). The most common side effects of both treatments were comparable. Hypotension occurred in 16% and 17% and cramps in 6% and 8% of the dialysis sessions, in the HCD and LCD group, respectively. The groups did not differ in the mean tCa before dialysis, but this parameter was significantly higher in the HCD group vs. LCD at the end of dialysis (2.59+/‐0.18 vs. 2.44+/‐0.19 mmol/l; p<0.01). The patients of the HCD group also had a significantly higher mean iCa both before (1.08+/‐0.05 vs. 1.04+/‐0.06 mmol/l; p=0.02) and at the end of dialysis (1.18+/‐0.04 vs. 1.48+/‐0.04 mmol/l; p<0.01). There were no differences within the LCD group between baseline and end of dialysis treatment values of tCa and iCa. However, the mean tCa and iCa were markedly increased at the end of dialysis in the HDC group [2.40+/‐0.21 vs. 2.59+/‐0.18 mmol/l (p<0.01); 1.08+/‐0.05 vs. 1.18+/‐0.04 mmol/l (p<0.01)]. Mean serum levels of iPTH and total alkaline phosphatase in the LCD group were increased at 3 months and at the end of the study compared with the baseline levels [(38.6+/‐22.9 vs. 63.3+/‐46.0 vs. 78.6+/‐44.7 pg/ml); (59.5+/‐18.7 vs. 75.9+/‐26.7 vs. 84.0+/‐35.4 U/l)], respectively, and bone alkaline phosphatase increased also only after 6 months of treatment (23.4+/‐7.3 U/l vs. 35.6+/‐22.3). The bone markers in the HCD group did not change. At the end of the study all bone parameters in the LCD group were significantly higher than in the HCD group. CONCLUSION: There was an evolution towards parameters reflecting higher bone turnover in patients treated with dialysate calcium of 1.25 mmol/l, probably by prevention of a positive calcium balance and enabling sustained stimulation of PTH secretion. Hence, LCD might be considered a valuable therapeutic option for ABD patients.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Hemodialysis patients have a dramatically increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality risk. However, the best risk assessment is unknown. This study aimed to perform a comprehensive comparison of cardiovascular imaging techniques and traditional and non‐traditional serum risk factors with respect to their impact on all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: Data from 220 hemodialysis patients (mean age 59+/‐11 y) were analyzed with a mean follow‐up period of 692 days. Both single calcification sites (peripheral arteries and heart valves) and calcification scores (e.g. Adragao), ejection fraction, pulse wave velocity, intima media thickness (IMT) and traditional and non‐traditional serum risk factors were assessed. All parameters that were included into the final model were further statistically analysed by Cox regression. Results: Predictors for all‐cause mortality included IMT, the Adragao Score, CRP, age and gender. For cardiovascular mortality IMT, calcification scores, BNP, troponin T and hsCRP were significant predictors. In both models IMT showed the strongest impact for risk assessment (hazard ratio 123 and 79; confidence interval 7‐2280 and 1‐5400 for total and cardiovascular mortality, respectively; figure 1). Conclusions: IMT may serve as an effective screening tool to evaluate dialysis patients' risk for death and should be evaluated in other cohorts, as IMT is easy to assess, inexpensive and not time‐consuming.

abstract = {Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are common complications in renal transplant (RTx) recipients. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a hallmark of CVD. The current study aimed to elucidate the evolution and determinants of CAC in renal transplant recipients. Methods RTx recipients were randomly selected for a 3‐year prospective study. CAC score (CACS) was measured by MDCT scan. Patients were stratified into progressors and nonprogressors according to the definition proposed by Sevrukov et al, 2005. Results A total of 157 RTx patients were enrolled. At initiation, 47.8% had negligible CACS while 12.4% had CACS>1000. A higher CACS was associated with age (p=0.001), pretransplant diabetes mellitus (p=0.017), waist circumference (p=0.014) and body weight (p=0.037). A follow‐up MDCT scan was available in 101 cases at 2 years. CAC was progressed in 23.8% and regressed in 7.9% patients. Progressors had significantly higher basal serum creatinine (1.74+/‐0.66 vs 1.40+/‐0.49 mg/dl, p=0.007), more hypertension (84.0% vs 66.4%, p=0.066) and diabetes mellitus (33.3% vs 18.1%, p=0.095). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that serum creatinine was the only predictor of CAC progression. Conclusion The majority of CAC in RTx recipients could be stabilized in a 2‐year follow‐up and, in a small proportion, CAC even regressed.},

abstract = {The risk of death in hemodialysis patients treated with calcium‐containing phosphate binders or sevelamer is not known. We assessed all‐cause mortality in 127 patients new to hemodialysis assigned to calcium‐containing binders or sevelamer after a median follow‐up of 44 months from randomization. This was a predetermined secondary end point of a randomized clinical trial designed to assess progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores in the two treatment arms. Thirty‐four deaths occurred during the follow‐up period: 23 in subjects randomized to calcium‐containing phosphate binders and 11 in subjects randomized to sevelamer. Baseline CAC score was a significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age, race, gender, and diabetes with increased mortality proportional to baseline score (P=0.002). Mortality was borderline significantly lower in subjects randomized to sevelamer (5.3/100 patient years, confidence interval (CI) (2.2‐8.5) compared to those randomized to calcium‐containing binders (10.6/100 patient years, CI 6.3‐14.9) (P=0.05). The greater risk of death for patients treated with calcium‐containing phosphate binders persisted after full multivariable adjustment (P=0.016, hazard ratio 3.1, CI 1.23‐7.61). In subjects new to hemodialysis baseline CAC score was a significant predictor of all‐cause mortality. Treatment with sevelamer was associated with a significant survival benefit as compared to the use of calcium‐containing phosphate binders.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Emerging data has revealed that patients with nephrolithiasis are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and stroke. While nephrolithiasis occurs within a broad spectrum of human pathologic biomineralization, the overall association of nephrolithiasis with mineralization processes at non‐renal, non‐osseous sites is poorly understood. The objective of this study is to characterize the overall burden of systemic biomineralization in known kidney stone formers (SFs) compared to non stone formers (NSFs). METHODS: The presence and quantity of biomineralization at 9 non‐renal anatomic locations (listed in results) was determined by a blinded, retrospective review of clinical non‐contrast computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen/pelvis in known SFs (n = 71, mean age 52.3) and were compared to an age‐matched control group of NSFs (renal transplant donors, n=86, mean age 51.6). Each anatomic site of interest was assigned a mineralization score based on calculated CT volume of visible calcification (0 = none)( 1 = less than 0.5cm 3) ( 2 = 0.5cm3 to 1.0cm 3)( 3 = greater than 1.0cm 3). Patients were also evaluated for age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, and stone type. RESULTS: The average systemic mineralization score was significantly higher in stone formers (4.14) compared to controls (2.16). SFs were more likely than NSFs to have mineral densities in the heart (19.7% vs 3.4%), aorta (46.5% vs 23.2%), iliac arteries (38.0% vs 14.0%),spleen/splenic artery (8.95% vs 4.7%), mesentery (15.5% vs 4.7%), uterus (48.34% vs 46.7%), prostate (62.2% vs 24.0%), and pancreas (8.45% vs 0.0%). The presence of pelvic phleboliths was similar in both groups (62.0% vs 62.8%). Site‐specific mineralization scores were higher in SFs at all anatomic sites (Fig 1). SFs also had higher degree of obesity (BMI 29.73 vs 27.8) and higher rates of comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: SFs have increased mineralization at many anatomic sites compared to NSFs. Understanding nephrolithiasis within the context of systemic biomineralization may help to better elucidate underlying mechanisms of nephrolithiasis and other pathologic biomineralization processes.},

abstract = {Insufficient control of serum calcium and phosphate levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis is associated with increased mortality. As commonly used calcium‐containing phosphate binders can cause arterial calcification, newly developed calcium‐free phosphate binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) and lanthanum carbonate (LC), have received much attention. We assessed the efficacy and safety of SH and LC treatment in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis in a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover study. Forty‐two patients were randomized to receive SH or LC for 13 weeks, with the dosages adjusted every 2 weeks, followed by treatment with the other drug for another 13 weeks. The average daily doses of SH and LC were 2971 ± 1464 mg and 945 ± 449 mg, respectively. The mean dosage ratio of SH to LC was 3.05, which was maintained throughout the treatment period. SH and LC were similarly effective at controlling serum calcium and phosphate levels in the majority of patients (78‐93%). A few serious adverse events (AEs) involving the biliary system occurred during the LC treatment period, but they were not considered to be treatment‐induced. Although the incidence of constipation, the most common treatment‐related AE, was higher during the SH period (27% vs. 5%; P < 0.05), no difference was observed in total treatment‐related AEs. This study demonstrates that SH and LC are comparable treatments for controlling serum phosphate and calcium levels, and that both compounds are safe and well‐tolerated in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether the use of sevelamer rather than a calcium‐containing phosphate binder improves cardiovascular (CV) survival in patients receiving dialysis remains to be elucidated. STUDY DESIGN: Open‐label randomized controlled trial with parallel groups. SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: 466 incident hemodialysis patients recruited from 18 centers in Italy. INTERVENTION: Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either sevelamer or a calcium‐containing phosphate binder (although not required by the protocol, all patients in this group received calcium carbonate) for 24 months. OUTCOMES: All individuals were followed up until completion of 36 months of follow‐up or censoring. CV death due to cardiac arrhythmias was regarded as the primary end point. MEASUREMENTS: Blind event adjudication. RESULTS: At baseline, patients allocated to sevelamer had higher serum phosphorus (mean, 5.6 ± 1.7 [SD] vs 4.8 ± 1.4 mg/dL) and C‐reactive protein levels (mean, 8.8 ± 13.4 vs 5.9 ± 6.8 mg/dL) and lower coronary artery calcification scores (median, 19 [IQR, 0‐30] vs 30 [IQR, 7‐180]). At study completion, serum phosphate levels were lower in the sevelamer arm (median dosages, 4,800 and 2,000 mg/d for sevelamer and calcium carbonate, respectively). After a mean follow‐up of 28 ± 10 months, 128 deaths were recorded (29 and 88 due to cardiac arrhythmias and all‐cause CV death). Sevelamer‐treated patients experienced lower CV mortality due to cardiac arrhythmias compared with patients treated with calcium carbonate (HR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01‐0.25; P < 0.001). Similar results were noted for all‐cause CV mortality and all‐cause mortality, but not for non‐CV mortality. Adjustments for potential confounders did not affect results. LIMITATIONS: Open‐label design, higher baseline coronary artery calcification burden in calcium carbonate‐treated patients, different mineral metabolism control in sevelamer‐treated patients, overall lower than expected mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that sevelamer compared to a calcium‐containing phosphate binder improves survival in a cohort of incident hemodialysis patients. However, the better outcomes in the sevelamer group may be due to better phosphate control rather than reduction in calcium load.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by‐stander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with older age, male gender, non‐black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher serum calcium, higher serum calcium‐phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate time‐dependent Cox model using baseline and follow‐up values of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly associated with increased hazard of all‐cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 ‐ 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 ‐ 1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis patients.},
