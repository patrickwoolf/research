TI  - Hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Kidney Disease.
BTI - Endotext
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) isassociatedwith amineraland 
      bonedisorder(CKD-MBD)whichstarts early in the course of the disease and worsens with 
      its progression. The main initial serum biochemistry abnormalities are increases in 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreases in 
      1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol) and soluble a-Klotho (Klotho), allowing serum 
      calcium and phosphate to stay normal. However, in later CKD stages hyperphosphatemia 
      develops in the majority of patients, and serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (calcidiol) 
      decreases. Serum calcium may stay normal, decrease, or increase. More recent studies 
      suggest that circulating Wnt-b-catenin pathway inhibitors such as sclerostin and 
      Dickkopf-1 also play an important role in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD.Both the 
      synthesis and the secretion of PTH are continuously stimulated, resulting in 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism.In addition to the complex effects of the above 
      systemic disturbances parathyroid tissue downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), 
      calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), and Klotho – a local co-receptor of cognate 
      fibroblast growth factor receptors of FGF23 – further aggravates the impaired 
      control of PTH synthesis and secretion. More recently, miRNAs have been shown to 
      also contribute to the stimulation of the parathyroid in the uremic state. The 
      chronic stimulation of parathyroid secretory function is not only characterized by a 
      progressive rise in serum PTH but also by parathyroid gland hyperplasia. It results 
      from an increase in parathyroid cell proliferation which is not fully compensated by 
      a concomitant increase in parathyroid cell apoptosis. Parathyroid hyperplasia is 
      initially of the diffuse, polyclonal type. In late CKD stages it often evolves 
      towards a nodular, monoclonal or multiclonal type of growth. Enhanced parathyroid 
      expression of transforming growth factor-a and its receptor, the epidermal growth 
      factor receptor, is involvedin polyclonal hyperplasia.Chromosomal changes have been 
      found to be associated with clonal outgrowth in some, but notthe majority of benign 
      parathyroid tumors removed from patients with end-stage renal disease.In initial CKD 
      stagesskeletal resistance to the action of PTH may explain why low bone turnover 
      predominates in a significant proportion of patients, together with other conditions 
      inhibiting bone turnover such as reduced calcitriol levels, sex hormone deficiency, 
      diabetes, and uremic toxins, leading to repression of osteocyte Wnt-b-catenin 
      pathway signaling and increased expression of Wntantagonists such as sclerostin and 
      Dickkopf-1. High turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa) occurs only later on, when 
      serum PTH levels are able to overcome skeletal PTH resistance. The diagnosis of 
      secondary uremic hyperparathyroidism and osteitis fibrosa relies at present mainly 
      on serum biochemistry. X-ray examination of the skeleton is useful only in severe 
      forms. It also allows assessment of concomitant vascular calcification. From a 
      therapeutic point of view, it is important to prevent the development of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism as early as possible in the course of CKD. A variety of 
      prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are available, as outlined in the final part 
      of the chapter. For complete coverage of all related areas of Endocrinology, please

TI  - Inflammatory Markers for Arterial Stiffness in Cardiovascular Diseases.
PG  - 1058
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01058 [doi]
LID - 1058
AB  - Arterial stiffness predicts an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Inflammation 
      plays a major role in large arteries stiffening, related to atherosclerosis, 
      arteriosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle cell migration, vascular 
      calcification, increased activity of metalloproteinases, extracellular matrix 
      degradation, oxidative stress, elastolysis, and degradation of collagen. The present 
      paper reviews main mechanisms explaining the crosstalk between inflammation and 
      arterial stiffness and the most common inflammatory markers associated with 
      increased arterial stiffness, considering the most recent clinical and experimental 
      studies. Diverse studies revealed significant correlations between the severity of 
      arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell count, 
      neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, adhesion molecules, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, 
      cytokines, microRNAs, and cyclooxygenase-2, in patients with a broad variety of 
      diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, coronary heart disease, peripheral 
      arterial disease, malignant and rheumatic disorders, polycystic kidney disease, 
      renal transplant, familial Mediterranean fever, and oral infections, and in women 
      with preeclampsia or after menopause. There is strong evidence that inflammation 
      plays an important and, at least, partly reversible role in the development of 
      arterial stiffness, and inflammatory markers may be useful additional tools in the 
      assessment of the cardiovascular risk in clinical practice. Combined assessment of 
      arterial stiffness and inflammatory markers may improve non-invasive assessment of 
      cardiovascular risk, enabling selection of high-risk patients for prophylactic 
      treatment or more regular medical examination. Development of future destiffening 
      therapies may target pro-inflammatory mechanisms.

TI  - Dialysis initiation improves calcification propensity.
PG  - 495-502
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is high in patients starting 
      dialysis and could be related to modifications of calcification inducers and 
      inhibitors by dialysis, promoting cardiovascular events. The impact of dialysis 
      initiation on serum calcification propensity evolution and arterial stiffness is 
      unknown. We therefore prospectively determined the evolution of the one-half maximal 
      transition time (T50) value and its main determinants as well as pulse wave velocity 
      over the first 3 months of dialysis initiation. METHODS: We analysed the evolution 
      of T50, fetuin-A and mineral metabolism parameters before dialysis initiation (M0) 
      and monthly until Month 3 (M3) in incident patients starting haemodialysis (HD) or 
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) in two tertiary Swiss university hospitals. Arterial 
      stiffness was assessed by pulse tonometry at M0 and M3 and biological parameters 
      were compared between M0 and M3 and before/after HD. Linear mixed models were used 
      to assess parameter evolution over time, taking into account repeated measures and 
      other influencing variables. RESULTS: Forty-six patients on HD and 12 on PD were 
      followed. Among them, 45 were male (78%) with a median age of 67 years (25th-75th 
      quartile range 54-77). T50 significantly increased between M0 and M3 from 183 
      (120-266) to 246 min (175-330) (P < 0.001). Fetuin-A, calcium and magnesium also 
      increased while phosphate decreased. Factors associated with T50 changes over time 
      were fetuin-A, phosphate and magnesium (P < 0.001). Fetuin-A changes were associated 
      with inflammation-related factors (albumin, C-reactive protein) but not calcium and 
      phosphate levels. Arterial stiffness was not significantly modified over 3 months. 
      PD and HD initiation showed similar trends. CONCLUSIONS: Dialysis initiation 
      significantly improves calcification propensity and fetuin-A levels. These 
      modifications do not explain the high mortality related to dialysis initiation. The 
      clinical relevance of using T50 values to initiate dialysis awaits further studies.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejvs.2019.01.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is central to haemodialysis treatment, 
      but up to half of surgically created AVF fail to mature. Chronic kidney disease 
      often leads to mineral metabolism disturbances that may interfere with AVF 
      maturation through adverse vascular effects. This study tested associations between 
      mineral metabolism markers and vein histology at AVF creation and unassisted and 
      overall clinical AVF maturation. METHODS: Concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 
      23, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolites: 
      1,25(OH)(2)D, 24,25(OH)(2)D, 25(OH)D, and bioavailable 25(OH)D were measured in 
      pre-operative serum samples from 562 of 602 participants in the Haemodialysis 
      Fistula Maturation Study, a multicentre, prospective cohort study of patients 
      undergoing surgical creation of an autologous upper extremity AVF. Unassisted and 
      overall AVF maturation were ascertained for 540 and 527 participants, respectively, 
      within nine months of surgery or four weeks of dialysis initiation. Study personnel 
      obtained vein segments adjacent to the portion of the vein used for anastomosis, 
      which were processed, embedded, and stained for measurement of neointimal 
      hyperplasia, calcification, and collagen deposition in the medial wall. RESULTS: 
      Participants in this substudy were 71% male, 43% black, and had a mean age of 55 
      years. Failure to achieve AVF maturation without assistance occurred in 288 (53%) 
      participants for whom this outcome was determined. In demographic and further 
      adjusted models, mineral metabolism markers were not significantly associated with 
      vein histology characteristics, unassisted AVF maturation failure, or overall 
      maturation failure, other than a biologically unexplained association of higher 
      24,25(OH)(2)D with overall failure. This exception aside, associations were 
      non-significant for continuous and categorical analyses and relevant subgroups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of measured mineral metabolites were not 
      substantially associated with major histological characteristics of veins in 
      patients undergoing AVF creation surgery, or with AVF maturation failure, suggesting 
      that efforts to improve AVF maturation rates should increase attention to other 
      processes such as vein mechanics, anatomy, and cellular metabolism among end stage 
      renal disease patients.

TI  - Intraoperative Arterial Biopsy in Incident Hemodialysis Patients: Differences 
      Observed.
PG  - 54-61
LID - 10.1159/000500486 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial calcification (AC) is a common complication in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients that starts to develop before these patients need renal 
      replacement therapy. In these patients, calcification can involve tunica intima or 
      tunica media. This study has looked for the prevalence, severity, and distribution 
      of arterial wall calcification in incident hemodialysis patients through 
      intraoperative arterial biopsy obtained during creation of arteriovenous vascular 
      access for hemodialysis. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults 
      (98 male and 74 female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained 
      arterial samples, all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF23), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D. RESULTS: Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC 
      (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal (subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), 
      while 21 (12%) had both intimal and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six 
      patients (50%) were devoid of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly 
      higher serum level of PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose 
      significant difference in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. 
      On the other hand, there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, 
      serum PTH, and FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification. 
      CONCLUSION: Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly in 
      tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification intensity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification and stiffness are associated with higher 
      mortality and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients, but the underlying 
      mechanism is not well elucidated and previous studies have been contradictory. We 
      sought to determine the association of circulating calcification biomarkers with 
      calcification, stiffness, and mortality in a multiethnic incident dialysis 
      population. METHODS: Among 391 incident hemodialysis participants enrolled in the 
      Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) 
      study, we examined the cross-sectional associations of baseline fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF23), desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), 
      fetuin-A, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) according to total coronary artery calcium score 
      (CAC, using the Agatston calcification criteria) at baseline, vascular stiffness 
      (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) over 4 study visits, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 
      Patients' mean age was 55 years; 40% were female, 72% were African American, and 58% 
      had diabetes. Higher OPG and FGF23 were associated with a 1.09-fold (per 5-pmol/l 
      increase in OPG; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.17) and 1.12-fold (per 
      increase of 100 log RU/ml in FGF23; 95% CI: 1.02‒1.34) higher prevalence of CAC, 
      independent of demographics, comorbidities, dialysis factors, and serum klotho 
      levels. Higher OPG was associated with higher baseline PWV. Higher FGF23 was 
      associated with lower PWV over follow-up. dp-ucMGP and fetuin-A were not associated 
      with either CAC or vascular stiffness. After adjustment, circulating biomarkers were 
      not associated with mortality risk. CONCLUSION: Several circulating calcification 
      biomarkers were only modestly associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease in 
      an incident multiethnic hemodialysis population; none were associated with 
      mortality. Understanding whether these associations persist in larger, diverse 
      hemodialysis populations is warranted before planning trials.

TI  - Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Level Predicts Cardiac Valve Calcification in Maintenance 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 550-559
LID - 10.1159/000505846 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiac valve calcification (CVC) is frequently occurred in maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause 
      mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between risk factors and 
      extent of CVC and further provide the treatment target in MHD patients. METHODS: One 
      hundred and forty-five patients who received MHD ≥3 months were enrolled. CVC was 
      assessed by an echocardiographic, semi-quantitative manner called global cardiac 
      calcium scoring system (GCCS), and demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters 
      including mineral metabolism markers were collected. RESULTS: The average age of the 
      patients was 50 ± 12 years, and 54.5% were men. The mean GCCS was 1.8 ± 2.4; 57.2% 
      of patients had GCCS ≥1. Age, dialysis vintage, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
      and intact parathyroid hormone levels were positively correlated with CVC, whereas 
      serum albumin levels were negatively related to CVC, based on univariate analysis. 
      With multivariate linear regression analysis, serum ALP was the only bone-derived 
      biomarker that showed significant correlation with CVC. Serum ALP ≥232 U/L was a 
      robust predictor of CVC and was associated with the likelihood of GCCS ≥1 (OR 3.92, 
      95% CI 1.37-11.2, p = 0.011). The decision tree model was used to identify ALP ≥232 
      U/L and age ≥60 years as important determinative variables in the prediction of CVC 
      in MHD patients. CONCLUSION: Serum ALP level is significantly associated with CVC in 
      MHD patients. ALP is suggested to be a promising interventional target for 
      cardiovascular calcification in MHD patients.

TI  - Vascular calcification is associated with Wnt-signaling pathway and blood pressure 
      variability in chronic kidney disease rats.
PG  - 264-272
LID - 10.1111/nep.13677 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and has been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular events and 
      mortality. This study was to explore the role of Wnt-signaling pathway in CKD VC, 
      and the association between VC and blood pressure variability (BPV) which is a risk 
      factor of cardiovascular events. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      divided into adenine-induced CKD group (n = 5), 5/6 nephrectomy CKD group (n = 5), 
      sham group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). Low-calcium-high-phosphate diets were 
      introduced to induce vascular calcification. Both daytime (hour-to-hour during the 
      day) and mid-term (day-to-day for 9 days) blood pressure (BP) were collected and 
      analyzed for BPV metrics. At sacrifice, kidney, heart and aorta samples were taken 
      for histological analyses. Calcium deposition in aorta was identified with Alizarin 
      Red stain and graded. Immunohistochemistry stain and western blot were performed for 
      Wnt3a, Wnt5a, β-catenin, sclerostin, osteopontin, and α-SMA. RESULTS: Compared with 
      control rats, CKD rats suffered from markedly severer VC (Grade 2.6 ± 0.2 and 
      1.8 ± 0.8 vs 0.0 ± 0.0 and 0.2 ± 0.4, P = .0010). VC was positively correlated with 
      vascular Wnt3a and β-catenin expression (P = .0032 and .0000), but not significantly 
      associated with Wnta5a or sclerostin. Besides, CKD rats showed increased BPV 
      (P < .001), which was also positively correlated with VC. CONCLUSION: We confirmed 
      that CKD rats had enhanced Wnt-signaling in vascular tissue and severer aorta 
      calcification together with increased BPV. Wnt pathway may be a potential target in 
      future VC and BPV management in CKD.

TI  - Recombinant α-Klotho Protein Alleviated Acute Cardiorenal Injury in a Mouse Model of 
      Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Septic Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 5.
PG  - 5853426
LID - 10.1155/2019/5853426 [doi]
LID - 5853426
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Klotho is an aging-suppressor gene mainly expressed in the 
      renal tubules. The klotho gene encodes the α-klotho protein, which has many 
      functions. Previous studies have found that α-klotho protein has a cardiorenal 
      protective function. α-Klotho deficiency renders the kidney more susceptible to 
      injury and results in cardiovascular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy 
      in chronic kidney disease. However, the role of α-klotho in acute heart injury and 
      acute kidney injury with sepsis remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the 
      effects and mechanisms of α-klotho in septic cardiorenal injury. METHODS: Male 
      8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the control group, 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 mg/kg) group, LPS (10 mg/kg)+α-klotho (0.01 mg/kg) 
      group, and LPS (10 mg/kg)+α-klotho (0.02 mg/kg) group. Recombinant α-klotho was 
      intraperitoneally injected an hour before LPS injection. Mice were euthanized at 24 
      h after LPS injection. The serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 
      neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and creatinine levels were 
      measured in all groups at 24 h. Biomarkers of mice heart apoptosis, inflammation, 
      oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as caspase-3, interleukin 1 
      (IL-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), 
      were also measured. RESULTS: α-Klotho was mainly expressed in mice kidneys and was 
      undetectable in the control mice hearts. α-Klotho substantially decreased after LPS 
      injection. In the LPS group, the serum troponin levels significantly increased as 
      early as 6 h (p < 0.05) after LPS injection, while the BNP, NGAL, and creatinine 
      levels significantly increased at 24 h (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with α-klotho 
      significantly ameliorated acute cardiorenal injury. In the LPS+α-klotho (0.01 mg/kg) 
      group, the levels of apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress were decreased, 
      while the level of endoplasmic reticulum stress was elevated. CONCLUSIONS: α-Klotho 
      significantly alleviates acute cardiorenal injury in LPS-induced septic cardiorenal 
      injury due to the inhibition of apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidation, as well as 
      the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress levels.

TI  - The effect of lanthanum carbonate on calciprotein particles in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 323-329
LID - 10.1007/s10157-019-01832-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregation of solid-phase calcium-phosphate and fetuin-A form 
      nanoparticles called calciprotein particles (CPP). Serum CPP levels are increased in 
      CKD patients and correlated with vascular stiffness and calcification. In this 
      study, we evaluated effects of lanthanum carbonate (LC) and calcium carbonate (CC) 
      on serum CPP levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Twenty-four (24) HD 
      patients (50% men, age; 68 ± 12 years, dialysis period; 6.2 ± 4.8 years, Kt/v; 1.74 
      ± 0.34) were treated with CC during 0-8 weeks and then switched to LC during 9-16 
      weeks. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 8, 16 weeks. Serum CPP levels (TCPP) were 
      measured by the gel-filtration method. Low-density CPP (LCPP) levels were determined 
      by centrifuging the serum samples at 16,000 g for 2 h and measuring CPP levels in 
      the supernatant. The difference between TCPP and LCPP was defined as the 
      high-density CPP (HCPP) level. We evaluated association of TCPP, LCPP, and HCPP with 
      serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact PTH, FGF23, Klotho, fetuin-A, aortic 
      calcification index (ACI), LDL cholesterol, and hs-CRP. RESULTS: TCPP and LCPP 
      levels were significantly decreased after switching CC to LC, whereas Ca and P 
      levels were not changed. HCPP levels were below the lower limit quantification in 
      all patients. The changes in P, Ca × P, LDL cholesterol, but not ACI and the changes 
      in hs-CRP, were correlated with the change in TCPP levels. CONCLUSION: The TCPP 
      levels were significantly decreased after switching CC to LC. Non-calcium-containing 
      phosphate binders may be preferable for lowering CPP levels.

TI  - Proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycan and collagen content in the arterial wall of patients 
      with end-stage renal disease: new indicators of vascular disease.
PG  - 781-789
LID - 10.20452/pamw.15022 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) comorbidity in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, particularly in end‑stage renal disease 
      (ESRD). There is an ongoing search for novel biomarkers of CV disease in this 
      population. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the associations of matrix 
      proteoglycans (PGs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen, and arterial 
      calcifications with selected serum and plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction, 
      inflammation, oxidative stress, and bone turnover in patients with ESRD. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: We enrolled 47 adult patients (32 men) with stage 5 CKD. The following 
      parameters were investigated: fibrinogen, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), plasminogen 
      activator inhibitor 1 (PAI‑1), stromal cell‑derived factor 1α (SDF‑1α), calcium 
      (Ca), phosphate (Pi), intact parathormone, interleukin 6, high‑sensitivity 
      C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP), ferric reducing ability of plasma, 
      2,2‑diphenyl‑1‑picrylhydrazyl scavenging, ferric reducing ability of ascorbate in 
      plasma, fetuin‑A, fibroblast growth factor 23, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, 
      osteocalcin, transforming growth factor β (TGF‑β), hepatocyte growth factor, 
      secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2. 
      Radial artery specimens were stained with alizarin red for calcifications, alcian 
      blue for PGs and GAGs, and sirius red for collagen. RESULTS: We observed positive 
      correlations between PG and GAG, collagen, and calcification staining. The most 
      intense (grade 3) alcian blue staining was significantly correlated with diabetes as 
      well as higher levels of Ca × Pi product, hs‑CRP, fibrinogen, SDF‑1α, PAI‑1, and 
      sTM. However, PAI‑1 was the only significant predictor of grade 3 alcian blue 
      staining in a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for hemodialysis, Ca× Pi 
      product, and hs‑CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulation disorders and endothelial 
      dysfunction are the hallmarks of ESRD. The levels of SDF‑1α, PAI‑1, sTM, and 
      fibrinogen may be novel predictors of early vascular wall alterations and may serve 
      as CV risk markers.

TI  - The impact of vascular calcification among dialysis-dependent South African 
      patients: A 5-year follow-up study .
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.5414/CN110010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In Western 
      countries, Blacks appear to have lesser degrees of vascular calcification compared 
      to non-Blacks. However, there is no published data from sub-Saharan Africa. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study assessed the 5-year change in vascular 
      calcification and mortality in a previously published cohort of patients with ESRD. 
      Vascular calcification was assessed by abdominal aortic calcification score and 
      vascular stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: 66 of the original 74 
      participants studied at baseline were identified. The median age was 46.6 years 
      (37.6 - 59.2), and 57.6% were women. Abdominal aortic calcification showed no 
      progression among Blacks (baseline range 0 - 5, follow-up range 0 - 8 (p = 1.00)), 
      but a trend to progression among non-Blacks (baseline range 0 - 19, follow up range 
      0 - 22 (p = 0.066)). Black participants did not display a survival advantage 
      (p = 0.870). Non-Blacks had higher parathyroidectomy rates than Blacks with 9/30 
      cases compared to 2/36 (p = 0.036). After adjustment for parathyroidectomy at 
      follow-up, the odds ratio of having abdominal vascular calcification score of ≥ 1 
      amongst non-Blacks was 8.6-fold greater compared to Blacks (p = 0.03). A positive 
      correlation (r = 0.5) was observed between PWV and abdominal aortic calcification 
      (p = 0.047). Elevated baseline coronary artery calcification score and FGF-23 level 
      at baseline were not associated with a difference in mortality. CONCLUSION: There 
      was no significant progression in vascular calcification among Blacks. After 
      adjusting for increased parathyroidectomy rates, there was a greater progression of 
      vascular calcification amongst non-Blacks compared to Blacks.

TI  - Relationship of Serum Soluble Klotho Levels and Echocardiographic Parameters in 
      Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 396-404
LID - 10.1159/000499200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
      in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Uremic cardiomyopathy, characterized by 
      myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, has a significant contribution to these adverse 
      cardiac outcomes. The protective effect of soluble Klotho (s-Klotho) on myocardial 
      damage was demonstrated in in vitro and animal experiments. However, data from MHD 
      patients is limited. The present study was designed to identify potential 
      correlations between echocardiographic parameters and serum s-Klotho levels in MHD 
      patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 105 MHD patients from 
      the Dialysis Center of Capital Medical University affiliated Beijing Friendship 
      Hospital between March and October 2014. The general information for each patient 
      was recorded. Fasting blood samples were collected prior to hemodialysis during the 
      mid-week session in all patients. The echocardiogram and left lateral lumbar spine 
      radiograph were performed after the same mid-week session. The dialysis records for 
      each session within 3 months before the blood tests were documented. According to 
      the quartiles of s-Klotho levels, patients were divided into four groups (Group 
      1-4). The demographic and clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, 
      and abdominal aortic calcification scores among the groups were compared. RESULTS: 
      The enrolled 105 patients were predominantly male (54.3%) with an average age of 
      59.9 ± 11.2 years. Previous hemodialysis durations were 76 (42-133) months. Sixteen 
      (15.2%) patients had diabetes mellitus. Mean serum s-Klotho level was 411.83 ± 
      152.95 pg/mL, and the 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile values 
      of serum s-Klotho levels were 298.9, 412, and 498.2 pg/mL, respectively. Individuals 
      in the bottom quartile of s-Klotho levels (Group 1) had significantly increased 
      interventricular septal thickness (IVST) compared to those in the other three 
      quartiles of s-Klotho levels (Group 1: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm; vs. Group 2: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm, 
      p = 0.008; vs. Group 3: 0.94 ± 0.13 cm, p < 0.001; vs. Group 4: 1.03 ± 0.1 5 cm, p = 
      0.022). There were significant differences in the ratios of IVST and posterior wall 
      thickness (PWT) between patients of Group 1 and Group 3 (1.12 ± 0.1 2 vs. 1.00 ± 0.1 
      4, p = 0.004). No significant differences were found for other parameters among the 
      groups. The univariate correlation analyses showed that gender (r = -0.211, p = 
      0.030), Kt/V urea (r = -0.240, p = 0.014), hypersensitive C reactive protein 
      (hs-CRP) (r = 0.196, p = 0.045), and serum s-Klotho levels (r = -0.260, p = 0.007) 
      significantly correlated with IVST. Ultimately, only hs-CRP and serum s-Klotho 
      levels were entered into a multiple regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The present study 
      showed that patients with lower circulating s-Klotho levels were more often 
      associated with larger IVST and greater ratios of IVST and PWT. There was an 
      independent association between s-Klotho and IVST, and lower s-Klotho levels seem to 
      be a potential risk factor of uremic cardiomyopathy in MHD patients.

TI  - Association of serum phosphorus and calcium x phosphate product with mortality risk 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients: a national study.
PG  - 607-17
AB  - Elevated serum phosphorus is a predictable accompaniment of end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) in the absence of dietary phosphate restriction or supplemental phosphate 
      binders. The consequences of hyperphosphatemia include the development and 
      progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism and a predisposition to metastatic 
      calcification when the product of serum calcium and phosphorus (Ca x PO4) is 
      elevated. Both of these conditions may contribute to the substantial morbidity and 
      mortality seen in patients with ESRD. We have analyzed the distribution of serum 
      phosphorus in two large national, random, cross-sectional samples of hemodialysis 
      patients who have been receiving dialysis for at least 1 year. Data were obtained 
      from two special studies of the United States Renal Data System, the Case Mix 
      Adequacy Study (1990) and the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 1 (1993). 
      The relative risk of death by serum phosphorus quintiles is described after 
      adjusting for age at onset of ESRD, race, sex, smoking status, and the presence of 
      diabetes, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and/or neoplasm. Logistic 
      regression analysis is then used to describe the demographic, comorbid, and 
      laboratory parameters associated with high serum phosphorus. Serum phosphorus was 
      similar in these two study populations and averaged 6.2 mg/dL. Ten percent of 
      patients had levels greater than 9 mg/dL and at least 30% of each group had serum 
      phosphorus levels greater than 7 mg/dL. The adjusted relative risk of death by serum 
      phosphorus level was not uniform across all quintiles, being constant below a level 
      of 6.5 mg/dL and increasing significantly above this level. The relative risk of 
      death for those with a serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL was 1.27 relative to 
      those with a serum phosphorus of 2.4 to 6.5 mg/dL. This increased risk was not 
      diminished by statistical adjustment for coexisting medical conditions, delivered 
      dose of dialysis, nutritional parameters, or markers of noncompliance. Evaluation of 
      predictors of serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL revealed in multivariate 
      analysis that younger age at onset of ESRD, female sex, white race, diabetes, active 
      smoking, and higher serum creatinine levels were all significant predictors. 
      Analysis of serum calcium revealed no correlation with relative risk of death. The 
      Ca x PO4 product, however, showed a mortality risk trend similar to that seen with 
      serum phosphorus alone. Those in the highest quintile of the Ca x PO4 product (>72 
      mg2/dL2) had a relative mortality risk of 1.34 relative to those with products of 42 
      to 52 mg2/dL2. The relative mortality risk by log parathyroid hormone (PTH) level 
      was elevated for patients with higher levels, but the mortality risk associated with 
      hyperphosphatemia was independent of PTH. For hemodialysis patients who have been 
      receiving dialysis for at least 1 year, we conclude that a large percentage have a 
      serum phosphorus level above 6.5 mg/dL and that this places them at increased risk 
      of death. This increased risk is independent of PTH. The mechanism(s) responsible 
      for death is unknown, but may be related to an abnormally high Ca x PO4 product. 
      Although mechanisms are not clearly established, this study supports the need for 
      vigorous control of hyperphosphatemia to improve patient survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) and is a significant risk factor for future cardiovascular events and death. 
      Warfarin use results in dysfunction of matrix Gla protein, an inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification. However, the effect of warfarin on vascular calcification in patients 
      with ESRD is still not well characterized. Thus we investigated whether arterial 
      calcification can be accelerated by warfarin treatment both in vitro and in vivo 
      using a mouse remnant kidney model. METHODS: Human aortic smooth muscle cells 
      (HASMC) were cultured in medium supplemented with warfarin and phosphate to 
      investigate the potential role of this drug in osteoblast transdifferentiation. For 
      in vivo study, adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy were treated with 
      active vitamin D3 plus warfarin to determine the extent of vascular calcification 
      and parameters of cardiovascular function. RESULTS: We found that the expressions of 
      Runx2 and osteocalcin in HASMC were markedly enhanced in the culture medium 
      containing warfarin and high phosphate concentration. Warfarin induced calcification 
      of cultured HASMC in the presence of high phosphate levels, and this effect is 
      inhibited by vitamin K2. Severe aortic calcification and reduced left ventricular 
      ejection fractions were also noted in 5/6 nephrectomy mice treated with warfarin and 
      active vitamin D3. CONCLUSION: Warfarin treatment contributes to the accelerated 
      vascular calcification in animal models of advanced chronic kidney disease. 
      Clinicians should therefore be aware of the profound risk of warfarin use on 
      vascular calcification and cardiac dysfunction in patients with ESRD and atrial 
      fibrillation.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 142-7
LID - 10.1038/hr.2011.155 [doi]
AB  - Menopause is derived from the Greek words men (month) and pauses (cessation) and 
      means permanent cessation of menstruation after the loss of ovarian activity. 
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has recently been associated with cardiovascular events 
      in several studies. CKD patients have a heavy burden of traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors in addition to a range of nontraditional risk factors such as 
      inflammation and abnormal metabolism of calcium and phosphate. In this review, the 
      association of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as of osteoporosis in 
      postmenopausal women is discussed. CKD mineral and bone disorder, characterized by 
      disturbances of calcium/phosphate/parathyroid hormone, bone abnormalities and 
      vascular and soft tissue calcification, is highly prevalent in CKD and is a strong, 
      independent predictor of bone fracture, CVD and death. Estrogen has been shown to: 
      (a) decrease the expression of angiotensin type 1 receptors in vasculature and 
      kidneys; (b) reduce the expression and activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, 
      and (c) cause the release of angiotensinogen substrate from the liver. However, the 
      degree of activation or suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by 
      estrogen has not been clearly established. Clinical data on the effects of estrogen 
      therapy on bone mineral densities are extremely limited in the ESRD population. CVD 
      is the most common cause of death in postmenopausal women with CKD and many 
      contributing factors have been explored. Future research for prevention of CVD in 
      postmenopausal women with CKD would focus on the biology of vascular calcification 
      as well as bone loss.

TI  - Newly Developed Rat Model of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disorder.
PG  - 170-177
LID - 10.5551/jat.40170 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is associated with 
      all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Thus, 
      elucidating its pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improving the 
      prognosis. We evaluated characteristics of CKD-MBD in a newly developed CKD rat 
      model. METHODS: We used male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and spontaneously diabetic 
      Torii (SDT) rats, which are used as models for nonobese type 2 diabetes. CKD was 
      induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx). At 10 weeks, the rats were classified into six 
      groups and administered with a vehicle or a low- or high-dose paricalcitol thrice a 
      week. At 20 weeks, the rats were sacrificed; blood and urinary biochemical analyses 
      and histological analysis of the aorta were performed. RESULTS: At 20 weeks, 
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure, and renal function were not 
      significantly different among the six groups. Serum calcium and phosphate levels 
      tended to be higher in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. The urinary excretion of 
      calcium and phosphate was significantly greater in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. 
      After administering paricalcitol, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were significantly higher in SDT-Nx rats than in 
      SD-Nx rats. The degree of aortic calcification was significantly more severe and the 
      aortic calcium content was significantly greater in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that our new CKD rat model using SDT rats represents a 
      useful CKD-MBD model, and this model was greatly influenced by paricalcitol 
      administration. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanisms 
      underlying this model.

TI  - The role of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use in vitamin K status.
PG  - e0203157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203157 [doi]
LID - e0203157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal 
      disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney 
      transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular calcification. 
      Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by vitamin-K-dependent matrix 
      γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney transplantation or phosphate 
      binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. Therefore, we studied the influence of 
      kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on vitamin K status. METHODS: We 
      measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low 
      vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82), 
      peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n = 
      36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear 
      regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder 
      use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential confounders. 
      RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP levels 
      were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 pmol/L) 
      compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients 
      on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate binder was not associated 
      with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) compared to no phosphate binders 
      (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used sevelamer monotherapy, which was 
      associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist use. CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney 
      transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin 
      K status after transplantation. Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher 
      dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more 
      attention to vitamin K status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for 
      protection against vascular calcification.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy as a Cure for Calciphylaxis in a Non-Dialysis Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Patient?
PG  - 1170-1174
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.917105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Calciphylaxis is a rare and fatal systemic disease which most commonly 
      occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is a poorly understood vascular 
      calcification with unclear pathology that leads to vascular compromise due to 
      vascular occlusion with endoluminal calcification. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 
      61-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who developed calciphylaxis. 
      The patient was diagnosed with dry gangrene of the second and third digits of the 
      right hand and second, third, and fourth phalanges of the left hand. Despite medical 
      therapy and local wound care, the lesions progressively worsened with time. The 
      patient was found to have secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone was 
      1028 pg/mL) and underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy. In our patient, the skin 
      lesions due to calciphylaxis completely resolved over the course of 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS Parathyroidectomy has been associated with clinical benefit in patients 
      with calciphylaxis. Clinicians should consider parathyroidectomy in the setting of 
      high parathyroid hormone and calciphylaxis. Although parathyroidectomy is an 
      effective treatment option for calciphylaxis it is not a definitive treatment and 
      calciphylaxis can occur, though rarely, even after parathyroidectomy. There is a 
      need to do further studies in order to confirm the efficacy of parathyroidectomy.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 137-142
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1740-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign of 
      severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. Fetuin-A and 
      osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD therapy. However, 
      there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on dialysis. The aim of 
      our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the relationship between VC and 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and independent predictors of VC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. 
      Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient group was 
      compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A plain 
      radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the evaluation of 
      VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both patients and controls 
      were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients 
      were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly 
      lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly 
      higher in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were 
      independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the following 
      factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was 
      found between patients with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, 
      and 25-OH-vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients 
      undergoing HD and is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the 
      presence of DM, and high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients 
      undergoing HD. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying 
      and the factors contributing to VC.

TI  - Aortic Calcification and Arterial Stiffness Burden in a Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Cohort with High Cardiovascular Risk: Baseline Characteristics of the Impact of 
      Phosphate Reduction On Vascular End-Points in Chronic Kidney Disease Trial.
PG  - 201-215
LID - 10.1159/000505717 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality compared to the general population. Hyperphosphataemia, associated with 
      vascular calcification and arterial stiffness, may play a key role in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with CKD, although phosphate 
      reduction strategies have not consistently proven to beneficially affect clinically 
      relevant outcomes. The IMpact of Phosphate Reduction On Vascular End-points in CKD 
      (IMPROVE-CKD) study is an international, multi-centre, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of the phosphate binder lanthanum 
      carbonate on intermediate cardiovascular markers in patients with stage 3b-4 CKD. 
      The primary end-point is change in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, 
      SphygmoCor) after 96 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC, computed tomography), serum phosphate and fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF-23). In total, 278 participants were recruited and randomized, mean 
      age 63 ± 13 years, 69% male, 45% diabetes, 32% CVD, 33% stage 3b CKD and 67% stage 4 
      CKD. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate were 26.6 ± 8.3 
      mL/min/1.72 m2 and 1.25 ± 0.20 mmol/L, respectively. Median (interquartile range) 
      intact and c-terminal FGF-23 levels were 133.0 (89.1-202) pg/mL and 221.1 
      (154.3-334.1) RU/mL, respectively. Mean PWV was 10.8 ± 3.6 m/s and 81% had AAC 
      (median Agatston score 1,535 [63-5,744] Hounsfield units). PWV ≥10 m/s was 
      associated with older age, diabetes, CVD, presence of AAC, higher systolic blood 
      pressure (BP), larger waist circumference and higher alkaline phosphatase. AAC was 
      associated with older age, male sex, diabetes, CVD, higher diastolic BP, 
      dyslipidaemia (and use of statins), smoking, larger waist circumference and 
      increased PWV. In conclusion, IMPROVE-CKD participants had high baseline risk for 
      cardiovascular events, as suggested by high baseline PWV and AAC values.

TI  - Protection Effect of Exogenous Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 on the Kidney Injury in 
      Vascular Calcification Rats.
PG  - 532-538
LID - 10.4103/0366-6999.226065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is closely related to the cardiovascular 
      events in vascular calcification (VC). However, little has known about the 
      characteristics of kidney injury caused by VC. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) 
      is an endocrine factor, which takes part in various metabolic actions with the 
      potential to alleviate metabolic disorder diseases. Even FGF21 has been regarded as 
      a biomarker in CKD, the role of FGF21 in CKD remains unclear. Therefore, in this 
      study, we evaluate the FGF21 on the kidney injury in VC rats. METHODS: The male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: (1) control group, (2) Vitamin 
      D3 plus nicotine (VDN)-induced VC group, (3) FGF21-treated VDN group. After 4 weeks, 
      the rats were killed and the blood was collected for serum creatinine, urea 
      nitrogen, calcium, and phosphate measurement. Moreover, the renal tissues were 
      homogenized for alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) activity and calcium content. The 
      levels of FGF21 protein were measured by radioimmunoassay. The levels of β-Klotho 
      and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA). The structural damage and calcifications in aortas were stained by 
      Alizarin-red S. Moreover, the structure of kidney was observed by hematoxylin and 
      eosin staining. RESULTS: The renal function impairment caused by VDN modeling was 
      ameliorated by FGF21 treatment, inhibited the elevated serum creatinine and urea 
      level by 20.5% (34.750 ± 4.334 μmol/L vs. 27.630 ± 2.387 μmol/L) and 4.0% (7.038 ± 
      0.590 mmol/L vs. 6.763 ± 0.374 mmol/L; P < 0.01), respectively, together with the 
      structural damages of glomerular atrophy and renal interstitial fibrosis. FGF21 
      treatment downregulated the ALP activity, calcium content in the kidney of VC rats 
      by 42.1% (P < 0.01) and 11.7% (P < 0.05) as well as ameliorated the aortic injury 
      and calcification as compared with VDN treatment alone group, indicating an 
      ameliorative effect on VC. ELISA assays showed that the expression of β-Klotho, a 
      component of FGF21 receptor system, was increased in VDN-treated VC rats by 37.4% 
      (6.588 ± 0.957 pg/mg vs. 9.054 ± 0.963 pg/mg; P < 0.01), indicating an 
      FGF21-resistant state. Moreover, FGF21 treatment downregulated the level of β-Klotho 
      in renal tissue by 16.7% (9.054 ± 0.963 pg/mg vs. 7.544 ± 1.362 pg/mg; P < 0.05). 
      However, the level of FGFR1, the receptor of FGF21, kept unchanged under VDN and VDN 
      plus FGF21 administration (0.191 ± 0.0376 ng/mg vs. 0.189 ± 0.032 ng/mg vs. 0.181 ± 
      0.034 ng/mg; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, FGF21 was observed to 
      ameliorate the kidney injury in VDN-induced VC rats. FGF21 might be a potential 
      therapeutic factor in CKD by cutting off the vicious circle between VC and kidney 
      injury.

TI  - Increased Peripheral Arterial Calcification in Patients Receiving Warfarin.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002665 [doi]
LID - e002665
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial 
      calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men is 
      unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral arteries was 
      compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This 
      retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 patients with radiographs performed 
      during or after warfarin therapy who were identified by a computerized search of 
      medical records. Each patient was matched to a patient without warfarin exposure 
      based on age, sex, and diabetes status. Patients with warfarin exposure <1 month, 
      history of end-stage renal disease, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
      Radiographs were reviewed visually for arterial calcification. The prevalence of 
      arterial calcification was 44% greater in patients with versus without warfarin use 
      (30.2% versus 20.9%, P=0.0023) but not on radiographs performed before warfarin 
      therapy (26.4% versus 22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years of warfarin therapy. The 
      increase was noted only in the ankle and foot, was limited to a medial pattern of 
      calcification, and was similar in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is 
      associated with lower extremity arterial calcification in both men and women 
      independent of age, sex, diabetes status, and other patient characteristics. This 
      may have implications for the choice of therapies for long-term anticoagulation.

TI  - Novel biological markers of bone: from bone metabolism to bone physiology.
PG  - 1714-25
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kev410 [doi]
AB  - Biochemical markers of bone turnover have been used for decades in the management of 
      bone diseases, to assess the prognosis of these conditions and to monitor 
      treatments. The new markers, however, also reflect specific physiological mechanisms 
      in the bone or other organs. Periostin may be more specific to the periosteum; 
      cathepsin K is an osteoclastic enzyme that may be involved in the cardiovascular 
      system and joints; Dickkopf-1 is involved in bone formation and vascular 
      calcification; sclerostin is a major regulator of bone formation in response to 
      mechanical loading and may also play a role in chronic kidney disease bone and 
      mineral disorder; sphingosine-1-phosphate is a lipid mediator interacting with bone 
      resorption. Some of the bone markers are in fact hormones produced by the bone that 
      affect various physiological and pathological functions in other organs. Thus, 
      osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts and participates in the regulation of insulin 
      sensitivity and fertility in men. Fibroblast growth factor 23 is produced by 
      osteocytes to regulate phosphorus and 1,25(OH)2D3, but it also plays a major role in 
      the adverse consequences of declining renal function, in particular with respect to 
      the myocardium. Micro RNAs are single-stranded RNAs that regulate several pathways, 
      including the development timing, organogenesis, cell apoptosis, proliferation and 
      differentiation. Their serum concentration may reflect the links between bone

TI  - Association of Serum Fetuin-A with Vascular Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients 
      and Its' Impact on 3-year Mortality.
PG  - 500-509
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is associated with increased intima- media thickness 
      (IMT) and vascular calcification (VC) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. 
      Fetuin-A is a serum protein, which inhibits vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the association between fetuin-A and VC, in a group of MHD 
      patients. METHODS: One hundred and forty-three MHD patients were included and 
      followed for 3 years. Blood samples were studied for calcification and inflammation 
      markers and fetuin-A was checked 3 times at the start, middle and the end of the 
      study. We used common carotid doppler sonography for assessment of indices of VC, 
      which were performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Vascular calcification 
      was defined as a common carotid intima media thickness ≥ 0.8 mm on either side or 
      the existence of any plaque or stenosis ≥ 50% on either side. RESULTS: From 143 
      patients (mean age 57.5 ± 15.9, 60.1% male), 104 patients (75.4%) had VC at 
      baseline. The mean age and the prevalence of DM were significantly higher in 
      patients with VC (P < .001 for both). There was no significant difference in the 
      levels of Pi, PTH, and fetuin-A between the two groups. In a multiple logistic 
      regression model at baseline only age (OR = 1.09, P < .001), and diabetes mellitus 
      (OR = 4.59, P < .05) were associated with VC and dialysis vintage had a marginal 
      association (OR = 1.20, P = .09). At the end of the study only age (OR = 1.12, P < 
      .001), and CRP (OR = 1.14, P < .05) were associated with VC. The mean survival of 
      patients with VC was significantly lower than the patients without VC (31.87 ± 0.95 
      vs. 33.73 ± 1.29, P < .05), however the mortality was not affected by fetuin-A 
      level. CONCLUSION: Survival rate of patients without VC was higher than the patients 
      with VC. We didn't find any correlation between the level of fetuin-A and VC. It 
      seems that the traditional risk factors of VC, including age and diabetes mellitus 
      are the main predictors of VC in MHD patients.

TI  - [Diabetic Kidney Disease 3rd stage - laboratory markers of mineral bone disorder].
PG  - 442-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney disease 
      in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic patients on 
      hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher prevalence of severe and 
      progressive vascular calcification with increased cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. The main factor which causes vascular calcification in patients with 
      diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic control. The recent trial findings 
      describe an inverse correlation between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum 
      levels and glycemic control in a group of diabetic patients on hemodialysis. AIM: 
      The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the laboratory 
      markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on glycemic 
      control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic compensation of 
      diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Ninety one patients with 
      3rd stage DKD were investigated. There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), 
      average age of patients was 71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l 
      and estimated glomerular filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 
      patients with better glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with 
      poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. 
      Patients were further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH 
      (iPTH < 35 pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis 
      was performed using and Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We have found the statistical 
      significance in the serum phosphate and proteinuria levels in between groups with 
      HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 %. Diabetics with better glycemic control had 
      significant reduction in serum phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p 
      = 0.038) and in 24 hrs proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 
      0.007). In the group of presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found 
      the trend towards increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.063) and increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control of 
      diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD. KEY WORDS: diabetes 
      mellitus type 2 (DM2T) - chronic kidney disease (CKD) - mineral and bone disorder 
      (MBD).

TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1543-3 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from 
      cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play 
      a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify 
      CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe 
      hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 
      2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and 
      clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were 
      analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 
      patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 
      AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of 
      patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In 
      univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total 
      cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely 
      correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In 
      multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that 
      CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral 
      neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with 
      Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus 
      integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a potential 
      contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), which 
      has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular calcification. The 
      positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density (BMD) has been 
      demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between sclerostin and BMD in PD 
      patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were enrolled; their sera were collected 
      for measurement of sclerostin and other CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also 
      assessed simultaneously. We examined the relationship between sclerostin and each 
      parameter through Spearman correlation analysis and by comparing group data between 
      patients with above- and below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and multiple 
      logistic regression models were employed to define the most predictive of sclerostin 
      levels in the above-median category. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that 
      sclerostin was correlated with spine BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score 
      (r = 0.274, P = 0.010), spine BMD Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH; r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. 
      High BMD, old age, male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high 
      osteocalcin and uric acid levels were observed in patients with high serum 
      sclerostin levels and an inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin. 
      Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively 
      correlated with above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P = 0.002); 
      the correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 121.5, 
      P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a positive 
      association between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD population.

PG  - 262-8
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2014.00250 [doi]
AB  - ♦ BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is strongly associated with cardiovascular 
      disease and mortality. However, some factors related to vascular calcification in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain 
      unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of osteoprotegerin (OPG), 
      osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), 
      magnesium, and phosphate clearance with vascular calcification in PD subjects, 
      assessed by plain radiographs. ♦ METHODS: Simple vascular calcification scores 
      (SVCS) obtained from plain X-rays of the pelvis and hands, and the Kauppila Index 
      (KI) from lateral lumbar X-rays were assessed in 76 adults receiving PD for ≥ 6 
      months (43 women, median age 39 years, median time on PD 1.4 years). Levels of OPG, 
      OPN, OCN, and FGF-23 were determined by luminometry. ♦ RESULTS: Serum OPG levels 
      were higher in subjects with vascular calcification (n = 22 with SVCS > 3; n = 19 
      with KI > 7) compared with those with less calcification (p < 0.001). Spearman's 
      correlation coefficients between OPG and SVCS and KI were r = 0.49 and r = 0.51, 
      respectively (both p < 0.001). Subjects with vascular calcification had 
      significantly lower renal phosphate clearance. Multiple regression analysis showed 
      that vascular calcification assessed by SVCS was associated with age (r = 0.2, p = 
      0.042), diabetes mellitus (r = 2.4, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.09, p = 
      0.037), and OPG (r = 0.22, p = 0.001). Vascular calcification assessed by KI was 
      associated with age (r = 0.16, p < 0.001), time on PD (r = 0.54, p = 0.001) and OPG 
      (r = 0.08, p = 0.04). Osteocalcin, OPN, FGF-23, and magnesium were not associated 
      with vascular calcification. ♦ CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of OPG were consistently 
      associated with vascular calcification in subjects on PD.

TI  - FGF-23 and the progression of coronary arterial calcification in patients new to 
      dialysis.
PG  - 2017-22
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02160212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a regulator of 
      phosphorus metabolism, is a risk marker in CKD. FGF-23 has been associated with 
      coronary arterial calcification (CAC), but it is not known whether FGF-23 predicts 
      CAC progression in CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of 
      FGF-23 with CAC progression in advanced CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: FGF-23 levels and CAC were measured by electrocardiography-triggered 
      multislice computed tomography in 99 individuals initiating dialysis. Patients were 
      enrolled in the study from April 2008 to July 2010. CAC was calculated using 
      Agatston and calcium volume score. Sixty-seven study participants had repeat CAC 
      measures at 1 year. Linear regression was used to assess the association of FGF-23 
      with CAC. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 50 years; 33% were women, 
      and 64% were black. The median FGF-23 level was 1238 relative units (RU)/ml 
      (interquartile range, 515-2218 RU/ml). According to Agatston score, FGF-23 was not 
      associated with baseline CAC (P=0.14) but was significantly associated with CAC 
      progression. There was a 192.3-Agatston unit change in CAC score per 1-SD change in 
      FGF-23 (P=0.008) in models adjusting for known risk factors for CAC and serum 
      phosphate. This association persisted after adjustment for high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein, 25-OH vitamin D levels, and the use of phosphorus binders. 
      Results were similar when change in calcium volume score was used. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      individuals with advanced CKD, serum FGF-23 is strongly associated with CAC 
      progression. FGF-23 may be a marker of cardiovascular risk in CKD.

TI  - Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 Is Associated With Carotid Plaque Presence and Area: The 
      Northern Manhattan Study.
PG  - 2048-53
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.305945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone that regulates 
      phosphate homeostasis, has been associated with mortality, cardiovascular events, 
      and stroke, and to arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease, but its role in 
      atherosclerosis is unclear and population-based studies are lacking. We hypothesized 
      that elevated FGF23 would associate with carotid plaque presence, area, and 
      echogenicity in the race/ethnically diverse community-based Northern Manhattan Study 
      (NOMAS) sample. APPROACH AND RESULTS: There were 1512 stroke-free NOMAS participants 
      with FGF23 and 2-dimensional carotid ultrasound data (mean age, 68±9 years; 61% 
      women; 62% Hispanic, 18% black, and 18% white). We used multivariable linear and 
      logistic regression to evaluate FGF23, continuously and by quintiles, as a correlate 
      of carotid plaque, plaque area (cubic root transformed), and echogenicity adjusting 
      for sociodemographic and vascular risk factors. Participants with FGF23 levels in 
      the top quintile were more likely to have carotid plaque (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.02-2.19; P=0.04) and larger plaque area (β=0.32 mm(2), 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.10-0.53 mm(2); P=0.004) than those in the lowest quintile, 
      adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate, demographics, and vascular risk 
      factors. Linear regression models also showed that log transformed FGF23 (LnFGF23) 
      associated with greater odds of plaque presence (odds ratio, 1.26 per LnFGF23; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.01-1.58; P=0.04), and plaque area (β=0.19 mm(2) per LnFGF23; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.31 mm(2); P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Higher FGF23 
      associated with greater likelihood and burden of carotid atherosclerosis independent 
      of CKD. Atherosclerosis may be a mechanism through which FGF23 increases 
      cardiovascular events and stroke.

TI  - Outcome predictability of serum alkaline phosphatase in men with pre-dialysis CKD.
PG  - 3003-11
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and high-turnover bone disease. ALP may represent an adjunct 
      marker of high bone turnover devoid of drawbacks of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 
      and it may also be associated with cardiovascular calcification in CKD. Higher ALP 
      has been recently associated with increased mortality and coronary calcification in 
      dialysis patients. In pre-dialysis CKD patients, this association is not clear. 
      METHODS: We examined the association of baseline, time-varying and time-averaged ALP 
      with all-cause mortality and the composite of pre-dialysis mortality or end-stage 
      renal disease in a historical prospective cohort of 1158 male veterans with 
      pre-dialysis CKD from a single institution by using multivariable-adjusted Cox 
      models. RESULTS: Higher ALP was associated with increased mortality irrespective of 
      the statistical model. Time-averaged ALP displayed a consistent linear association 
      with mortality: a 50-U/L higher serum ALP was associated with a 
      multivariable-adjusted death hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.17 
      (1.08-1.28), P < 0.001. Baseline and time-varying ALP showed non-linear associations 
      with mortality, with serum levels above 70 U/L in all models and with lower levels 
      in time-varying models. Associations between ALP levels and the composite outcomes 
      were similar. However, compared to serum PTH, mortality predictability of ALP 
      appeared more incremental. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ALP is associated with increased 
      mortality in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. Low ALP appears to be associated with 
      short-term mortality.

TI  - Serum osteoprotegerin is an independent marker of central arterial stiffness as 
      assessed using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity in hemodialysis patients: a cross 
      sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link 
      between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD 
      patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured 
      using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define 
      the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into 
      tertiles. RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high 
      arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure 
      (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
      (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV 
      value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing 
      tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, 
      respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum 
      calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; 
      OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with 
      cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). 
      CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have 
      greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

TI  - Impact of altered dietary calcium-phosphorus ratio caused by high-phosphorus diets 
      in a rat chronic kidney disease (CKD) model created by partial ligation of the renal 
      arteries.
PG  - 77-86
LID - 10.1293/tox.2019-0086 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to establish a rat chronic kidney disease (CKD) model by studying 
      the effects of a high-phosphorus diet in rats that had undergone partial ligation of 
      the renal arteries (RL). Separate groups of 10-week-old male Slc:Sprague-Dawley rats 
      underwent RL and were fed diets with varying phosphorous levels for a period of 48 
      days. A marked suppression of body weight gain necessitating humane euthanization 
      occurred on day 28 in rats that had undergone RL and were given high-phosphorus 
      feed. By contrast, the group of intact animals on a high-phosphorus feed exhibited a 
      slightly decreased body weight gain from day 21 and survived until scheduled 
      euthanization. In rats with RL, hematological, blood biochemical, and 
      histopathological analyses demonstrated the presence of CKD-like conditions, 
      particularly in the group that were fed a high-phosphorus diet. Hyperphosphatemia 
      and hypocalcemia were induced by a high-phosphorus diet in both the RL and intact 
      groups, both of which had high levels of FGF23 and parathyroid hormone in the blood. 
      Rats with RL on a high-phosphorus diet showed decreased hematopoiesis by the 
      hematopoietic cell area being narrower in the medullary cavity, proliferation of 
      mesenchymal cells and osteoblasts/osteoclasts, and expansion of the osteoid area, a 
      furthermore generalized vascular lesions, such as calcification, were observed. 
      These findings demonstrate that the partial ligation of the renal arteries combined 
      with a calcium-phosphorus imbalance induced by a high-phosphorus diet serves as an 
      animal model for CKD-like conditions accompanied by bone lesions, helping to 
      elucidate this clinical condition and its underlying molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Etelcalcetide, A Novel Calcimimetic, Prevents Vascular Calcification in A Rat Model 
      of Renal Insufficiency with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 641-653
LID - 10.1007/s00223-017-0319-7 [doi]
AB  - Etelcalcetide, a novel peptide agonist of the calcium-sensing receptor, prevents 
      vascular calcification in a rat model of renal insufficiency with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism. Vascular calcification occurs frequently in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a consequence of impaired mineral homeostasis 
      and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Etelcalcetide substantially lowers 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) levels in SHPT 
      patients on hemodialysis. This study compared the effects of etelcalcetide and 
      paricalcitol on vascular calcification in rats with adenine-induced CKD and SHPT. 
      Uremia and SHPT were induced in male Wistar rats fed a diet supplemented with 0.75% 
      adenine for 4 weeks. Rats were injected with vehicle, etelcalcetide, or paricalcitol 
      for 4 weeks from the beginning of adenine diet. Rats fed an adenine-free diet were 
      included as nonuremic controls. Similar reductions in plasma PTH and parathyroid 
      chief cell proliferation were observed in both etelcalcetide- and 
      paricalcitol-treated rats. Serum calcium and phosphorus were significantly lower in 
      etelcalcetide-treated uremic rats and was unchanged in paricalcitol-treated rats. 
      Both serum FGF23 and aortic calcium content were significantly lower in 
      etelcalcetide-treated uremic rats compared with either vehicle- or 
      paricalcitol-treated uremic rats. The degree of aortic calcium content for 
      etelcalcetide-treated rats was similar to that in nonuremic controls and 
      corroborated findings of lack of histologic aortic mineralization in those groups. 
      In conclusion, etelcalcetide and paricalcitol similarly attenuated progression of 
      SHPT in an adenine rat model of CKD. However, etelcalcetide differentially prevented 
      vascular calcification, at least in part, due to reductions in serum FGF23, calcium, 
      and phosphorus levels.

TI  - Calciphylaxis: An Analysis of Concomitant Factors, Treatment Effectiveness and 
      Prognosis in 30 Patients.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.2147/IJNRD.S241422 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare but severe complication mostly affecting 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with high morbidity 
      and mortality. The natural history, concomitant factors, pathogenesis, and treatment 
      for calciphylaxis remain equivocal. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on 
      patients diagnosed with calciphylaxis in a tertiary care center between January 1, 
      2012, and December 31, 2017. We describe demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory 
      parameters, effectiveness of sodium thiosulfate treatment and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 
      the 30 patients (age 65.6 ± 12.79 years, male:female = 8:22), 23 (76.67%) had ESRD 
      and were either on hemodialysis (15 [65.22%], median duration 22.5 months [range 
      0.2-96 months]) or peritoneal dialysis (8 [34.78%], duration 29±10 months). 
      Predisposing home medications: 8 (28%) had calcium supplements, 10 (36%) had 
      warfarin, 16 (57%) had vitamin D and 5 (18%) had iron supplements. The median 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 239.8 pg/mL (range 4.7-2922). Calciphylaxis was 
      found on extremities in 21 (70%) and on torso in 6 (20%) patients. Sodium 
      thiosulfate (STS) was given for treatment in 20 (67%) patients and 3 were cured in 
      <2.25 months. One-year survival for all patients with calciphylaxis was 26% (29% for 
      STS group and 20% for those that did not receive STS) and following any surgical 
      treatment regardless of STS use was 14%. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, absence 
      of a control group and low power. CONCLUSION: Calciphylaxis was more common among 
      females with a predilection for extremities over the torso. Elevations in PTH and 
      inflammatory markers were common. Treatment with STS did not show a statistically 
      significant improvement in survival. Those who were cured, were treated with STS up 
      to three months.

TI  - Effect of essential amino acid кetoanalogues and protein restriction diet on 
      morphogenetic proteins (FGF-23 and Кlotho) in 3b-4 stages chronic кidney disease 
      patients: a randomized pilot study.
PG  - 1351-1359
LID - 10.1007/s10157-018-1591-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low protein diet (LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue 
      supplementation (KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      while the exact mechanisms of KA's effect are not established yet. We have conducted 
      a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of LPD + KA and LPD alone in 
      relation to serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels in CKD patients. METHODS: 79 non-diabetic 
      CKD 3b-4 stage patients, compliant with LPD diet (0.6 g/kg of body weight/day), had 
      been selected. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group (42 
      patients) received LPD + КA. The second group (37 patients) continued the LРD alone. 
      In addition to routine tests, serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels, as well as bioimpedance 
      analysis, sphygmography (stiffness (augmentation) indices (AI), central (aortal) 
      blood pressure) with a «SphygmaCor» device; echocardiography (valvular calcification 
      score (VCS) and LVMMI), were performed. RESULTS: There were body mass indices' 
      decrease (p = 0.046), including muscle body mass in men (p = 0.027) and woman 
      (p = 0.044) in the LPD group to the end of study (14th month). In addition, lower 
      FGF-23 (p = 0.029), and higher sKlotho (p = 0.037) were detected in the LPD + KA 
      group compared to the LPD one. The increase in AI (p = 0.034), VCS (p = 0.048), and 
      LVMMI (p = 0.023) was detected more often in the LPD group at the end of study. 
      CONCLUSION: LPD + KA provides support for nutrition status and contributes to more 
      efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities that may result in 
      cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD. At the same 
      time, a prolonged LPD alone may lead to malnutrition.

LID - AOP_13_014 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial thickening contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk in 
      patients on maintenance renal replacement therapy. The common carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) is an early atherosclerotic marker and may be used 
      to assess the stratification of atherosclerotic advancement and resultant arterial 
      calcification. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations 
      between atherosclerotic changes in the common carotid arteries expressed as the 
      CCA-IMT and the body mass index (BMI), serum lipid levels, C‑reactive protein (CRP), 
      and selected bone metabolism parameters including phosphorus, calcium, intact 
      parathormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, 
      osteocalcin, fetuin A, and fibroblast growth factor‑23 (FGF‑23) in patients treated 
      with peritoneal dialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 67 patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (36 men and 31 women) aged 53 ±13 years (range, 19-75 years) 
      treated with peritoneal dialysis for 30 ±24 months. The CCA‑IMT was assessed by 
      ultrasonography using Acuson 128/10 XP. The BMI was calculated using the Quetelet 
      formula. Serum lipid levels, phosphorus, calcium, iPTH, alkaline phosphatase, and 
      CRP were measured using standard laboratory methods, while fetuin A, osteocalcin, 
      osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, and FGF‑23 using commercial enzyme‑linked 
      immunosorbent assay kits. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed between 
      CCA-IMT and age (r = 0.54, P <0.0001), BMI (r = 0.39, P = 0.003), and 
      osteoprotegerin (r = 0.38, P = 0.004). In a multiple regression analysis, age (r = 
      0.41, P = 0.01), osteocalcin (r = 0.34, P = 0.04), and log‑transformed 
      osteoprotegerin values (r = 0.38, P = 0.02) remained independently associated with 
      the CCA-IMT. The highest CCA‑IMT values (0.85 ±0.21) were observed in patients with 
      osteoprotegerin concentrations in the upper tertile. Osteoprotegerin concentrations 
      strongly and positively correlated with the duration of dialysis treatment (r = 
      0.55, P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The CCA‑IMT has been shown to be a reliable 
      noninvasive measure of subclinical atherosclerosis and, therefore, of associated 
      increased vascular risk. Elevated serum osteoprotegerin levels may be useful as a 
      prognostic marker of cardiovascular risk in dialyzed patients.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast 
      activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent data indicate 
      that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet 
      receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was 
      assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to 
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin 
      levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
      determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. 
      Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) 
      (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of 
      AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin 
      levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher 
      body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower 
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In 
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history 
      (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
      determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that 
      patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
      multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
      experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
      protects against progression of vascular calcification.

TI  - Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by-stander, 
      but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in 
      vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline 
      phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
      RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
      were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
      phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with 
      older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher 
      serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone 
      levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but 
      the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate 
      time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of serum alkaline 
      phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone 
      metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase 
      was significantly associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 
      95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 
      1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in 
      hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. 
      Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Associations of Serum Calciprotein Particle Size and Transformation Time With 
      Arterial Calcification, Arterial Stiffness, and Mortality in Incident Hemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 346-354
LID - S0272-6386(20)30889-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.05.031 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of the transformation of primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles (CPPs) in serum, including the size of secondary CPP (CPP2) 
      aggregates and the time of transformation (T(50)), may be markers for arterial 
      calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We examined the associations 
      of CPP2 aggregate size and T(50) with arterial calcification in incident HD 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident 
      HD patients (n=402with available CPP2 measures and n=388with available T(50) 
      measures) from the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End-Stage 
      Renal Disease (PACE) Study PREDICTORS: Serum CPP2 size and T(50) at baseline. 
      OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were baseline coronary artery and thoracic aorta 
      calcifications. Exploratory outcomes included baseline arterial stiffness, measured 
      by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ankle brachial index, and longitudinally, repeat 
      measures of PWV and all-cause mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Tobit regression, 
      multiple linear regression, Poisson regression, linear mixed-effects regression, and 
      Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 55±13 years, 41% were 
      women, 71% were Black, and 57% had diabetes mellitus. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) 
      were correlated with baseline fetuin A level (r=-0.59 for CPP2 and 0.44 for T(50); 
      P<0.001 for both), but neither was associated with baseline measures of arterial 
      calcification or arterial stiffness. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) were not 
      associated with repeat measures of PWV. During a median follow-up of 3.5 (IQR, 
      1.7-6.2) years, larger CPP2 was associated with higher risk for mortality (HR, 1.17 
      [95% CI, 1.05-1.31] per 100nm larger CPP2 size) after adjusting for demographics and 
      comorbid conditions, but there was no association between baseline T(50) and risk 
      for mortality. LIMITATIONS: Possible imprecision in assays, small sample size, 
      limited generalizability to incident HD populations with different racial 
      composition, and residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In incident HD patients, neither 
      CPP2 size nor T(50) was associated with prevalent arterial calcification and 
      stiffness. Larger CPP2 was associated with risk for mortality, but this finding 
      needs to be confirmed in future studies.

TI  - The Preventive Effects of Xanthohumol on Vascular Calcification Induced by Vitamin 
      D(3) Plus Nicotine.
LID - 10.3390/antiox9100956 [doi]
LID - 956
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in patients with atherosclerosis, 
      chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. In blood vessels, VC is 
      associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. Xanthohumol (XN), a main 
      prenylated chalcone found in hops, has antioxidant effects to inhibit VC. This study 
      aimed to investigate whether XN attenuates VC through in vivo study. A rat VC model 
      was established by four weeks oral administration of vitamin D(3) plus nicotine in 
      Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In brief, 30 male SD rats were randomly divided into three 
      groups: control, 25 mg/kg nicotine in 5 mL corn oil and 3 × 10(5) IU/kg vitamin D(3) 
      administration (VDN), and combination of VDN with 20 mg/L in 0.1% ethanol of XN 
      (treatment group). Physiological variables such as body and heart weight and 
      drinking consumption were weekly observed, and treatment with XN caused no 
      differences among the groups. In comparison with the control group, calcium content 
      and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were increased in calcified arteries, and XN 
      treatment reduced these levels. Dihydroethidium (DHE) and 2',7'-dichloroflurescin 
      diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining to identify Superoxide and reactive oxygen species 
      generation from aorta tissue showed increased production in VDN group compared with 
      the control and treatment groups. Hematoxylin eosin (HE) and Alizarin Red S staining 
      were determined to show medial vascular thickness and calcification of vessel wall. 
      Administration of VDN resulted in VC, and XN treatment showed improvement in 
      vascular structure. Moreover, overexpression of osteogenic transcription factors 
      bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) 
      were significantly suppressed by XN treatment in VC. Moreover, downregulation of 
      vascular phenotypic markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and smooth muscle 22 
      alpha (SM22α) were increased by XN treatment in VC. Furthermore, XN treatment in VC 
      upregulated nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and 
      heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expressions. Otherwise, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 
      (Keap1) was alleviated by XN treatment in VC. In conclusion, our findings suggested 
      that XN enhances antioxidant capacity to improve VC by regulating the 
      Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 pathway. Therefore, XN may have potential effects to decrease 
      cardiovascular risk by reducing VC.

TI  - Risk factors associated with aortic calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 347-352
LID - 10.22088/cjim.9.4.347 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are some uncertainties among the risk factors of vascular 
      calcification in the hemodialysis patients. This study was planned to examine the 
      association between abdominal aortic calcification and concerned biochemical 
      parameters in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this cross- sectional study, 84 
      stable hemodialysis patients admitted on hemodialysis section of Shahid Beheshti 
      Hospital in 2013 were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Pre-dialysis venous 
      blood samples were taken from patients to determine the amount of intact parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase (Alk.P), C - reactive protein (CRP), calcium 
      (Ca) and phosphorus (P). Patients underwent abdominal CT scanning and ACI (ACI) was 
      calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. Chi-square, 
      Kruskal Wallis and One Way ANOVA tests were used. P-values < 0.05 were considered 
      significant. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 50.15±17.03 years (18-83 
      y/o).A statistically significant correlation was observed between ACI and ALK-P 
      serum levels (p=0.01). It was found that ACI had a significant relationship with 
      phosphorus in women (p=0.01). ALK-P serum levels in men also had a significant 
      relationship with ACI (p=0.02). In addition, there was a significant correlation 
      between ACI and history of cerebro-cardiovascular disease and also duration of 
      dialysis (p=0.004 and 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with longer 
      duration of dialysis, and patients with a history of cardiovascular and 
      cerebrovascular events, ACI levels were significantly higher. ALK-P and phosphorus 
      were correlated with aortic calcification in males and females respectively. No 
      significant correlation was found between iPTH serum levels and aortic 
      calcification.

TI  - A case-control study of calciphylaxis in Japanese end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 1580-4
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr658 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and 
      often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is characterized by painful 
      skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification and intimal proliferation of small 
      arteries. Studies in western countries have reported incidences ranging from 1 to 4% 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients. Since no systematic studies of calciphylaxis have 
      ever been performed in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey and a case-control 
      study to identify the characteristics of calciphylaxis in the Japanese dialysis 
      population. METHODS: Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760 hemodialysis centers 
      in Japan, asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been encountered in the past, and 
      detailed clinical data regarding each case were then collected from the centers. In 
      addition, two control dialysis patients matched for age and duration of hemodialysis 
      to each calciphylaxis case were identified at the participating centers, and their 
      data were analyzed to identify risk factors for calciphylaxis. RESULTS: Responses to 
      the questionnaire were obtained from 1838 centers (48.3%), and 151 centers reported 
      that a total of 249 cases had been encountered. Sixty-four centers agreed to 
      participate in the case-control study, and detailed clinical data in regard to 67 
      cases were obtained. In 28 of the 67 cases, a definite diagnosis of calciphylaxis 
      was made by our study group based on the clinical characteristics and skin biopsy 
      findings. A univariate logistic regression model comparing them with 56-matched 
      controls identified warfarin therapy [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI)] 2.7-48.1, P=0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR 19.8, 95% 
      CI 4.4-89.5, P=0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma glucose level (OR 3.74, 
      95% CI 1.08-12.9, P=0.037) and each 1 mg/dL increment in adjusted serum calcium 
      level (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.63-6.30, P=0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly 
      associated with calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with 
      female gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted 
      calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin therapy and 
      lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk factors after a multivariate 
      logistic regression model analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed 
      that warfarin therapy and lower serum albumin levels are significant and strong risk 
      factors for the development of calciphylaxis in chronic hemodialysis patients in 
      Japan.

TI  - The relationship between poor nutritional status and progression of aortic 
      calcification in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/s12882-018-0872-y [doi]
LID - 71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on 
      prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification 
      progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients 
      on HD. METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. 
      Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular 
      blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was 
      evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment 
      ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI 
      values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified 
      into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) 
      and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, 
      comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between 
      ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI 
      progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, 
      respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 
      year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. 
      The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 
      (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic 
      nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were 
      male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the 
      progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to 
      improve progression of aortic calcification in patients on HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Vitamin D and Abdominal Aortic Calcification in Older African American Women, the 
      PODA Clinical Trial.

AB  - Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) detected on lateral vertebral fracture 
      assessment is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin D deficiency 
      and toxicity have been linked with vascular calcification. The objective of this 
      study was to determine the effect of high-dose vitamin D on the progression of AAC. 
      The Physical Performance, Osteoporosis and vitamin D in African American Women 
      (PODA) is a randomized, clinical trial examining the effect of vitamin D. There were 
      14.7% subjects with AAC in the vitamin D group, compared to 12.1% in the placebo 
      group at baseline. The prevalence of extended AAC at baseline was 6.4% in the 
      vitamin D group and 3.5% in the placebo group. The extended calcification scores 
      over time were not different between groups. There was no association between AAC 
      and serum 25(OH)D. However, PTH was associated with an increase in AAC in the 
      placebo group.

AB  - Pulse pressure (PP) reflects increased large artery stiffness, which is caused, in 
      part, by arterial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. PP has been 
      shown to predict both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in various patient 
      populations, including kidney transplant (KTX) recipients. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is 
      a marker and regulator of arterial calcification, and it is related to 
      cardiovascular survival in hemodialysis patients. Here we tested the hypothesis that 
      OPG is associated with increased pulse pressure. We cross-sectionally analyzed the 
      association between serum OPG and PP in a prevalent cohort of 969 KTX patients (mean 
      age: 51 +/- --13 years, 57% male, 21% diabetics, mean eGFR 51 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 
      m2). Independent associations were tested in a linear regression model adjusted for 
      multiple covariables. PP was positively correlated with serum OPG (rho = 0.284, p < 
      0.001). Additionally, a positive correlation was seen between PP versus age (r = 
      0.358, p < 0.001), the Charlson Comorbidity Index (r = 0.232, p < 0.001), serum 
      glucose (r = 0.172, p < 0.001), BMI (r = 0.133, p = 0.001) and serum cholesterol (r 
      = 0.094, p = 0.003). PP was negatively correlated with serum Ca, albumin and eGFR. 
      The association between PP and OPG remained significant after adjusting for multiple 
      potentially relevant covariables (beta = 0.143, p < 0.001). We conclude that serum 
      OPG is independently associated with pulse pressure in kidney transplant recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors 
      such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K 
      insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) 
      years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation. FACTOR: 
      Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K 
      status. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant failure. RESULTS: At inclusion, 
      median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients 
      having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median 
      follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) 
      developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at 
      considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile 
      (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). 
      After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion 
      of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained 
      significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing 
      transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs 
      Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney 
      function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7). 
      LIMITATIONS: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No 
      data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, 
      is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated 
      independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address 
      whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem 
      in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular 
      calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate 
      human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. 
      HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels of inorganic phosphate 
      (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in media containing 
      phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 
      mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies 
      showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the 
      osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of 
      elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate 
      cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor 
      phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium 
      deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was 
      identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that 
      elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that 
      predispose to calcification and offers a novel explanation of the phenomenon of 
      vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined 
      the factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic 
      hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular 
      calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the significant factors 
      affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, 
      increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic 
      pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly 
      stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and 
      offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
      hyperphosphatemic conditions.

TI  - Increased vascular calcification in patients receiving warfarin.
PG  - 237-42
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304392 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Matrix gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of medial arterial 
      calcification whose synthesis and activity are blocked by warfarin. Warfarin induces 
      arterial calcification in experimental models, but whether this occurs in humans is 
      unclear. This was addressed by examining breast arterial calcification, which is 
      exclusively medial and easily identified on mammograms. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 
      Screening mammograms from women with current, past, or future warfarin use were 
      examined for the presence of arterial calcification and compared with mammograms 
      obtained in untreated women matched for age and diabetes mellitus. Women with a 
      serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or a history of end-stage renal disease were excluded. 
      In 451 women with mammograms performed after ≥1 month of warfarin therapy, the 
      prevalence of arterial calcification was 50% greater than in 451 untreated women 
      (39.0% versus 25.9%; P<0.0001). However, in 159 mammograms performed before warfarin 
      therapy, the prevalence of arterial calcification was not increased (26.4% versus 
      25.8%). The increased prevalence varied with duration of treatment, from 25.0% for 
      <1 year to 74.4% for >5 years. In a multivariable logistic model, only age and 
      duration of warfarin, but not the period of time after stopping warfarin, were 
      significant determinants of arterial calcification in women with current or past 
      warfarin use. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of breast arterial calcification is 
      increased in women with current or past warfarin use independent of other risk 
      factors and conditions predating warfarin use. This effect appears to be cumulative 
      and may be irreversible.

TI  - Fetuin-A and kidney function in persons with coronary artery disease--data from the 
      Heart and Soul Study.
PG  - 2144-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a serum protein that inhibits ectopic vascular calcification 
      and is present in lower concentrations in end-stage renal disease than in healthy 
      controls. Whether fetuin-A concentrations are also lower in the setting of 
      mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the 
      associations of several parameters of kidney function including measured 24 h 
      urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl), estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 
      the Mayo Clinic quadratic GFR equation (qGFR), serum cystatin-C concentrations, and 
      urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio with serum fetuin-A concentrations in 970 
      outpatients with coronary artery disease. We used general linear models to determine 
      the adjusted mean fetuin-A concentrations within each kidney function category. 
      RESULTS: The mean age of the study sample was 67 years, 82% were male, 71% had 
      hypertension and 26% had diabetes mellitus. In adjusted analysis, we observed no 
      significant differences in mean fetuin-A concentrations across groups defined by 
      CrCl, qGFR, or albumin-to-creatinine ratio groups. For example, adjusted mean 
      fetuin-A concentrations were 0.66 g/l in participants with CrCl > 90, 60-90 and 
      45-60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and 0.65 g/l in participants with CrCl < 45 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2). Higher serum cystatin-C (indicating worse kidney function) was associated with 
      higher adjusted mean serum fetuin-A concentrations (lowest quartile 0.62 g/l, 
      highest quartile 0.68 g/l; P for trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Among ambulatory 
      patients with coronary artery disease, there is no evidence that mild-to-moderate 
      CKD is associated with lower concentrations of serum fetuin-A compared with persons 
      with normal renal function. The mechanisms explaining the association between CKD 
      and vascular calcification remain elusive.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease results in deficiency of ABCC6, the novel inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification.
PG  - 51-5
LID - 10.1159/000365014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with arterial medial 
      calcification which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease 
      in this population. Several factors are known to promote soft tissue and accelerated 
      arterial calcification in CKD including systemic inflammation, altered calcium and 
      phosphate homeostasis, hypertension, and deficiency of endogenous calcification 
      inhibitors. The ABCC6 transporter (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C number 6), also 
      known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6), is highly expressed in 
      the liver and kidney. Mutation of ABCC6 results in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an 
      inherited disorder characterized by arterial and soft tissue calcification. Given 
      the prevalence of arterial medial calcification in CKD, the present study was 
      undertaken to test the hypothesis that CKD may lead to acquired ABCC6 deficiency. 
      METHODS: CKD was induced via 5/6 nephrectomy in male Sprague-Dawley rats and by 
      adenine-containing diet to cause chronic interstitial nephropathy in female DBA/2J 
      mice. Sham-operated rats and mice fed regular diet served as controls. Liver and 
      kidney tissues were harvested and processed for ABCC6 protein and mRNA analysis. 
      RESULTS: ABCC6 protein levels were significantly reduced in the liver and kidney 
      tissues from CKD rats and mice. However, ABCC6 mRNA levels were unchanged, pointing 
      to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms for the observed ABCC6 
      deficiency. Additionally, plasma levels of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A were 
      significantly decreased in CKD animals compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: CKD 
      results in acquired ABCC6 transporter deficiency. To our knowledge this abnormality 
      has not been previously reported and may contribute to CKD-associated vascular and 
      soft tissue calcification.

TI  - Breast arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease: absence of smooth muscle 
      apoptosis and osteogenic transdifferentiation.
PG  - 668-76
LID - 10.1038/ki.2013.351 [doi]
AB  - The pathophysiology of medial arterial calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      is unclear but has been ascribed to phenotypic changes in vascular smooth muscle, 
      possibly in conjunction with intimal proliferation and atherosclerosis. As the 
      prevalence of calcification in breast arteries is increased in women with CKD and 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD), this was examined histologically in mastectomy 
      specimens from 19 women with CKD or ESRD. Arterial calcification was present in 18, 
      was exclusively medial, and occurred in vessels as small as arterioles. Intimal 
      thickening was common but unrelated to calcification. There was no evidence of 
      atherosclerosis. The earliest calcification presented as small punctate lesions 
      scattered throughout the media, often with calcification of the internal elastic 
      lamina. Arterial calcification was present in all samples from an age- and 
      diabetes-matched cohort without CKD but was much milder. While smooth muscle cell 
      density was reduced one-third in arteries from patients with ESRD, the cells 
      appeared normal, expressed SM22α, and exhibited no apoptosis. Staining for the 
      bone-specific protein osteocalcin, the osteoblastic transcription factors Runx2 or 
      osterix, or the chondrocytic transcription factor SOX9 was absent in regions of 
      early calcification. Thus, medial calcification in breast arteries of patients with 
      CKD can occur in the absence of smooth muscle cell apoptosis and/or osteogenic 
      transdifferentiation. This suggests that the pathologic mineralization process may 
      differ from one arterial type to the other.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque identification 
      using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of 
      atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might 
      be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured 
      using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode 
      Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 
      63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are 
      on HD thrice a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing 
      tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, 
      P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than 
      patients free of plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant 
      correlation was recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In 
      multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant 
      independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify 
      whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for 
      atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - Role of fibroblast growth factor-23 in peripheral vascular calcification in 
      non-diabetic and diabetic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1506-13
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a recently identified circulating 
      factor that regulates phosphate (Pi) metabolism. Since the derangement of Pi control 
      is an important risk factor for vascular calcification, we investigated the 
      importance of plasma FGF-23 in the development of vascular calcification in the 
      aorta and peripheral artery in hemodialysis patients with and without diabetes 
      mellitus (DM). METHODS: Male hemodialysis patients with DM (n=32) and without DM 
      (n=56) were examined. Plasma samples were obtained before the start of dialysis 
      sessions, and the FGF-23 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. Roentgenography of the aorta and hand artery was performed, and visible 
      vascular calcification was evaluated by one examiner, who was blinded to the patient 
      characteristics. RESULTS: In the 56 non-DM hemodialysis patients, vascular 
      calcification was found in the hand artery in 5 patients (8.9%) and in the aorta in 
      23 patients (41.1%). These levels were significantly lower (p<0.05) than in the 32 
      DM patients, of whom, 19 (59.4%) and 21 (65.6%) had vascular calcification of the 
      hand artery and aorta, respectively. Multiple regression analyses performed 
      separately in the non-DM and DM patients showed that the plasma FGF-23 level, CaxPi 
      product, and body weight are independent factors significantly associated with 
      hand-artery calcification and that diastolic blood pressure is associated with aorta 
      calcification in non-DM patients. In DM patients, the plasma FGF-23 level and 
      hemodialysis duration emerged as independent factors associated with hand-artery 
      calcification and diastolic blood pressure was associated with aorta calcification. 
      The independent association of the plasma FGF-23 level with hand-artery 
      calcification was retained in both non-DM and DM patients when adjusted for the 
      CaxPi product. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the plasma FGF-23 level is an 
      independent factor negatively associated with peripheral vascular calcification in 
      the hand artery, but not in the aorta, in both male non-DM and DM hemodialysis 
      patients, even when adjusted for the CaxPi product. This study raises the 
      possibility that the plasma FGF-23 level may provide a reliable marker for 
      Moenckeberg's medial calcification in male hemodialysis patients, independent of its 
      regulatory effect on Pi metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a predictor of poor survival and 
      cardiovascular outcome in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; however, there is 
      scarce information of VC in Latin America, and virtually no data in our setting. We 
      undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of VC in a 
      hemodialysis (HD) population from western Mexico and to determine possible 
      associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed in 52 
      patients. VC was evaluated using plain X-ray films (Adragao's score) of hands and 
      pelvis; clinical and biochemical variables were also collected. Statistical analysis 
      was carried out with Student t and χ(2) tests performed as appropriate and logistic 
      regression to determine predictors of VC. RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years, 48% were 
      female, 23% had diabetes mellitus (DM), and median time on dialysis was 46 months. 
      Percentage prevalence was 52% with a mean calcification score of 2.0 ± 2.6; 23% of 
      patients had severe calcification. VC was present in about 23-37% among the 
      different vascular territories evaluated (radial, digital, femoral and iliac). 
      Patients with calcification were significantly older, had a higher frequency of DM, 
      higher alkaline phosphatase and lower HDL lipoproteins than those without VC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, VC in these patients was significantly predicted only by an 
      older age (OR [95% CI]: 1.15 [1.01-1.31], p = 0.04); lower HDL-cholesterol and 
      higher alkaline phosphatase were marginal predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Half of our HD 
      patients had VC. Territories of radial, iliac, femoral and digital arteries were 
      roughly equally affected, and 25% of patients had a calcification considered as 
      severe. Older age was the only significant predicting variable for VC, with low 
      HDL-cholesterol and high alkaline phosphatase as marginal predictors.

TI  - Vitamin K antagonism aggravates chronic kidney disease-induced neointimal 
      hyperplasia and calcification in arterialized veins: role of vitamin K treatment?
PG  - 601-11
AB  - Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the common vascular access type for a hemodialysis 
      patient. Its failure is due to neointimal hyperplasia. Vitamin K antagonists are 
      given to lower thrombosis tendency, but have side effects that enhance arterial 
      calcifications. Here, we investigated the effects of vitamin K antagonists and 
      vitamin K2 (K2) treatment on neointimal hyperplasia development and calcification in 
      rats and in arterialized human veins. AVF was generated in female rats while chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) was induced using an adenine-enriched diet. Arterialization, 
      CKD, and vitamin K antagonists all significantly enhanced venous neointimal 
      hyperplasia. K2 treatment, additional to vitamin K antagonists, significantly 
      reduced neointimal hyperplasia in arterialized veins in healthy rats but not in rats 
      with CKD. Arterialization, CKD, and vitamin K antagonism all significantly 
      increased, whereas K2 supplementation attenuated calcification in healthy rats and 
      rats with CKD. K2 significantly enhanced matrix Gla protein carboxylation in control 
      rats and rats with CKD. Arterialized human vein samples contained inactive matrix 
      Gla protein at calcification and neointimal hyperplasia sites, indicating local 
      vitamin K deficiency. Thus, vitamin K antagonists have detrimental effects on AVF 
      remodeling, whereas K2 reduced neointimal hyperplasia and calcification indicating 
      vasoprotective effects. Hence, K2 administration may be useful to prevent neointimal 
      hyperplasia and calcification in arterialized veins

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature vascular calcification (or rather ossification) significantly 
      contributes to morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 
      5 (CKD-5) and is linked to dysregulation of bone remodelling proteins. Recent 
      evidence of a cross-talk between bone and fat tissue urged us to investigate whether 
      the calcification/ossification-associated factors osteoprotegerin (OPG) and 
      alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) are expressed in human uremic subcutaneous adipose 
      tissue (SAT) and if the expression differs from nonuremic SAT. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Abdominal SAT biopsies were obtained from 38 patients with CKD-5 [16 women, 
      58 (22-73) years old] during the surgical insertion of a peritoneal dialysis 
      catheter and 20 controls [11 females, 56 (40-77) years old] undergoing elective 
      hernia repair or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) quantifications were performed followed by immunohistochemical staining and 
      serum protein concentration measurements. Relative mRNA expression and protein 
      concentrations were evaluated together with clinical parameters. An additional 59 
      patients with CKD-5 were included for replication of statistical analyses. RESULTS: 
      OPG but not AHSG mRNAs were detected in SAT, which were also positively 
      immunolabelled for OPG. OPG mRNA levels were reduced (P = ·0001) and serum OPG 
      concentrations were elevated (P < 0·0001), both about twofold, in patients compared 
      to controls. Circulating OPG increased in proportion to BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Human SAT 
      expresses OPG but not AHSG, and OPG expression is reduced in patients with CKD-5 
      when compared to controls, despite increased circulating protein levels.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and progression of aortic arch 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the 
      progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF)-23. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD 
      patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a 
      score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
      subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
      assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors 
      (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis duration in regressors 
      (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors (19.5±7.0 years) and 
      progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors 
      (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in non-progressors 
      (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple 
      regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum 
      levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (β 
      value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of 
      ΔAoACS. CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
      associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
      enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between inflammatory mediators, mitral 
      annular calcification (MAC), and osteocalcin in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echocardiographic data for 60 patients diagnosed as 
      CKD were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into 2 groups; 
      patients with MAC (MAC+ group) and patients without MAC (MAC- group). The 
      relationships between biochemical markers-including osteocalcin-and MAC were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 19 female and 41 male patients. In all, 29 
      patients were MAC+ and 31 were MAC-. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and 
      osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the MAC+ group (p < 0.05). The eGFR 
      was lower, serum calcitonin (we could not obtain calcitonin data for 15 patients), 
      Ca, PO4, CaxPO4, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red cell distribution width, 
      the neutrophil/Lymphocyte rate, and PTH were higher in the MAC+ group; however, the 
      differences between the groups were not significant (p > 0.05). The mitral E/A 
      ratio, mitral peak Ea velocity, tricuspid E/A ratio, hsCRP, and the osteocalcin 
      level were strongly correlated with MAC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      showed that only the osteocalcin level and mitral E/A ratio were independent 
      variables, each with an independent effect on MAC. CONCLUSION: CKD patients in the 
      MAC+ group had higher osteocalcin levels than those in the MAC- group, and left 
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction was more common in the MAC+ group.

TI  - Dual Roles of the Mineral Metabolism Disorders Biomarkers in Prevalent Hemodilysis 
      Patients: In Renal Bone Disease and in Vascular Calcification.
PG  - 134-144
LID - 10.2478/jomb-2018-0026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in dialysis (HD) 
      patients, and its mechanism is multifactorial. Most likely that systemic or local 
      inhibitory factor is overwhelmed by promoters of VC in these patients. VC increased 
      arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the present study aimed 
      to investigate the association of VC and myocardial remodeling and to analyze their 
      relationship with VC promoters (fibroblast growth factor 23-FGF23, Klotho, intact 
      parathormon-iPTH, vitamin D) in 56 prevalent HD patients (median values: age 54 yrs, 
      HD vintage 82 months). METHODS: Besides routine laboratory analyzes, serum levels of 
      FGF 23, soluble Klotho, iPTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; pulse wave velocity (PWV); 
      left ventricular (LV) mass by ultrasound; and VCs score by Adragao method were 
      measured. RESULTS: VC was found in 60% and LV concentric or eccentric hypertrophy in 
      50% patients. Dialysis vintage (OR 1.025, 95%CI 1.007-1.044, p=0.006) FGF23 (OR 
      1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.012, p=0.029) and serum magnesium (OR 0.000, 95%CI 
      0.000-0.214, p=0.04) were associated with VC. Changes in myocardial geometry was 
      associated with male sex (beta=-0.273, 95% CI -23.967 1.513, p=0.027), iPTH (beta 
      0.029, 95%CI -0.059-0.001, p=0.027) and vitamin D treatment (beta 25.49, 95%CI 
      11.325-39.667, p=0.001). Also, patients with the more widespread VC had the highest 
      LV remodeling categories. PWV was associated patient's age, cholesterol, diastolic 
      blood pressure, LV mass (positively) and serum calcium (negatively), indicating 
      potential link with atherosclerotic risk. CONCLUSIONS: Despite to different risk 
      factors for VC and myocardial remodeling, obtained results could indicate that risk 
      factors intertwine in long-term treatment of HD patients and therefore careful and 
      continuous correction of mineral metabolism disorders is undoubtedly of the utmost 
      importance.

TI  - Association of conjunctival and corneal calcification with vascular calcification in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and easily 
      detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
      calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone metabolism 
      parameters in dialysis patients. METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30 men, 33 
      women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were on dialysis therapy for more than 6 
      months. Forty-four patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients were on 
      hemodialysis therapy. The same observer evaluated the presence of CCC by using a 
      slit-lamp microscope, and a total CCC score was recorded for each patient. Fifty-two 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls also were evaluated by using the same method. 
      Biochemical data were collected from patient files. Bone mineral density (BMD) of 
      the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured, and the presence of vascular 
      calcification was assessed by using x-ray examinations of the pelvis and hands. 
      RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly higher than that in controls 
      (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC score correlated significantly with 
      duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s = 0.392; P = 0.002), serum phosphorus 
      level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium x phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 
      0.007). However, we did not find a significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The 
      frequency of vascular calcification was significantly greater in patients with a 
      high CCC score (CCC score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% 
      versus 5.6%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and 
      noninvasive method. It seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to 
      assess the status of extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

AB  - Medial arterial calcification (MAC) and renal osteodystrophy are complications of 
      mineral bone disease (MBD) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was 
      to develop a novel mouse model to investigate the clinical course of CKD-MBD. 
      Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were assigned to the following groups: the 
      control group, fed a standard chow for 6 or 12 weeks; the CKD-normal phosphorus (NP) 
      group, fed a chow containing 0.2% adenine, with normal (0.8%) phosphorus, for 6 or 
      12 weeks; and the CKD-high phosphorus (HP) group, fed 6 weeks with the 0.2% 
      adenine/0.8% phosphorus diet, followed by a chow with 1.8% phosphorus for 2 weeks, 4 
      weeks or 6 weeks. Serum phosphorus was significantly increased in the CKD-HP group, 
      and associated with MAC formation; the volume of calcification increased with longer 
      exposure to the high phosphorus feed. MAC was associated with upregulated expression 
      of runt-related transcription factor 2, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin, 
      indicative of osteoblastic trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. A 
      significant mineral density depletion of cortical bone was observed. We describe the 
      feasibility of developing a model of CKD-MBD and provide findings of a direct 
      association between elevated serum phosphorus and the formation of MAC and renal 
      osteodystrophy.

PG  - 586-595
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-17-0393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the echocardiographic 
      characteristics of chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) in a multicenter prospective cohort study.Methods and Results:Three hundred 
      and fifteen patients with ESRD (67.9±10.6 years, 47.6% male) on chronic HD for ≥1 
      year were examined on transthoracic echocardiography, including Doppler-derived 
      aortic valve area (AVA) measurement. Only 11.5% and 3.4% of all patients had normal 
      left ventricular (LV) geometry and normal LV filling pattern, respectively. The 
      majority of patients had aortic and mitral valvular calcification, and approximately 
      50% of all 315 patients had aortic valve narrowing with AVA <2.0 cm(2). Patients 
      were divided into 3 groups according to AVA index tertile: group 1, highest tertile; 
      group 2, middle tertile; and group 3, lowest tertile. Group 3 was older, had a 
      greater cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray, higher plasma brain natriuretic peptide 
      and total LV afterload, and lower stroke volume index than the other 2 groups. Age 
      and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level were independently associated with low 
      AVA index. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESRD on chronic HD have a high prevalence of 
      cardiac structural and functional abnormalities including calcified aortic 
      sclerosis. High age and PTH were associated with aortic valve narrowing in these 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients suffer from a high burden of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD). Partly this is due to progressive deterioration of calcium-phosphate 
      homeostasis. Previous studies suggested that besides FGF-23, low levels of Klotho, a 
      protein linked to aging, might constitute a key factor in this detrimental 
      relationship. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship 
      between serum Klotho (sKlotho) and the presence of CVD in dialysis patients. 
      METHODS: Plasma levels of sKlotho were measured in a cohort of dialysis patients and 
      related to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (defined as a LV ejection fraction<45%) 
      and LV mass using echocardiography. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and calcification 
      score were assessed using computed tomography angiography. Abdominal aortic 
      calcification score (AACscore) was measured by abdominal X-ray. RESULTS: We included 
      127 dialysis patients, 67±7 years old, 76% male, 67% on hemodialysis, median sKlotho 
      460 pg/mL (25th-75th percentile 350-620 pg/mL). Patients with a low sKlotho (<460 
      pg/mL) showed significantly more CAD (81% versus 61%; p=0.02) and LV dysfunction 
      (19% versus 3%; p<0.01). However, after adjusting for confounders, sKlotho was not 
      independently associated with the presence of CVD or the AACscore. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      the present cohort of dialysis patients, sKlotho was not independently associated 
      with CVD. However, patients with a low sKlotho level (<460 pg/mL) did show CAD and 
      LV dysfunction more frequently. Therefore, while sKlotho might be a marker for CVD 
      in dialysis patients, the current data does not support a direct cardioprotective 
      effect of sKlotho.

AB  - Hemodialysis patients have extremely increased cardiovascular mortality. Vascular 
      calcification, inflammation, and low serum fetuin-A levels are implicated for 
      increased mortality. In this study, relationship between coronary artery 
      calcification, inflammation, and serum fetuin-A levels were investigated. 
      Seventy-eight hemodialysis patients (38 male, 40 female, mean age: 52±14.5 years) 
      were included. All patients were on dialysis for more than 6 months. Coronary artery 
      calcium scores (CACS) are determined by electron-beam computed tomography. Serum 
      CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and serum fetuin-A levels were measured. Mean CACS value 
      was 488.5±94.5. Serum fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with CACS (r:-0.30, 
      P=0.009). Patients are divided into two groups according to total CACS value; group 
      1 (CACS<10), group 2 (CACS≥10). There was a statistically significance difference in 
      fetuin-A levels between CACS group 1 and group 2 (P=0.001). In this study, serum 
      fetuin-A levels were associated with total CACS. This Fetuin-A may play a role in 
      increased mortality in this group of patients via facilitating CAC.

TI  - Prevalence and Effects of Functional Vitamin K Insufficiency: The PREVEND Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu9121334 [doi]
LID - 1334
AB  - Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is a strong vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of soft tissue 
      calcification. We assessed the prevalence of functional vitamin K insufficiency, as 
      derived from plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), and investigated 
      whether plasma dp-ucMGP is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 
      a large general population-based cohort. We included 4275 subjects (aged 53 ± 12 
      years, 46.0% male) participating in the prospective general population-based 
      Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study. The prevalence 
      of functional vitamin K insufficiency (i.e., dp-ucMGP > 500 pmol/L) was 31% in the 
      total study population. This prevalence was significantly higher among elderly and 
      subjects with comorbidities like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney 
      disease, and cardiovascular disease (~50%). After 10 years of follow-up, 279 
      subjects had died, with 74 deaths attributable to cardiovascular causes. We found 
      significant J-shaped associations of plasma dp-ucMGP with all-cause (linear term: 
      hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.20 (0.12-0.33), p < 0.001; 
      squared term: 1.14 (1.10-1.17), p < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (linear 
      term: 0.12 (0.05-0.27), p < 0.001; squared term: 1.17 (1.11-1.23), p < 0.001). These 
      associations remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. 
      Whether the correction of vitamin K insufficiency improves health outcomes needs to 
      be addressed in future prospective intervention studies.

TI  - A Nationally Representative Study of Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy Risk Factors.
PG  - 3421-3429
AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is 
      necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated 
      whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would identify patients 
      at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using data from a large 
      dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) 
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race 
      in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients 
      and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively; 67% of participants were women and 
      49% were white. Median duration between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA 
      development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; 
      higher levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and 
      nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with 
      increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes 
      receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a 
      dose-response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh 
      areas (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for more 
      than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between 
      recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years 
      before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of preventive 
      strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Serum fetuin A and chemerin levels correlate with hepatic steatosis and regional 
      adiposity in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - e38415

LID - e38415
AB  - BACKGROUND: A deficiency of fetuin A is linked to cardiovascular calcification and 
      mortality in dialysis patients. But, high levels of fetuin A and chemerin correlate 
      with hepatic steatosis and regional adiposity in general population. The association 
      between hepatic steatosis and fetuin A/chemerin levels in hemodialysis (HD) remains 
      unclear. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, observational study; 216 prevalent 
      HD patients from a single center were enrolled. Baseline serum fetuin A, chemerin 
      levels, conicity index and anthropometric parameters were checked. Presence of 
      hepatic steatosis was qualified by liver ultrasound and quantified by the 
      hepato-renal index (HRI); central obesity defined by waist circumference (WC). ROC 
      analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses for prediction of hepatic 
      steatosis and central obesity on the basis of fetuin A/chemerin levels, 
      anthropometric parameters, and other relevant covariates were performed. RESULTS: 
      Data from 103 women and 113 men (mean age 60±12 years) were analyzed. Eighty 
      subjects had hepatic steatosis and their HRIs were significantly higher than those 
      without hepatic steatosis (P<0.001). Serum fetuin A levels were positively 
      associated with HRIs (P<0.001) and chemerin levels (P<0.001). Fetuin A, chemerin and 
      WC were predictors for hepatic steatosis and central obesity by ROC curve. In 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis, fetuin A and WC independently predicted 
      hepatic steatosis defined by HRIs. And chemerin predicted central obesity and 
      regional adiposity after covariate adjustments (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum 
      fetuin A levels were higher in prevalent HD patients with hepatic steatosis, and 
      positively correlated with chemerin levels. Chemerin levels predicted central 
      obesity as well as regional adiposity in the HD patients.

AB  - Abnormal bone dynamics is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. The level of serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) is 
      widely used as a bone dynamic marker. We investigated the effect of the mean level 
      of serum iPTH on overall mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in incident dialysis 
      patients. PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD). CKD-MBD is classified as low- or high-turnover bone disease 
      according to the bone dynamics; both are related to vascular calcification in ESRD. 
      To evaluate the prognostic value of abnormal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 
      on ESRD patients, we investigated the effects of time-averaged serum intact PTH 
      (TA-iPTH) levels on overall mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular 
      events (MACCEs) in incident dialysis patients. METHODS: Four hundred thirteen 
      patients who started dialysis between January 2009 and September 2013 at Yonsei 
      University Health System were enrolled. The patients were divided into three groups 
      according to TA-iPTH levels during the 12 months after the initiation of dialysis: 
      group 1, <65 pg/ml; group 2, 65-300 pg/ml; and group 3, >300 pg/ml. Cox regression 
      analyses were performed to determine the prognostic value of TA-iPTH for overall 
      mortality and MACCEs. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57 ± 15 years, and 
      222 patients (54 %) were men. During the median follow-up of 40.8 ± 29.3 months, 49 
      patients (12 %) died, and MACCEs occurred in 55 patients (13 %). The multivariate 
      Cox regression analyses demonstrated that a low TA-iPTH level was an independent 
      risk factor for both overall mortality (group 2 as reference; group 1: hazard ratio 
      (HR) = 2.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-3.83, P = 0.023) and MACCEs 
      (HR = 1.82, 95 % CI = 1.04-3.20, P = 0.036) in incident dialysis patients after 
      adjustment for confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Low serum TA-iPTH is a useful 
      clinical marker of both overall mortality and MACCEs in patients undergoing incident 
      dialysis, mediated by vascular calcification.

TI  - Fetuin-A and arterial stiffness in patients with normal kidney function.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.12.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between fetuin-A level (AHSG), its encoding gene 
      (Thr256Ser) and arterial function in subjects with normal kidney function. 
      INTRODUCTION: The aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a predictor for 
      cardiovascular mortality. Fetuin-A is a calcification inhibitor and correlates 
      negatively with increased vascular stiffness in dialysis patients. The fetuin-A 
      polymorphism (Thr256Ser) is associated with reduced fetuin levels and accelerated 
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Little is known about the role of 
      fetuin-A as an independent predictor for the development of arterial stiffness in 
      healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 116 subjects with normal kidney 
      function (age 47+/-12 years, 50 females and 66 males) of the FLEMENGHO study. 
      Calcium measurements, plasma fetuin-A, its encoding gene (Thr256Ser) and indexes of 
      arterial stiffness, such as aPWV and arterial distensibility, were determined. 
      RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aPWV (r=-0.21, p=0.029). 
      After an adjustment for multiple covariables, fetuin-A levels were independently 
      associated with aPWV (r=-0.30, p=0.022) in males but not in females. Male fetuin-A 
      SerSer carrier had lower fetuin-A levels and higher aPWV (fetuin-A: 61.9+/-29.0 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 14.3+/-0.9 m/s) as compared to ThrThr (fetuin-A: 109.9+/-54.9 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.4+/-1.3 m/s) and ThrSer carrier (fetuin-A: 100.8+/-52.5 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.6+/-1.3 m/s). Other calcium variables were not significantly 
      associated with arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: With respect to common calcium 
      variables, only fetuin-A level showed an inverse relation with aPWV in men with 
      normal renal function. Male fetuin-A SerSer carriers demonstrate particularly high 
      aortic stiffness, possibly implying a status of increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species as mediators of chronic kidney 
      disease-related vascular calcification.
PG  - 746-55
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpu225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification, a regulated process in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), requires vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation into 
      osteoblast-like cells. This phenomenon can be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines and 
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CKD rats with vascular 
      calcification, we investigated whether inflammatory cytokines, ROS generation, and 
      downstream signaling events are associated with CKD-related vascular calcification. 
      METHODS: CKD was induced in male Wistar rats by renal mass ablation and vascular 
      calcification was induced with a high calcium-phosphate diet and vitamin D 
      supplementation (Ca/P/VitD). At week 3-6, hemodynamic parameters were determined and 
      thoracic aorta was harvested for assessment of vascular calcification, macrophage 
      infiltration, cytokines expression, VSMC differentiation, ROS generation, and 
      related signaling pathway activation. RESULTS: CKD rats treated with Ca/P/VitD 
      developed medial calcification of thoracic aorta and increased pulse pressure and 
      aortic pulse wave velocity. VSMC differentiation was confirmed by increased bone 
      morphogenetic protein-2 and osteocalcin expression and reduced α-smooth muscle actin 
      expression. The expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis 
      factor were also increased. The expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
      phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunits p22(phox) and p47(phox) were increased, whereas 
      the expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, Gpx1, and Prdx1) was reduced in 
      CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats. Oxidized peroxiredoxin, a sensor of ROS generation, was 
      significantly increased and ROS-sensitive signaling pathways were activated in the 
      aorta from CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a relationship 
      between inflammation/ROS and arterial calcification in CKD and contributes to 
      understanding of the complex pathways that mediate arterial calcification in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and mortality in diabetic patients with proteinuria.
PG  - 1107-14
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.70 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk 
      associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and 
      often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the 
      prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 
      diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric 
      diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). 
      Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was 
      diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, 
      male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an 
      average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the 
      severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on 
      both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of 
      calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the 
      severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney 
      disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need 
      to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification 
      in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

TI  - Cutaneous calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a regulated 
      process associated with in situ osteopontin expression.
PG  - 900-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calcification, or calcinosis cutis (CC), is found in 
      approximately 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic 
      dialysis. While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it may be similar to those 
      for medial and intimal vascular calcifications, which are actively regulated 
      processes. OBSERVATION: In a retrospective study of 9 patients, the role of an 
      active calcification process leading to CC was assessed by the immunohistochemical 
      detection of osteopontin, which is a regulator of osseous and extra-osseous 
      calcification processes. Calcinosis cutis was associated with female sex, vascular 
      comorbidity, inconstant secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of plasma 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Six patients had a favorable outcome after the lowering 
      of plasma calcium levels during dialysis or after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Calcinosis of the vascular media of subcutaneous vessels was the most common 
      histologic feature and was always associated with osteopontin staining, suggesting 
      that CC is a regulated process. Moreover, to our knowledge, extravascular staining 
      of osteopontin in sweat glands, nerves, and macrophages was demonstrated for the 
      first time in this study.

TI  - Pathophysiological role of vascular smooth muscle alkaline phosphatase in medial 
      artery calcification.
PG  - 824-36
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.2420 [doi]
AB  - Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is a pathological phenomenon that causes 
      vascular stiffening and can lead to heart failure; it is common to a variety of 
      conditions, including aging, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and a 
      variety of rare genetic diseases. These conditions share the common feature of 
      tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) upregulation in the vasculature. To 
      evaluate the role of TNAP in MVC, we developed a mouse model that overexpresses 
      human TNAP in vascular smooth muscle cells in an X-linked manner. Hemizygous 
      overexpressor male mice (Tagln-Cre(+/-) ; Hprt(ALPL) (/Y) or TNAP-OE) show extensive 
      vascular calcification, high blood pressure, and cardiac hypertrophy, and have a 
      median age of death of 44 days, whereas the cardiovascular phenotype is much less 
      pronounced and life expectancy is longer in heterozygous (Tagln-Cre(+/-) ; 
      Hprt(ALPL) (/-) ) female TNAP-OE mice. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation 
      of osteoblast and chondrocyte markers and decreased expression of vascular smooth 
      muscle markers in the aortas of TNAP-OE mice. Through medicinal chemistry efforts, 
      we developed inhibitors of TNAP with drug-like pharmacokinetic characteristics. 
      TNAP-OE mice were treated with the prototypical TNAP inhibitor SBI-425 or vehicle to 
      evaluate the feasibility of TNAP inhibition in vivo. Treatment with this inhibitor 
      significantly reduced aortic calcification and cardiac hypertrophy, and extended 
      lifespan over vehicle-treated controls, in the absence of secondary effects on the 
      skeleton. This study shows that TNAP in the vasculature contributes to the pathology 
      of MVC and that it is a druggable target.

TI  - Progression of coronary artery calcification in renal transplantation and the role 
      of secondary hyperparathyroidism and inflammation.
PG  - 685-90
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03930808 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Transplantation should favorably affect coronary 
      calcification (CAC) progression in dialysis; however, changes in CAC score in the 
      individual patient are not reliably evaluated. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & 
      MEASUREMENTS: The authors used special tables of reproducibility limits for each 
      score level to study, by multislice computed tomography and biochemistries, the 
      2-year changes in CAC in 41 transplant patients (age 48 +/- 13 yr, 25 men, dialysis 
      vintage 4.8 +/- 4.3 yr, underwent transplant 6.2 +/- 5.5 yr prior). Thirty balanced 
      dialysis patients served as controls. RESULTS: In the study group, Agatston score 
      was stable, and C-reactive protein decreased, whereas fetuin and osteoprotegerin 
      increased. In the control group, Agatston score increased, parathyroid hormone and 
      phosphate decreased, and inflammation markers were persistently twice as high as in 
      the study group. With regard to individual changes, 12.2% transplant patients 
      worsened, compared with 56.6% of patients in dialysis (P < 0.0001). Patients without 
      calcification at entry showed slower progression in transplantation (8.3%) than in 
      dialysis (44.4%; P < 0.034), and the difference was similar to that observed in 
      cases with CAC (17.6% versus 61.9%; P < 0.007). Discriminant analysis indicated 
      parathyroid hormone, the modality of therapy (dialysis or transplantation), and 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate as the variables most associated with worsening. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplantation lowers but does not halt CAC progression. 
      Inflammation and hyperparathyroidism are associated with progression in the 
      populations studied.

TI  - A Rare Case of Calciphylaxis in an Orthotopic Liver Transplant Recipient with Acute 
      Kidney Injury.
LID - 10.6002/ect.2017.0123 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare disease characterized by calcification of small- to 
      medium-sized blood vessels in the dermis and subcutaneous fat, resulting in 
      cutaneous necrosis. Although most commonly shown in patients with end-stage kidney 
      disease, it has also been reported in patients with other diseases, including 
      alcoholic cirrhosis and malignancies. Here, we report an unusual case of 
      calciphylaxis in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient with acute kidney injury. 
      The patient, a 43-year-old white female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      alcoholic cirrhosis, and normal kidney function, presented with decompensated liver 
      disease and hepatorenal syndrome; she no longer responded to medical treatment and 
      required treatment with dialysis. Ten days after admission, she underwent liver 
      transplant, resulting in improved liver function tests. She had acute tubular 
      necrosis (creatinine peak: 325 μmol/L) from sustained hypotension during and after 
      surgery, which required 4 sessions of dialysis over 2weeks. Six weeks after her 
      transplant, she developed painful, nonulcerating, erythematous plaques over her 
      shins and thighs. Skin biopsy of the lesions showed calciphylaxis, calcium deposits, 
      and thrombotic vasculopathy. She also developed severe hypercalcemia (calcium level 
      of 2.75 mmol/L) from immobility, which required treatment with a bisphosphonate and 
      hemodialysis. The lesions improved 6 weeks later, and her renal function returned to 
      normal. Calciphylaxis diagnosed in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient with 
      acute kidney injury has not been previously reported. We hypothesize that her 
      chronic inflammatory state caused down-regulation and low levels of fetuin A and 
      protein C. She also had other risk factors, including hypoalbuminemia, obesity, 
      systemic glucocorticoids, and alcoholic liver disease. Calciphylaxis can occur in 
      patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and acute renal failure even after liver 
      transplant. Further studies into the pathogenesis of this disease may help us 
      understand why it develops in these patients and not others with the same risk 
      factors.

TI  - Low serum fetuin A levels and incident stroke in patients with maintenance 
      haemodialysis.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.1111/eci.12057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients, 
      is associated with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. Whether it predicts stroke remains unknown. This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between fetuin A and incident stoke in maintenance HD 
      patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: This is a prospective 
      observational study. 238 prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean age, 60 
      ± 12 years) were followed up for the occurrence of stroke for 55 months. Baseline 
      circulating fetuin A levels, biochemical data and other markers of inflammation were 
      measured. The major outcome was the occurrence of incident ischaemic or haemorrhagic 
      stroke. RESULTS: Thirty one patients had incident strokes; an incidence of 38·4/1000 
      patient-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 36·5-39·8/1000 patient-years) on 
      follow-up. Patients in the lowest tertile of fetuin A concentration had highest risk 
      to have incident stroke (P < 0·001, log-rank test). By Cox proportional-hazards 
      regression, patients with higher fetuin A levels experienced lower incidence of 
      stroke, hazard ratio (HR) of 0·89 (95% CI, 0·84-0·96), while those with higher mean 
      arterial blood pressure had an HR of 1·19 (95% CI, 1·07-1·34) and those with higher 
      calcium phosphate product (CaxP) had an HR of 1·39 (95% CI, 1·1-1·73) for having 
      strokes. For patients without previous history of diabetes and cerebrovascular 
      disease, fetuin A deficiency also predicts the occurrence of incident stroke. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated with a higher risk of incident stroke 
      among prevalent HD patients.

TI  - Relationship between magnesium and clinical biomarkers on inhibition of vascular 
      calcification.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.1159/000334742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are strongly associated with 
      vascular calcification. Hyperphosphatemia is an essential risk factor for increased 
      vascular calcification. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients could serve as an in 
      vivo model for accelerated calcification. This study focuses on the most likely 
      protective effects of magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) on phosphate-induced vascular 
      calcification ex vivo/in vitro. Furthermore, plasma Mg(2+) concentrations of ESRD 
      and healthy controls were investigated for association with surrogate parameters of 
      vascular calcification in vivo. METHODS: Aortic segments of male Wistar-Kyoto rats 
      were incubated and the phosphate concentration of the medium was elevated. The 
      aortic segments were incubated in the absence and presence of MgCl(2); tissue 
      calcification was quantified by different methods. Serum Mg(2+) concentrations of 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 5; ESRD) and patients without CKD 
      (controls) were associated with carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and aortic 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) as surrogate parameter for arteriosclerosis and arterial 
      stiffening. RESULTS: Incubation of aortic segments in the presence of 
      β-glycerophosphate and NaH(2)PO(4) caused an increased tissue Ca(2+) deposition 
      compared to control conditions. This increased amount of Ca(2+) in the aortic rings 
      was significantly decreased in the presence of Mg(2+). In CKD patients, but not in 
      controls, magnesium serum concentration was associated with the IMT of the carotid 
      arteries. In addition, CKD patients with higher magnesium serum concentration had a 
      significantly lower PWV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Elevated phosphate 
      concentrations in the culture media induce ex vivo/in vitro medial calcification in 
      intact rat aortic rings in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Mg(2+) ions reduced 
      ex vivo/in vitro vascular calcification despite increased phosphate concentration. 
      This hypothesis is additionally based on the fact that CKD patients with high Mg(2) 
      serum levels had significantly lower IMT and PWV values, which may result in a lower 
      risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in these patients. Therefore, Mg(2+) 
      supplementation may be an option for treatment and prevention of vascular 
      calcification resulting in a reduction of cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

TI  - Association of serum calcitonin with coronary artery disease in individuals with and 
      without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1169-75
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0076-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral 
      metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as 
      novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, 
      another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in 
      detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and 
      the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, 
      in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 
      87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the associations 
      between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × phosphate 
      product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, the Gensini CAD 
      severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 
      25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for 
      the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin 
      D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), 
      FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini 
      score. In the second step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, 
      proteinuria, and GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained 
      statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of 
      mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater severity 
      of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and nontraditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger populations including 
      patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

PG  - 21-7
LID - 10.1007/s11010-012-1500-y [doi]
AB  - The increased vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has been associated with disturbances in 
      mineral-bone metabolism. In order to determine markers of the vascular calcification 
      frequently observed in these patients, blood samples of elderly male and female 
      hemodialysis CKD patients were used to measure serum levels of: osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (sRANKL), and 
      fetuin-A by enzyme immunoassay; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP-5b), and 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) by immunoenzymometric assay; osteocalcin 
      (OC) by ELISA; iPTH by immunoradiometric assay; 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), by 
      I(125) radioimmunoassay; and calcium and phosphorus by photometric assay. Serum OPG, 
      BAP, iPTH, phosphorus, and OC levels were higher and serum 25(OH)D(3), 
      1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and fetuin-A levels lower in both male and female CKD patients than 
      in their respective controls. Our results indicate that the bone formation and 
      resorption parameters are altered in elderly male and female hemodialysis CKD 
      patients. These changes may lead to vascular calcifications and cardiovascular 
      complications, given that elevated OPG and OC levels and reduced fetuin-A levels are 
      associated with cardiovascular events.

LID - 10.1159/000494441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed 
      the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray 
      examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
      biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients 
      with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited 
      lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
      associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
      AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
      dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
      circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were independently associated with AoAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are major contributors to 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among chronic kidney disease patients. The 
      mevalonate pathway may play a role in this vascular pathology. Farnesyltransferase 
      inhibitors such as R115777 block one branch of mevalonate pathway. We studied the 
      effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 on vascular disease in 
      apolipoprotein E deficient mice with chronic renal failure and on mineral deposition 
      in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female uremic and non-uremic apolipoprotein E 
      deficient mice were randomly assigned to four groups and treated with either 
      farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 or vehicle. Farnesyltransferase inhibitor 
      R115777 inhibited protein prenylation in mice with chronic renal failure. It 
      decreased aortic atheromatous lesion area and calcification in these animals, and 
      reduced vascular nitrotyrosine expression and total collagen as well as collagen 
      type I content. Proteomic analysis revealed that farnesyltransferase inhibitor 
      corrected the chronic renal failure-associated increase in serum apolipoprotein IV 
      and α globin, and the chronic renal failure-associated decrease in serum fetuin A. 
      Farnesyltransferase inhibitor further inhibited type I collagen synthesis and 
      reduced mineral deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, probably 
      involving Ras-Raf pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that 
      farnesyltransferase inhibition slows vascular disease progression in chronic renal 
      failure by both indirect systemic and direct local actions. This beneficial effect 
      was mediated via a reduction in oxidative stress and favorable changes in 
      vasoprotective peptides.

TI  - Relationship between circulating FGF23 and total body atherosclerosis in the 
      community.
PG  - 3125-31
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a regulator of mineral metabolism 
      and has been suggested to play a role in vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Data on the association between FGF23 and atherosclerosis, both in 
      CKD and in the community, is limited. METHODS: The total body atherosclerosis score 
      (AS) was determined by a magnetic resonance imaging-based angiography in 306 elderly 
      men and women, representing a subsample of the community-based PIVUS cohort. 
      Subjects were divided into three categories based on AS: AS = 0, low AS and high AS. 
      Serum FGF23 was measured using a two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA. RESULTS: In 
      continuous and multi-category regression models, higher FGF23 was associated with a 
      significant increase in the odds of having a high AS (OR 1.43, CI 1.06-1.92 to OR 
      3.01, CI 1.52-5.99). This association was stronger in individuals with eGFR <60 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 27), reaching a nearly 6-fold increase in the odds for a high 
      AS in the upper FGF23 tertile (OR 5.64, CI 2.78-11.5). We found weaker support for a 
      relationship between FGF23 and the presence of atherosclerosis as subjects in the 
      highest FGF23 tertile had an increased risk for an AS > 0 in crude models (OR 1.93, 
      CI 1.05-3.55), but this was not statistically significant in adjusted (OR 1.42, CI 
      0.74-1.72) models. CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence supporting an association 
      between serum FGF23 and total body atherosclerosis in the community. Additional 
      studies are warranted to determine the prospective relationship between FGF23 and 
      atherosclerosis, and whether FGF23 is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

TI  - Functional deficiency of vitamin K in hemodialysis patients in Upper Silesia in 
      Poland.
PG  - 765-71
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1255-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Functional vitamin K deficiency (both K1 and K2) is postulated to be one of 
      the most relevant links between chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommended dietary restrictions in HD patients 
      superimposed on diversity of eating habits across the countries may affect the 
      prevalence of functional vitamin K deficiency. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the level of functional vitamin K deficiency and its relation to vitamin 
      K1 intake in HD patients in Upper Silesia in Poland. METHODS: Protein-induced 
      vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) and undercarboxylated matrix Gla 
      protein (ucMGP) were assessed by ELISA in 153 stable, prevalent HD patients and 20 
      apparently healthy adults (to establish normal ranges for PIVKA-II and ucMGP). Daily 
      phylloquinone intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      PIVKA-II and ucMGP levels were increased in 27.5 and 77.1 % of HD patients in 
      comparison with the reference ranges in apparently healthy controls, respectively. 
      In 45 % of cases, the increased PIVKA-II level was explained by insufficient 
      phylloquinone intake for Polish population (recommended intake: >55 μg for women and 
      >65 µg for men). Applying ROC analysis, we showed that vitamin K1 intake below 40.2 
      µg/day was associated with increased PIVKA-II levels. There was no correlation 
      between vitamin K1 intake and plasma concentration of ucMGP, or between PIVKA-II and 
      ucMGP. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Functional vitamin K1 deficiency is explained by low vitamin 
      K1 intake in less than half of HD patients. (2) Undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein 
      level is a poor surrogate for functional vitamin K1 deficiency.

TI  - De novo development of heart valve calcification in incident peritoneal dialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 638-44
LID - S0188-4409(13)00260-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arcmed.2013.10.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) is a frequent complication in 
      chronic kidney disease and is considered a risk factor for all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality. However, little is known about the pathophysiology 
      mechanisms that originate it and the factors associated with its development. We 
      undertook this study to analyze the frequency and factors related to de novo 
      development of mitral valve calcification (MVC) and aortic valve calcifications 
      (AVC) in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort 
      of 124 incident PD patients was studied. Demographic and clinical data were recorded 
      and blood assayed at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up for calcium, phosphorus, 
      glucose, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides by spectrophotometry assay; 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) by immunoturbidimetric ultrasensitive 
      assay, intact parathormone (iPTH) and osteocalcin by electrochemiluminescence, 
      fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin by EDI-ELISA. Valve calcification was evaluated by 
      M-mode bidimensional echocardiogram. RESULTS: Sixty eight percent of patients were 
      male, ages 43 ± 13 years; 51% were diabetic with 1.4 ± 1 months on PD. After 12.3 ± 
      1 months, 57 patients (46%) developed VC: AVC in 33 (57.8%), MVC in 15 (26.3%) and 9 
      (15.8%) patients in both valves. There was no correlation between AVC and MCV. In 
      univariate logistic regression analysis, age, diabetes and elevated concentrations 
      of OPG, iPTH and CRP were risk factors for development MVC. In multivariate 
      analysis, only iPTH remained an independent risk factor as was also the case in AVC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Age, diabetes, osteoprotegerin, parathormone and C-reactive protein are 
      risk factors related to de novo development of MVC and iPTH for AVC in incident 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - Total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are associated with bone mineral 
      density over time in end-stage renal disease patients starting dialysis.
PG  - 255-262
LID - 10.1007/s40620-016-0292-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP (BALP) are implicated 
      in the abnormal skeletal mineralization and accelerated vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Whereas ALP and BALP may predict mortality in 
      CKD, BALP is reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity than total ALP in 
      reflecting histological alterations in bone; however, results on their associations 
      with bone mineral density (BMD) are inconsistent. Here we evaluated associations of 
      total ALP and BALP with BMD during up to 24 months in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 194 ESRD patients (median age 
      57 years, 66 % male, 32 % diabetes mellitus, mean body mass index 24.8 kg/m(2)) 
      underwent measurements of total ALP and BALP and total and regional body BMD (by 
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) at dialysis initiation (n = 194), and after 12 
      (n = 98) and 24 months (n = 40) on dialysis. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had 
      median total ALP 65.4 (43.3-126.4) U/l, BALP 13.5 (7.1-27.3) µg/l and BMD 1.14 
      (0.97-1.31) g/cm(2). During the study period, serum concentrations of ALP and BALP 
      increased significantly (p < 0.001), whereas total and regional BMD remained stable. 
      BMD correlated inversely with total ALP (rho = -0.20, p = 0.005) and BALP 
      (rho = -0.30, p < 0.001) at baseline, and correlations were similar also at 12 and 
      24 months. CONCLUSION: ALP and BALP are equally accurate albeit weak predictors of 
      BMD in ESRD patients, both at baseline and longitudinally. The dissociation between 
      stable BMD and increasing ALP and BALP may possibly reflect increased soft tissue 
      calcifications with time on dialysis.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification and atherosclerosis at the initiation of hemodialysis 
      in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 360-9
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery 
      calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship 
      between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with 
      ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC 
      and CAP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
      multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
      respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence 
      of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were 
      also evaluated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found 
      in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria 
      and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with 
      age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant 
      for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
      (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high 
      OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP 
      were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk 
      factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be 
      an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong 
      relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.

TI  - Increased circulating sclerostin levels in end-stage renal disease predict 
      biopsy-verified vascular medial calcification and coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 1356-1364
LID - 10.1038/ki.2015.194 [doi]
AB  - Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to mineral 
      bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of vascular 
      calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with measures of 
      calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with end-stage renal 
      disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in the serum of patients 
      with epigastric and coronary artery calcification (calcification score 100 or more). 
      In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin levels significantly associated with 
      age, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent 
      calcification. Multivariable regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin 
      each significantly associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. 
      Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) 
      predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein expressions 
      were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and non-calcified vessels, 
      suggesting that the vasculature is not a major contributor to circulating levels. 
      Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate with the extent of vascular 
      calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery CT and scoring of epigastric 
      artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers of mineral bone disorder, only 
      sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

AB  - Osteoprotegerin (OPG) regulates bone mass by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation 
      and activation, and plays a role in vascular calcification. We evaluated the 
      relationship between osteoprotegerin levels and inflammatory markers, 
      atherosclerosis, and mortality in patients with stages 3-5 chronic kidney disease. A 
      total of 145 subjects (median age 61 years, 61% men; 36 patients on hemodialysis, 55 
      patients on peritoneal dialysis, and 54 patients with stages 3-5 chronic kidney 
      disease) were studied. Clinical characteristics, markers of mineral metabolism 
      (including fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23]) and inflammation (high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and the intima-media thickness 
      (IMT) in the common carotid arteries were measured at baseline. Cardiac function was 
      assessed by color tissue Doppler echocardiography. After 36 months follow-up, the 
      survival rate by Kaplan-Meier analysis was significantly different according to OPG 
      levels (χ ² =14.33; P=0.002). Increased OPG levels were positively associated with 
      IL-6 (r=0.38, P<0.001), FGF-23 (r=0.26, P<0.001) and hsCRP (r=0.0.24, P=0.003). In 
      addition, OPG was positively associated with troponin I (r=0.54, P<0.001) and IMT 
      (r=0.39, P<0.0001). Finally, in Cox analysis, only OPG (HR=1.07, 95%CI=1.02-1.13) 
      and hsCRP (HR=1.02, 95%CI=1.01-1.04) were independently associated with increased 
      risk of death. These results suggested that elevated levels of serum OPG might be 
      associated with atherosclerosis and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease.

      kidney disease.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), osteodystrophy and arterial calcification often 
      coexist. However, arterial alterations have not been addressed in CKD unaccompanied 
      by evidence of calcification. We investigated the association of phosphate (P) and 
      calcium (Ca) accumulation in calcification-free aortas with CKD-induced 
      osteodystrophy. Aortic accumulation of magnesium (Mg), an inhibitor of 
      calcification, was also examined. Male mice aged 26 weeks with CKD characterized by 
      hyperparathyroidism and hyperphosphatemia (Nx, n = 8) and age-matched healthy male 
      mice (shams, n = 8) were sampled for blood, and thoracic vertebrae and aortas were 
      harvested. Bone structure and chemicals were analyzed by microcomputed tomography 
      and infrared microspectroscopy, respectively, and aortic accumulation of P, Ca, and 
      Mg was evaluated by plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Volume fractions of 
      cortical and trabecular bones were smaller in Nx than in sham animals (P < 0.05), 
      attributed to cortical thinning and reduction in trabecular number, respectively. 
      Bone chemicals were not different between the groups. No calcification was found in 
      either group, but P, Ca, and Mg contents were higher in Nx than in shams (P < 0.05). 
      The mass ratio of Ca/P was lower in Nx than in shams (P < 0.05), but that of Mg/Ca 
      and Mg/P was not different between the groups. Aortic P and Ca contents were 
      inversely correlated with the volume fraction of cortical bone (P < 0.05). In 
      conclusion, the relationship of osteodystrophy with aortic P and Ca accumulation 
      suggests the existence of a bone-vascular axis, even in calcification-free arteries 
      in CKD. The preservation of ratios of Mg/Ca and Mg/P despite CKD development might 
      contribute to calcification resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
      remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also 
      a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to 
      test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. METHODS: we measured 
      serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year 
      period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, 
      patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were 
      included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 
      patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower 
      creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl 
      (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk 
      analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and 
      gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve 
      these patients survival needs to be determined.

TI  - Novel mechanisms in accelerated vascular calcification in renal disease patients.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular calcification occurs more often and earlier in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease than in normal controls. It is a regulated biological 
      process following many of the cellular and molecular programs in osteogenesis. This 
      review summarizes some of the regulatory mechanisms that may explain its severity in 
      renal patients. RECENT FINDINGS: A subpopulation of cells from arteries and cardiac 
      valves produce a mineralizing matrix and undergo osteoblastic differentiation. 
      Osteogenic differentiation regulators are found in calcified but not normal 
      arteries. Phosphate levels have dramatic effects on vascular calcification in vitro, 
      through a sodium phosphate transporter signaling molecular changes. Atherogenic 
      oxidized lipids promote osteoblastic differentiation of vascular cells and inhibit 
      bone mineralization. In uremic patients, the severity of dyslipidemia corresponds 
      with the progression of vascular calcification. Oxidative stress and inflammatory 
      mediators may underlie the effects of oxidized lipids. In dialysis patients, the 
      degree of cardiac valvular calcification corresponds with levels of C-reactive 
      protein. Genetic factors may also contribute. Polymorphisms of the inflammatory 
      adhesion molecule, E-selectin, associate with coronary calcification in young women. 
      Mice deficient in matrix GLA protein, which inhibits bone morphogenetic protein 
      activity, develop complete ossification of the aorta, presumably as a result of 
      unopposed osteogenic activity on vascular mesenchyme. Since matrix GLA protein 
      function requires gamma-carboxylation of its glutamate residues by a vitamin K 
      dependent carboxylase, warfarin treatment may affect vascular calcification by 
      blocking vitamin K and hence matrix GLA protein activity. SUMMARY: These findings 
      indicate that vascular calcification is regulated both positively and negatively by 
      a wide variety of mechanisms affecting patients with renal disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients, and it occurs mostly due to 
      ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we aimed at investigating the prevalence of 
      ventricular arrhythmia and the factors associated with its occurrence in nondialyzed 
      chronic kidney disease patients. DESIGN SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: This 
      cross-sectional study evaluated 111 chronic kidney disease patients (estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 34.7±16.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 57±11.4 years, 60% male, 24% 
      diabetics). Ventricular arrhythmia was assessed by 24-hour electrocardiogram. Left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (echocardiogram), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring, and coronary artery calcification (multi-slice computed tomography) and 
      laboratory parameters were also evaluated. RESULTS: Ventricular arrhythmia was found 
      in 35% of the patients. Non-controlled hypertension was observed in 21%, absence of 
      systolic decency in 29%, left ventricular hypertrophy in 27%, systolic dysfunction 
      in 10%, and coronary artery calcification in 49%. Patients with ventricular 
      arrhythmia were older (p<0.001), predominantly men (p = 0.009), had higher estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.03) and hemoglobin (p = 0.005), and lower intact 
      parathyroid hormone (p = 0.024) and triglycerides (p = 0.011) when compared to 
      patients without ventricular arrhythmia. In addition, a higher left ventricular mass 
      index (p = 0.002) and coronary calcium score (p = 0.002), and a lower ejection 
      fraction (p = 0.001) were observed among patients with ventricular arrhythmia. In 
      the multiple logistic regression analysis, aging, increased hemoglobin levels and 
      reduced ejection fraction were independently related to the presence of ventricular 
      arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular arrhythmia is prevalent in nondialyzed chronic 
      kidney disease patients. Age, hemoglobin levels and ejection fraction were the 
      factors associated with ventricular arrhythmia in these patients.

TI  - Correlates of osteoprotegerin and association with aortic pulse wave velocity in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2612-9
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03910411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
      resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and 
      stiffness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured in 
      351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic 
      Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured 
      by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression 
      was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave 
      velocity. RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female 
      gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was 
      not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum 
      phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with 
      concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for 
      demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors 
      such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, 
      presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or 
      after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness 
      independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation.

TI  - Comparison of the effects of novel vitamin D receptor analog VS-105 and paricalcitol

AB  - When using vitamin D, the most important clinical problems are hypercalcemia, 
      hyperphosphatemia, and vascular calcification. VS-105 is a novel vitamin D receptor 
      (VDR) analog. In the present study, we compared the effects of VS-105 and 
      paricalcitol on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) in a CKD rat 
      model. We used male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and performed 5/6 nephrectomy at 8-9 
      weeks. At 10 weeks, the rats were classified into five groups and administered 
      vehicle, low-dose paricalcitol (LP, 0.1μg/kg), high-dose paricalcitol (HP, 
      0.3μg/kg), low-dose VS-105 (LV, 0.2μg/kg), and high-dose VS-105 (HV, 0.6 μg/kg) 
      three times a week for 10 weeks. There were no significant differences in blood 
      pressure or renal function among the five groups. Alhough serum calcium levels were 
      comparable between the LP and LV groups, they were higher in the HP group than in 
      the HV group. Serum phosphate levels were higher in the paricalcitol-treated groups 
      than in the VS-105-treated groups and paticularly higher in the HP group than in the 
      other groups. The urinary excretion of phosphate was greater in the VS-105-treated 
      groups than in the paricalcitol-treated groups. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
      levels decreased and serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) levels were elevated 
      after administering paricalcitol and VS-105; however, serum FGF23 levels were 
      remarkably elevated in the paricalcitol-treated groups. Further biochemical analyses 
      revealed that the calcium content of the aorta was higher in the 
      paricalcitol-treated groups than in the VS-105-treated group. VDR and Klotho 
      expression in the kidney was significantly higher in the VS-105-treated groups than 
      in the paricalcitol-treated groups although both agents increased these expressions. 
      Our data suggest that VS-105 had a lesser effect on CKD-MBD than paricalcitol except 
      in the case of serum PTH levels. The mechanism appears to be associated with the 
      difference in VDR and Klotho expression.

TI  - Evaluation of serum fetuin-A relationships with biochemical parameters in patients 
      on hemodialysis.
PG  - 304-308

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complications associated with atherosclerosis in dialysis patients are 
      attracting attention. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that 
      inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation and outcome in 
      dialysis patients. In this study, the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration 
      and biochemical parameters in patients on hemodialysis was investigated. METHODS: 
      Forty hemodialysis patients, 22 men and 18 women, aged 57 +/- 12 years; and 20 
      controls, 10 men and 10 women, aged 50 +/- 10 years, participated in this study. We 
      measured serum fetuin-A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biochemical 
      parameters of serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphate, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein (a), brain 
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hemoglobin, 
      and hematocrit in whole blood were also measured before starting dialysis sessions. 
      Other parameters included the cardio ankle vascular index, age, mean arterial 
      pressure, total weekly urea clearance (Kt/V), smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), 
      and duration of dialysis. These variables were included in simple regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: Levels of serum fetuin-A in the hemodialysis patients (331 +/- 55 
      microg/ml) were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (361 +/- 55 
      microg/ml; P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between serum fetuin-A levels 
      and duration of dialysis (r = -0.37, P < 0.01), BNP (r = -0.37, P < 0.001), and 
      hsCRP (r = -0.40, P < 0.01), and a positive association with serum albumin (r = 
      0.31, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that a low fetuin-A level is a 
      useful predictor of malnutrition and inflammation, as well as being a useful 
      predictor of the cardiac failure caused by an increased ventricular load in 
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Peripheral vascular calcification in long-haemodialysis patients: associated factors 
      and survival consequences.
PG  - 948-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with 
      numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension 
      and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD 
      patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of 
      sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and 
      effects on the 1-year survival rate. METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre 
      using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and 
      extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to 
      their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological 
      data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, 
      beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year 
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the 
      centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects 
      were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 
      months (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l 
      dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients 
      were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were 
      classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, 
      more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 
      'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and 
      low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
      FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a 
      score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to 
      patients with a 0 score. CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high 
      prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis 
      strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic 
      factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure 
      and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association 
      with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The 
      harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and 
      optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD 
      patients.

TI  - Association of fetuin-A with mitral annular calcification and aortic stenosis among 
      persons with coronary heart disease: data from the Heart and Soul Study.
PG  - 2533-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a multifunctional hepatic secretory protein that inhibits 
      dystrophic vascular and valvular calcification. Lower serum fetuin-A concentrations 
      are associated with valvular calcification in persons with end-stage renal disease. 
      Whether fetuin-A is associated with valvular calcification in other patient 
      populations is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the associations among 
      serum fetuin-A concentrations, mitral annular calcification, and aortic stenosis in 
      970 ambulatory persons with coronary heart disease and without severe kidney 
      disease. The presence or absence of mitral annular calcification and aortic stenosis 
      was determined by transthoracic echocardiography. The subjects' mean age was 66 
      years; 81% were men; 189 (20%) had mitral annular calcification; and 79 (8%) had 
      aortic stenosis. Participants were categorized by tertiles of fetuin-A 
      concentrations. Those within the highest fetuin-A tertile had significantly lower 
      odds of mitral annular calcification compared with the lowest tertile (adjusted odds 
      ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.77; P=0.002); this association was 
      similar regardless of diabetes status (P for interaction=0.34). In contrast, the 
      association of fetuin-A with aortic stenosis was modified by the presence or absence 
      of diabetes mellitus (P for interaction=0.03). Among participants without diabetes, 
      the highest fetuin-A tertile had a significantly lower odds of aortic stenosis 
      compared with the lowest tertile (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.15 to 0.92; P=0.03), whereas among participants with diabetes, no 
      statistically significant association was observed between fetuin-A and aortic 
      stenosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 4.63; P=0.49). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with coronary heart disease, we observed an inverse 
      association of fetuin-A and mitral annular calcification. An inverse association 
      also was observed between fetuin-A and aortic stenosis among participants without 
      diabetes mellitus. Fetuin-A may represent an important inhibitor of dystrophic 
      calcification in persons with coronary heart disease.

TI  - Serum Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase-5b Levels are Associated with the Severity 
      and Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.
PG  - 1058-1068
LID - 10.5551/jat.39339 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are 
      specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated 
      with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the severity 
      of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in 
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on 
      coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 71 CAD 
      patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) and 28 age- and gender- 
      matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker 
      of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the 
      extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were 
      measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were classified into quartiles. 
      RESULTS: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in 
      healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and 
      Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were 
      associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear 
      regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or 
      the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b 
      level. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly 
      associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary 
      atherosclerosis in CAD patients.

TI  - R-568 reduces ectopic calcification in a rat model of chronic kidney disease-mineral 
      bone disorder (CKD-MBD).
PG  - 2371-7
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), a newly defined 
      disorder in patients with CKD, describes the interacting triad of (1) biochemical 
      abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH), (2) 
      extraskeletal calcification and (3) abnormal bone. METHODS: We studied the effects 
      of the calcimimetic R-568, R-568 with calcium (R-568 + Ca) or calcium (Ca) alone 
      compared with control CKD rats on this triad in the Cy/+ male rat, a model of 
      progressive CKD that spontaneously develops CKD-MBD on a normal phosphorus diet. 
      Animals were treated for either 14 or 18 weeks beginning at 20 weeks of age (34-week 
      and 38-week animals, respectively). RESULTS: The results demonstrated similar 
      efficacy of R-568, R-568 + Ca and Ca in lowering PTH levels. R-568 alone lowered 
      plasma calcium compared to control over time, but increased phosphorus compared to 
      control early in the course of the disease, but not at 38 weeks. Animals treated 
      with Ca alone or R-568 + Ca had lower phosphorus levels; the Ca alone group had 
      elevated Ca levels. Bone volume improved in the calcium-treated groups. In contrast, 
      arterial and cardiac calcification worsened by most assessments in the R-568 + Ca 
      and Ca alone treated animals compared with R-568 alone whereas R-568 alone treatment 
      showed beneficial effects on most sites of extraskeletal calcification. CONCLUSION: 
      Thus, R-568, with or without Ca, improved the biochemical abnormalities of 
      hyperparathyroidism but with higher and lower calcium levels, respectively, compared 
      with controls. However, R-568 + Ca had more dramatic improvement in bone volume, but 
      more extraskeletal calcification than R-568 alone. This complexity demonstrates that 
      treatment of one component of CKD-MBD may lead to undesirable effects on other 
      components.

TI  - The use of cinacalcet hinders the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma in a chronic 
      dialysis patient: a case report.
PG  - 315
LID - 10.1186/s12882-017-0733-0 [doi]
LID - 315
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common complication in 
      patients receiving chronic dialysis therapy. Although cinacalcet can control 
      parathyroid function and bone turnover, preventing ectopic calcification remains 
      challenging. Cinacalcet can also suppress PTH secretion due to parathyroid carcinoma 
      in the same way as it does for parathyroid hyperplasia in the uremic condition. We 
      present a case of parathyroid carcinoma partially controlled by cinacalcet, in which 
      tumorous calcinosis was successfully resolved by total parathyroidectomy. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A female patient in her forties who had received dialysis for 12 years 
      was referred to our hospital for painful ectopic calcifications on her right hip 
      joint and both knees. Although she had been treated with alfacalcidol and cinacalcet 
      for 2 years, this therapy had been discontinued 6 months earlier as a result of 
      hypercalcemia. The patient exhibited normocalcemia (2.37 mmol/L) and 
      hyperphosphatemia (2.42 mmol/L) with elevated intact parathyroid hormone 
      (707,000 μg/L). Ultrasonography revealed an enlarged parathyroid gland on the left 
      lower side of the thyroid gland. The otolaryngologist surgeons had to perform an en 
      bloc excision to remove this parathyroid gland because of tight adhesions. 
      Histological examination revealed that parathyroid cells had invaded the surrounding 
      skeletal muscle through fibrous capsules, consistent with parathyroid carcinoma. Her 
      joint pain disappeared 2 weeks after parathyroidectomy, and the tumorous calcinosis 
      had largely resolved after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare 
      cause of hyperparathyroidism in end-stage kidney disease. Our case indicates that 
      the use of cinacalcet hinders the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma in a chronic 
      dialysis patient. When uncontrolled hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphathemia develop 
      during cinacalcet administration, parathyroidectomy should be considered to prevent 
      a vicious exacerbation of ectopic calcification.

TI  - The effect of immunosuppressive treatment on arterial stiffness and matrix Gla 
      protein levels in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 491-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In this 
      study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian 
      Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal transplant 
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or 
      mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial 
      stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, 
      Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein (MGP) 
      concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). 
      RESULTS: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. Mean 
      age was 37.9 ± 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were female. Age, gender, graft 
      functions and follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index was 
      15.2 ± 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 ± 14.0% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There was no 
      difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between groups. Arterial 
      stiffness was positively correlated with age, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria. MGP levels were higher in the mTORi 
      group but were not predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSION: 
      Rather than specific immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional risk factors, 
      blood pressure and proteinuria are the most important predictors for arterial 
      stiffness in renal transplant patients.

TI  - A low fractional excretion of Phosphate/Fgf23 ratio is associated with severe 
      abdominal Aortic calcification in stage 3 and 4 kidney disease patients.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution 
      to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4. 
      METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were 
      studied in 178 patients. RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated 
      positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and 
      also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). 
      Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with 
      reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients 
      with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in 
      patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic 
      response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis 
      confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with 
      AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the 
      chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI 
      remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly 
      increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 
      associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin levels predict cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and 
      deterioration of kidney function in type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
PG  - 2100-7
LID - 10.1007/s00125-008-1123-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The bone-related peptide osteoprotegerin is produced by vascular 
      cells and is involved in the process of vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the predictive value of plasma levels of osteoprotegerin in 
      relation to mortality, cardiovascular events and deterioration in kidney function in 
      patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This prospective observational follow-up 
      study included 397 type 1 diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (243 
      men; age [mean+/-SD] 42.1 +/- 10.6 years, duration of diabetes 28.3 +/- 9.9 years, 
      GFR 67 +/- 28 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(2)) and a group of 176 patients with longstanding 
      type 1 diabetes and persistent normoalbuminuria (105 men; age 42.6 +/- 9.7 years, 
      duration of diabetes 27.6 +/- 8.3 years). RESULTS: The median (range) follow-up 
      period was 11.3 (0.0-12.9) years. Among patients with diabetic nephropathy, 
      individuals with high osteoprotegerin levels (fourth quartile) had significantly 
      higher all-cause mortality than patients with low levels (first quartile) 
      (covariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.00 [1.24-7.27]). High osteoprotegerin levels 
      also predicted cardiovascular mortality (covariate-adjusted HR 4.88 [1.57-15.14]). 
      Furthermore, patients with high osteoprotegerin levels had significantly higher risk 
      of progression to end-stage renal disease than patients with low levels 
      (covariate-adjusted HR 4.32 [1.45-12.87]). In addition, patients with high levels of 
      plasma osteoprotegerin had an elevated rate of decline in GFR. 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: High levels of osteoprotegerin predict all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, high 
      levels of osteoprotegerin predict deterioration of kidney function towards end-stage 
      renal disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High serum calcium-phosphate levels are associated with 
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Recent studies have demonstrated this relationship also in subjects with 
      normal kidney function. Our aim was to examine whether calcium-phosphate metabolism 
      is associated with the presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 
      asymptomatic and apparently healthy individuals. METHODS: Serum samples from 1088 
      randomly recruited middle-aged men and women without known CVD and diabetes (DM), 
      from the general population, were analysed for total calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). CAC was measured by a non-contrast 
      cardiac CT scan and categorised into four groups: 0, 1-99, 100-399, ≥400 Agatston 
      units. The association of calcium-phosphate metabolism with CAC was evaluated by a 
      multiple ordered logistic regression model. All the multiple regression analyses 
      were performed in the entire cohort as well as in men and women separately. RESULTS: 
      In the study population, 96% of the serum calcium values, 93% of the PTH values, 90% 
      of the phosphate values, and only 64% of the 25(OH)D values were placed within the 
      normal range. In men, the odds of being in a higher CAC category, i.e. having more 
      severe CAC, increased by 30% when serum calcium concentration increased by 
      0.1 mmol/l (95% CI: 1.04-1.61, p = 0.019), independently of traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors. In women, no significant association between serum 
      calcium and CAC was identified (OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.81-1.21, p = 0.91). Neither 
      phosphate, PTH nor 25(OH)D was significantly associated with CAC in men, in women or 
      when performed in the entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Serum calcium, even with values 
      within normal range and independent of traditional risk factors, was significantly 
      associated with CAC in asymptomatic and apparently healthy middle-aged men, but not 
      in women.

TI  - Progressive vascular calcification over 2 years is associated with arterial 
      stiffening and increased mortality in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1241-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an 
      important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
      cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
      calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 
      134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial 
      femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave 
      velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
      baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. 
      Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients 
      with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The 
      hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who 
      were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
      calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta 
      blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated 
      with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 
      patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in 
      calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk 
      factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease 
      and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification 
      over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness 
      and mortality.

TI  - Relationship between aortic pulse wave velocity, selected proinflammatory cytokines, 
      and vascular calcification parameters in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 142-8
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32836569c7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification and arterial stiffening are cardiovascular risk 
      factors among chronic kidney disease patients. Elevated aortic pulse wave velocity 
      (AoPWV) is an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular morbidity and 
      mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between 
      inflammatory and vascular calcification parameters and arterial wall stiffness in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The study included 57 patients (27 women and 30 men) aged from 19 to 75 
      years (mean age 53 ± 13), treated by peritoneal dialysis during 4-100 months (mean 
      30.4 months). The concentrations of albumin, lipids, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, 
      high-sensitive C-reactive protein, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), 
      osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), fibroblast growth factor 23, fetuin A, 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total calcium (Ca), and phosphates (Pi) were measured. 
      AoPWV was performed using a tonometric method, common carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CCA-IMT) by ultrasonography evaluation, and calcium scoring (CaSc) with 
      multirow spiral computed tomography (MSCT). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, AoPWV 
      correlated negatively with osteocalcin (R = -0.37; P = 0.005) and positively with 
      OPG (R = 0.41; P = 0.002). Additionally, AoPWV was significantly positively 
      associated with inflammatory parameters: IL-6 (R = 0.35; P = 0.009), TGF-β1 
      (R = 0.27; P = 0.047), and white blood cell (WBC) count (R = 0.33; P = 0.01). There 
      were also positive correlations between AoPWV and imaging data: CCA-IMT (R = 0.32; 
      P = 0.02) and CaSc (R = 0.38; P = 0.004). AoPWV did not correlate with calcium, 
      phosphate, Ca × Pi index, or iPTH concentration. After multiple adjustments, 
      osteocalcin was the only significant predictor of AoPWV. In logistic regression 
      adjusted for age, hypertension, and mean arterial pressure at AoPWV evaluation, only 
      osteocalcin was significantly associated with high (above median) AoPWV values [odds 
      ratio 0.96 (0.92-0.99) per unit increase in osteocalcin]. CONCLUSION: OPG 
      concentration and some inflammatory markers (WBC count, IL-6, TGF-β1) influenced the 
      severity of arterial wall stiffness in CKD patients. Measurement of osteocalcin 
      seems to be the best predictor of AoPWV.

TI  - Magnesium Modifies the Impact of Calcitriol Treatment on Vascular Calcification in 
      Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 451-62
LID - 10.1124/jpet.115.228106 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly treated with vitamin D analogs, 
      such as calcitriol. Recent epidemiologic evidence revealed a significant interaction 
      between vitamin D and magnesium, since an inverse relationship between vitamin D 
      levels and mortality mainly occurs in patients with a high magnesium intake. The aim 
      of the study was to assess the mechanisms involved by determining whether magnesium 
      alone or combined with calcitriol treatments differentially impacts vascular 
      calcification (VC) in male Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD. Treatment 
      with moderate doses of calcitriol (80 μg/kg) suppressed parathyroid hormone to near 
      or slightly below control levels. Given alone, this dose of calcitriol increased the 
      prevalence of VC; however, when magnesium was given in combination, the severity of 
      calcification was attenuated in the abdominal aorta (51% reduction), iliac (44%), 
      and carotid arteries (46%) compared with CKD controls. The decreases in vascular 
      calcium content were associated with a 20-50% increase in vascular magnesium. 
      Calcitriol treatment alone significantly decreased TRPM7 protein (↓ to ∼11%), 
      whereas the combination treatment increased both mRNA (1.7×) and protein (6.8×) 
      expression compared with calcitriol alone. In summary, calcitriol increased VC in 
      certain conditions, but magnesium prevented the reduction in TRPM7 and reduced the 
      severity of VC, thereby increasing the bioavailable magnesium in the vascular 
      microenvironment. These findings suggest that modifying the adverse effect profile 
      of calcitriol with magnesium may be a plausible approach to benefiting the 
      increasing number of CKD patients being prescribed calcitriol.

      387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. 
      Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared 
      with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L 
      vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients 
      had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 
      48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), 
      with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with 
      increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, 
      p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and 
      total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In 
      univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of 
      all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those 
      untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the 
      significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In 
      hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit 
      ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and 
      increased mortality.

TI  - Associations of epicardial fat with coronary calcification, insulin resistance, 
      inflammation, and fibroblast growth factor-23 in stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epicardial fat, quantified in a single multi-slice computed tomography 
      (MSCT) slice, is a reliable estimate of total epicardial fat volume (EFV). We sought 
      to determine risk factors for EFV detected in a single-slice MSCT measurement 
      (ssEFV) in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Our primary objective 
      was to determine the association between ssEFV and coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC). METHODS: 94 pre-dialysis stage 3-5 CKD patients underwent MSCT to measure 
      ssEFV and CAC. ssEFV was quantified at the level of the left main coronary artery. 
      Measures of inflammation, traditional and kidney-related cardiovascular disease risk 
      factors were collected. RESULTS: Mean age: 63.7 ± 14 years, 56% male, 39% had 
      diabetes, and mean eGFR: 25.1 ± 11.9 mL/min/1.73 m2. Mean ssEFV was 5.03 ± 2.4 cm3. 
      By univariate analysis, body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.53; P = <0.0001), abdominal 
      obesity (r = 0.51; P < 0.0001), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (r = - 
      0.39; P = <0.0001), insulin resistance (log homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (log HOMA-IR)) (r = 0.38, P = 0.001), log interleukin-6 (IL-6) (r = 0.34; 
      P = 0.001), and log urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) (r = 0.30, P = 0.004) 
      demonstrated the strongest associations with ssEFV. Log coronary artery 
      calcification (log CAC score) (r = 0.28, P = 0.006), and log fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (log FGF-23) (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) were also correlated with ssEFV. By 
      linear regression, log CAC score (beta =0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      0.01-0.80; P = 0.045), increasing levels of IL-6 (beta = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.38 - 1.61; 
      P = 0.002), abdominal obesity (beta = 1.86; 95% CI, 0.94 - 2.8; P < 0.0001), lower 
      HDL cholesterol (beta = -2.30; 95% CI, - 3.68 to -0.83; P = 0.002) and albuminuria 
      (log UACR, beta = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.4; P = 0.01) were risk factors for 
      increased ssEFV. CONCLUSIONS: In stage 3-5 CKD, coronary calcification and IL-6 and 
      were predictors of ssEFV. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by 
      which epicardial fat may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary disease, 
      particularly in the CKD population.

PG  - 379-86
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9655-9 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 
      contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor 
      activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic 
      mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using the 
      SM22α promoter (SM22α-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old male 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium levels but 
      lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and gender-matched 
      wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent of weight) of the 
      leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not significantly different. No 
      significant differences in these parameters were observed in female mice. 
      Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits in the aortic roots of 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic differentiation and 
      mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were 
      isolated and cultured. Results showed that SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs had higher 
      baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but not baseline matrix calcification. 
      When induced by the PKA agonist forskolin, ALP activity was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( 
      tg ) than in WT SMCs. Real-time RT-qPCR revealed higher baseline expression of ALP 
      and ankylosis genes but lower osteoprotegerin gene in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. 
      Matrix mineralization induced by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in 
      SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP inhibitor 
      levamisole abolished forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not inorganic 
      phosphate-induced matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that RANKL 
      overexpression in the vasculature may promote mineralization potential.

TI  - Risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications in non-diabetic Caucasian 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 161-8
LID - 10.1159/000221064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dialysis patients display an increased mortality which is 
      associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Diabetes mellitus and ethnicity are 
      known factors that affect the extent of cardiovascular calcifications. However, most 
      studies have investigated mixed cohorts with diabetics and/or mixed ethnicity. 
      METHODS: Cardiovascular calcifications were assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian 
      haemodialysis patients by the semiquantitative Adragao calcification score (X-ray 
      pelvis and hands) and a novel composite calcification score encompassing the Adragao 
      score as well as calcifications detected by X-ray of the fistula arm, 
      echocardiography of heart valves and carotid ultrasound. RESULTS: Using multivariate 
      analysis, age, male gender, dialysis vintage, lower Kt/V, calcium-phosphate product, 
      smoking and high-sensitivity CRP were independent risk factors for cardiovascular 
      calcifications as assessed by the Adragao or the composite score. Pulse wave 
      velocity was independently related to both calcification scores. Body mass index, 
      cholesterol, triglycerides, iPTH and serum levels of fetuin-A and uncarboxylated 
      matrix Gla protein were not associated with cardiovascular calcifications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients, age, 
      male gender, dialysis vintage, smoking, calcium-phosphate product, high-sensitivity 
      CRP and lower Kt/V were independent risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications. 
      Whether lowering the calcium-phosphate product and increasing dialysis efficiency 
      can reduce cardiovascular calcifications in dialysis patients remains to be 
      determined.

TI  - Association between pentosidine and arteriosclerosis in patients receiving 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 48-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) 
      accumulate in arteriosclerotic lesions, playing and important role in the 
      development and progression of arteriosclerosis. A chemical quantification method 
      using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been established to 
      determine pentosidine levels in these products. Some studies reported that the 
      abdominal aorta calcification index (ACI), obtained by computed tomography (CT), was 
      useful for noninvasively diagnosing arteriosclerosis and determining its severity. 
      In the present study, we measured the ACI and plasma pentosidine in patients 
      receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and investigated the association between 
      arteriosclerosis and pentosidine. METHODS: In 73 patients receiving maintenance 
      hemodialysis (43 men; 30 women), we determined the ACI, and investigated the 
      association of the ACI with plasma total pentosidine, total cholesterol, 
      triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL) cholesterol, serum creatinine, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as well as the 
      product of serum calcium and serum phosphorus, duration of dialysis, and age. 
      RESULTS: The ACI did not correlate with total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL 
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, serum creatinine, PTH, or the product of serum calcium 
      and serum phosphorus. Age, duration of dialysis, and plasma total pentosidine 
      correlated with the ACI: (y = -33.12 + 0.913x; r = 0.407; P < 0.01), (y = 13.94 + 
      0.403x; r = 0.488; P < 0.01), and (y = 14.13 + 0.630x; r = 0.365; P < 0.01), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that pentosidine may be associated with 
      arteriosclerotic development in hemodialysis patients. It has been suggested that 
      advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) accumulate in arteriosclerotic lesions, 
      playing an important role in the development and progression of arteriosclerosis. A 
      chemical quantification method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
      has been established to determine pentosidine levels in these products. Some studies 
      reported that the abdominal aorta calcification index (ACI), obtained by computed 
      tomography (CT), was useful for noninvasively diagnosing arteriosclerosis and 
      determining its severity. In the present study, we measured the ACI and plasma 
      pentosidine in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, and investigated the 
      association between arteriosclerosis and pentosidine.

TI  - Elevated osteoprotegerin is associated with all-cause mortality in CKD stage 4 and 5 
      patients in addition to vascular calcification.
PG  - 3157-62
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
      understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
      importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular 
      calcification (VC), on survival. METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis 
      (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors 
      completed 40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the 
      superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard 
      clinical biochemical analysis. RESULTS: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had 
      died (27 men and 4 women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The 
      majority of deaths were in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD 
      subjects. The outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate 
      logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 
      0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 0.26 
      (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSION: We 
      have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in CKD stages 4 and 5 
      over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, independent of CRP, is 
      also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated; 
      however, it is likely that they are associated with vascular damage through 
      mechanisms in addition to VC.

TI  - Detection of coronary and peripheral artery calcification in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 3208-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent of 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished to 
      determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would assist in 
      identifying patients positive for CAC. METHODS: CAC was detected by multi-slice 
      computed tomography and PAC was detected by plain foot radiography. Study population 
      was 112 patients, 54 with diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart 
      disease. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5% with and without diabetes, 
      respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more vessels 
      affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same risk for CAC. 
      In patients with diabetes, age was the unique explanatory variable for detecting the 
      presence of CAC, while age and smoking history predicted severity. In patients 
      without diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the presence of CAC, while parathyroid 
      hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC was 63 and 12% in subjects with and 
      without diabetes. PAC detected by foot radiography was not an adequate 
      alternative-screening marker for identifying patients with CAC. CONCLUSIONS: CAC is 
      common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in men and women with diabetes.

TI  - The circulating inactive form of matrix gla protein is a surrogate marker for 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease: a preliminary report.
PG  - 568-75
LID - 10.2215/CJN.07081009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) acts as a 
      calcification inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. The present study was performed to (1) 
      determine plasma levels of the inactive, dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated MGP 
      (dp-ucMGP) in a cohort of patients at different stages of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and (2) evaluate the association between dp-ucMGP levels on one hand and 
      aortic calcification and mortality on the other. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: 107 patients (67 +/- 13 years; 60% male; 32% at CKD stages 2 to 3, 31% 
      at stages 4 to 5, 37% at stage 5D) were assayed for dp-ucMGP and underwent 
      multislice spiral computed tomography scans to quantify aortic calcification at 
      baseline. They were prospectively monitored for mortality. RESULTS: Plasma dp-ucMGP 
      levels augmented progressively with CKD stage, with a significant difference from 
      CKD stage 4. CKD stage, hemoglobin, age, and coumarin use were independently 
      associated with plasma dp-ucMGP levels. Furthermore, plasma dp-ucMGP and age were 
      positively and independently associated with the aortic calcification score. During 
      follow-up (802 +/- 311 days), 34 patients died (20 from cardiovascular events). In a 
      crude analysis, [plasma dp-ucMGP] > 921 pM was associated with overall mortality; 
      this association was lost after adjusting for both age and the calculated propensity 
      score. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma dp-ucMGP increased progressively in a CKD setting and was 
      associated with the severity of aortic calcification. Plasma dp-ucMGP could thus be 
      a surrogate marker for vascular calcification in CKD.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and associated factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 395-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and 
      is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular 
      calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, 
      and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in 
      a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the 
      recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative 
      guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a 
      sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level 
      (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' 
      characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 
      and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; 
      and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% 
      and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, 
      and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 
      6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant 
      treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as 
      a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 
      66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 
      21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a 
      higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < 
      .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage 
      levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, 
      normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip 
      bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were 
      significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol 
      deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated 
      factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher 
      intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy 
      of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D 
      supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need 
      for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and 
      the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

TI  - Cardiac vascular calcification and QT interval in ESRD patients: is there a link?
PG  - 451-9
AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
      between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
      studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 +/- 
      27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 
      years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good 
      mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 
      4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 
      mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than 
      CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in 
      both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification 
      than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher 
      or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), 
      frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), 
      parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). 
      The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores 
      (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients 
      with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in 
      both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, 
      age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium 
      x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
      of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac 
      calcification in uraemic patients.

      Histomorphometry.

LID - 10.2215/CJN.04810515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) measurements can distinguish 
      between cortical and trabecular bone density in vivo. High-resolution CTs assess 
      both bone volume and density in the same compartment, thus potentially yielding 
      information regarding bone mineralization as well. The relationship between bone 
      histomorphometric parameters of skeletal mineralization and bone density from 
      microcomputed tomography (μCT) measurements of bone cores from patients on dialysis 
      has not been assessed. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Bone cores 
      from 68 patients with ESRD (age =13.9±0.5 years old; 50% men) and 14 controls (age 
      =15.3±3.8 years old; 50% men) obtained as part of research protocols between 1983 
      and 2006 were analyzed by bone histomorphometry and μCT. RESULTS: Bone 
      histomorphometric diagnoses in the patients were normal to high bone turnover in 
      76%, adynamic bone in 13%, and osteomalacia in 11%. Bone formation rate did not 
      correlate with any μCT determinations. Bone volume measurements were highly 
      correlated between bone histomorphometry and μCT (bone volume/tissue volume between 
      the two techniques: r=0.70; P<0.001, trabecular thickness and trabecular separation: 
      r=0.71; P<0.001, and r=0.56; P<0.001, respectively). Osteoid accumulation as 
      determined by bone histomorphometry correlated inversely with bone mineral density 
      as assessed by μCT (osteoid thickness: r=-0.32; P=0.01 and osteoid volume: r=-0.28; 
      P=0.05). By multivariable analysis, the combination of bone mineral density and bone 
      volume (as assessed by μCT) along with parathyroid hormone and calcium levels 
      accounted for 38% of the variability in osteoid volume (by histomorphometry). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Measures of bone volume can be accurately assessed with μCT. Bone 
      mineral density is lower in patients with excessive osteoid accumulation and higher 
      in patients with adynamic, well mineralized bone. Thus, bone mineralization may be 
      accurately assessed by μCT of bone biopsy cores. Additional studies are warranted to 
      define the value of high-resolution CT in the prediction of bone mineralization in 
      vivo.

TI  - Heart valve calcifications in patients with end-stage renal disease: analysis for 
      risk factors.
PG  - 494-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of valve calcification (VC) in end-stage renal disease 
      patients is high and information regarding risk factors is scarce. Our aims were to 
      determine the prevalence of VC in our maintenance haemodialysis (HD) population and 
      to examine some possible aetiologic factors for its occurrence. METHODS: We studied 
      90 patients (47 women) on maintenance HD for more than 12 months. An M-mode 
      two-dimensional echocardiogram was carried out to evaluate mitral, aortic VC and 
      ventricular geometry. We calculated mean daily calcium intake for the phosphate 
      intestinal chelaing in the previous year to echocardiogram date and also mean values 
      from previous year of Ca, PO4, Ca x PO4, parathyroid hormone, lipide profile, 
      nutritional and inflammatory marquers. Finally consumption of calcium and 
      alfacalcidol was also noted. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (40%) presented with VC. 
      Patients with VC were older and showed higher levels of serum calcium (92.00 +/- 
      7.54 vs 89.27 +/- 6.86 mg/L, P = 0.04), phosphorus (69.70 +/- 18.33 vs 44.90 +/- 
      12.43 mg/L, P < 0.0001), Ca x P product (6164.97 +/- 1797.64 vs 4024.70 +/- 1066.40 
      mg(2)/L(2), P < 0.0001) and poor ventricular geometry, as compared with patients 
      without VC. Moreover, they required higher doses of alfacalcidol for treating 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (0.43 +/- 0.60 vs 0.11 +/- 0.46 microg/day, P < 
      0.0001). CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study are consistent with a role of 
      altered calcium and phosphate metabolism in the pathogenesis of VC in HD patients.

TI  - The impact of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on coronary calcification 
      in pre-dialysis patients.
PG  - 2464-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death among 
      end-stage renal disease patients. There is evidence that coronary calcification is a 
      marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease and is predictive of cardiovascular 
      events, especially in patients on renal replacement therapy. It has recently been 
      suggested that CHD begins in the pre-dialysis period. However, data regarding 
      coronary calcification in this population is scarce. This study was aimed at 
      evaluating such coronary calcification and identifying related factors. METHODS: A 
      total of 96 chronic kidney disease out-patients who were not on dialysis were 
      included. Patients presenting neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory diseases were 
      excluded. Demographic characteristics, clinical profiles, laboratory test results 
      and multislice computed tomography scans were evaluated. RESULTS: The median age was 
      55 years (range 20-69 years), 67% were men and the median creatinine clearance was 
      37 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Coronary calcification, defined as a coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) >0 Agatston units (AU), was seen in 61 patients (median 
      89.1 AU, range 0.37-2299.3 AU). On average, these patients were older, more often 
      had diabetes, higher body mass indices and higher Framingham risk indices, as well 
      as presenting higher proteinuria, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), blood glucose 
      and triglyceride levels compared with those without calcification. Multiple logistic 
      regression analysis, adjusted for age and diabetes, identified iPTH and triglyceride 
      levels as independent determinants of calcification. Severe calcification (CACS >400 
      AU) was seen in 22 patients, who were also older and more frequently had a history 
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as having higher levels of phosphorus, 
      blood glucose and soluble Fas (sFas). Multiple logistic regression analysis, 
      adjusted for age and diabetes, identified phosphorus and sFas levels as independent 
      determinants of severe coronary calcification. CONCLUSION: Coronary calcification is 
      highly prevalent in pre-dialysis patients and correlates with traditional and 
      non-traditional risk factors for CVD.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in 
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly 
      recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels 
      of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study 
      investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with 
      all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc 
      survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 
      2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters 
      of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum 
      sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: 
      Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] 
      pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older 
      age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a 
      median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels 
      were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum 
      sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When 
      bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the 
      causal pathway.

TI  - Association of low serum fetuin A levels with poor arteriovenous access patency in 
      patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 720-7
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2010.06.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin A, a predictor of mortality in dialysis patients, is associated 
      with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      Whether it predicts arteriovenous (AV) access patency is unknown. This study aimed 
      to investigate the association between fetuin A and AV access patency in HD 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 238 
      prevalent HD patients (127 women and 111 men; mean age, 60 ± 12 years) were followed 
      up for AV access patency for 32 months. PREDICTORS: Tertiles of baseline circulating 
      fetuin A levels, corresponding to 0.15-0.25, 0.26-0.32, and 0.33-0.51 g/L. OUTCOME: 
      The major outcome was loss of unassisted AV access patency, defined as AV access 
      thrombosis or need for intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Fetuin A and other markers of 
      inflammation. RESULTS: 100 patients had loss of AV access patency (42%) on 
      follow-up. Patients in the lowest fetuin A tertile had the worst AV access patency 
      (log-rank test, χ(2) = 8.68; P = 0.01). Using Cox proportional hazards regression 
      with patients in the lowest fetuin A tertile as reference, patients in the 
      intermediate tertile had an HR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29-0.82), whereas those in the 
      highest fetuin A tertile had an HR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25-0.75) for loss of AV access 
      patency. Similarly, considering patients using AV fistulas or grafts separately, 
      patients in the highest fetuin A tertile had less risk of losing AV access patency 
      than patients in the other tertiles (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.19-0.84] for patients with 
      AV fistulas and HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.10-0.65] for patients with AV grafts). 
      LIMITATIONS: Focus on the patency of prevalent rather than new AV access in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin A deficiency is associated 
      with a higher risk of loss of AV access patency in either native AV fistulas or AV 
      grafts in HD patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification, systemic inflammation markers and mineral metabolism 
      in a peritoneal dialysis population.
PG  - c33-40
AB  - AIMS: To assess the prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD) patients and to determine whether comorbidities such as inflammation, 
      dyslipidemia and mineral metabolism disorders correlate with its development. 
      METHODS: Forty-nine PD patients (45% male; median age, 52 years) were submitted to 
      multislice computed tomography. Inflammatory markers, anti-oxidized LDL antibody, 
      calcium-phosphate balance and lipid profiles were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine 
      patients (59.2%) presented CAC (median calcium score, 234.7 Agatston units). 
      Patients with CAC were older than those without, more frequently presented a history 
      of coronary artery disease or hypertension and had lower HDL cholesterol levels, as 
      well as presenting higher levels of osteoprotegerin and LDL oxidation. The logistic 
      regression revealed that the independent determinants of CAC were age (odds ratio = 
      1.12; p = 0.006) and number of prescribed anti-hypertensive drugs (odds ratio = 
      2.38; p = 0.048). When the population was stratified by calcium score quartile, 
      soluble Fas levels were significantly higher in patients with severe calcification. 
      In patients younger than 45, CAC correlated positively with phosphorus levels (r = 
      0.52; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In PD patients, CAC is highly prevalent. Our results 
      indicate that conditions such as inflammation and mineral disturbances are 
      associated with its development.

AB  - Vascular calcification is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Medial layer vascular calcification, 
      which is recognized to be an active process (i.e. the transformation of vascular 
      smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells), is common in CKD patients. We have 
      recently reported the possibility of an interaction between elastin degradation and 
      medial layer vascular calcification. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which 
      induces the degradation of elastin, has been implicated in the elastic calcification 
      in arteries of dialysis patients; however, the precise mechanisms by which elastin 
      degradation interacts with the development of vascular calcification remain to be 
      studied. To clarify the mechanisms by which elastin degradation is involved in the 
      development of medial layer vascular calcification in the uremic milieu, we induced 
      aortic medial layer calcification in 5/6 nephrectomized uremic rats (male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats) fed a diet containing high phosphate (1.2%) and lactate (20%). 
      After 10 weeks, the rats were euthanized for the measurement of serum chemistry 
      profiles and histological analyses. The uremic rats showed significant increases in 
      blood pressure, serum creatinine, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels compared 
      with normal rats. Von Kossa staining showed medial layer aortic calcification in the 
      uremic rats. In calcified lesions, thin elastic lamellae were observed by elastin 
      staining, indicating that elastin degradation could occur in the area. Furthermore, 
      MMP-2 expression determined by immunohistochemistry was also observed in the same 
      area. Elastin degradation accompanied by MMP-2 expression might be involved in the 
      development of medial layer vascular calcification in uremic rats.

TI  - Aortic Artery and Cardiac Valve Calcification are Associated with Mortality in 
      Chinese Hemodialysis Patients: A 3.5 Years Follow-up.
PG  - 2764-71
LID - 10.4103/0366-6999.167315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was to investigate the relationship among aortic artery 
      calcification (AAC), cardiac valve calcification (CVC), and mortality in maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients. METHODS: All MHD patients in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital 
      in July 2011 were included. To follow up for 42 months, clinical data, predialysis 
      blood tests, echocardiography, and lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography results 
      were collected. Plasma FGF23 level was measured using a C-terminal assay. RESULTS: 
      Totally, 110 MHD patients were involved in this study. Of which, 64 (58.2%) patients 
      were male, the mean age was 55.2 ± 1.4 years old, and the median dialysis duration 
      was 29.85 (3.0-225.5) months. About 25.5% of the 110 MHD patients had CVC from 
      echocardiography while 61.8% of the patients had visible calcification of aorta from 
      lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography. After 42 months follow-up, 25 (22.7%) 
      patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with AAC or CVC had a 
      significant greater number of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths than those 
      without. In multivariate analyses, the presence of AAC was a significant factor 
      associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.149, P = 0.025) in 
      addition to lower albumin level and lower 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) level. The 
      presence of CVC was a significant factor associated with cardiovascular mortality 
      (HR: 3.800, P = 0.029) in addition to lower albumin level and lower 25(OH)D level. 
      CONCLUSION: Lateral lumbar X-ray plain radiography and echocardiography are simple 
      methods to detect AAC and CVC in dialysis patients. The presence of AAC and CVC was 
      independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by X-ray 
      and echocardiography could be a useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD 
      patients.

BTI - Hyperphosphataemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: Management of Hyperphosphataemia in 
      Patients with Stage 4 or 5 Chronic Kidney Disease
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It 
      is common and often exists together with other conditions, such as cardiovascular 
      disease and diabetes. The ‘National service framework for renal services’ adopted 
      the US ‘National Kidney Foundation kidney disease outcomes quality initiative’ 
      (NKF-KDOQI) classification of CKD. This classification divides CKD into 5 stages 
      according to the extent of a person’s loss of renal function. Stage 4 CKD is defined 
      by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m(2), and stage 5 by a 
      GFR of less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2). CKD progresses to these more advanced stages 
      in a small, but significant percentage of people. In 2010, the Health Survey for 
      England reported a prevalence of moderate to severe CKD (stages 3 to 5) of 6% in men 
      and 7% in women, as a percentage of the total population in England. CKD stages 4 
      and 5 were reported at a prevalence of 1% or less. Although this figure might seem 
      small, it translates to a prevalence of up to 520,000 people in England alone. When 
      CKD stage 5 advances to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), some people progress to 
      renal replacement therapy (RRT). The UK Renal Registry reported that 49,080 adult 
      patients were receiving RRT in the UK at the end of 2009. Of these, 25,796 were 
      receiving RRT in the form of dialysis (a population sometimes classified CKD stage 
      5D). As kidney dysfunction advances, there is a higher risk of mortality and some 
      comorbidities become more severe. Hyperphosphataemia is one example of this, and 
      occurs because of insufficient filtering of phosphate from the blood by poorly 
      functioning kidneys. This means that a certain amount of the phosphate does not 
      leave the body in the urine, instead remaining in the blood at abnormally elevated 
      levels. High serum phosphate levels can directly and indirectly increase parathyroid 
      hormone secretion, leading to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Left 
      untreated, secondary hyperparathyroidism increases morbidity and mortality and may 
      lead to renal bone disease, with people experiencing bone and muscular pain, 
      increased incidence of fracture, abnormalities of bone and joint morphology, and 
      vascular and soft tissue calcification. For adults with stage 4 or 5 CKD who are not 
      on dialysis, the UK Renal Association guidelines recommend that serum phosphate be 
      maintained at between 0.9 and 1.5 mmol/l. For adults with stage 5 CKD who are on 
      dialysis, it is recommended that serum phosphate levels be maintained at between 1.1 
      and 1.7 mmol/l. Because of the improved removal of phosphate from the blood through 
      dialysis, adults on dialysis have different recommended levels to those with stage 4 
      or 5 CKD who are not on dialysis. For children and young people with stage 4 CKD, 
      the NKF-KDOQI guidelines and European guidelines on the prevention and treatment of 
      renal osteodystrophy recommend that serum phosphate be maintained within 
      age-appropriate limits. For those with stage 5 CKD, including those on dialysis, it 
      is recommended that serum phosphate levels be maintained at between 1.3 and 1.9 
      mmol/l for those aged 1–12 years, and between 1.1 and 1.8 mmol/l during adolescence. 
      Standard management of hyperphosphataemia involves the use of both pharmacological 
      and non-pharmacological interventions, as well as the provision of education and 
      support. However, there is wide variation between units and practices across the UK 
      in how these interventions are used. At the end of 2009, data from the UK Renal 
      Registry showed that only 61% of patients receiving haemodialysis and 70% of 
      patients receiving peritoneal dialysis achieved serum phosphate levels within the 
      recommended range. This, together with a rising prevalence of CKD, led to the 
      development of this clinical guideline on the management of hyperphosphataemia. The 
      guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug’s summary of product 
      characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. This guideline 
      recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing 
      authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that 
      use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full 
      responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give 
      consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be 
      documented. See the General Medical Council’s Good practice in prescribing and

TI  - Age-dependent parathormone levels and different CKD-MBD treatment practices of 
      dialysis patients in Hungary--results from a nationwide clinical audit.
PG  - 155
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Achieving target levels of laboratory parameters of bone and mineral 
      metabolism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is important but also difficult 
      in those living with end-stage kidney disease. This study aimed to determine if 
      there are age-related differences in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone 
      disorder (CKD-MBD) characteristics, including treatment practice in Hungarian 
      dialysis patients. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from a large cohort 
      of dialysis patients in Hungary. Patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis 
      were also included. The enrolled patients were allocated into two groups based on 
      their age (<65 years and ≥65 years). Characteristics of the age groups and 
      differences in disease-related (epidemiology, laboratory, and treatment practice) 
      parameters between the groups were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 5008 patients were 
      included in the analysis and the mean age was 63.4±14.2 years. A total of 47.2% of 
      patients were women, 32.8% had diabetes, and 11.4% were on peritoneal dialysis. 
      Diabetes (37.9% vs 27.3%), bone disease (42.9% vs 34.1%), and soft tissue 
      calcification (56.3% vs 44.7%) were more prevalent in the older group than the 
      younger group (p<0.001 for all). We found an inverse relationship between age and 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (p<0.001). Serum PTH levels were lower in patients 
      with diabetes compared with those without diabetes below 80 years (p<0.001). 
      Diabetes and age were independently associated with serum PTH levels (interaction: 
      diabetes × age groups, p=0.138). Older patients were more likely than younger 
      patients to achieve laboratory target ranges for each parameter (Ca: 66.9% vs 62.1%, 
      p<0.001; PO4: 52.6% vs 49.2%, p<0.05; and PTH: 50.6% vs 46.6%, p<0.01), and for 
      combined parameters (19.8% vs 15.8%, p<0.001). Older patients were less likely to 
      receive related medication than younger patients (66.9% vs 79.7%, p<0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of laboratory target ranges for bone and mineral 
      metabolism and clinical practice in CKD depends on the age of the patients. A 
      greater proportion of older patients met target criteria and received less 
      medication compared with younger patients.

TI  - The associations of fetuin-A with subclinical cardiovascular disease in 
      community-dwelling persons: the Rancho Bernardo Study.
PG  - 2372-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association of fetuin-A with 
      subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in community-living individuals. 
      BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A is a hepatic secretory protein that inhibits arterial calcium 
      deposition in vitro. Lower fetuin-A levels are associated with arterial 
      calcification and death in end-stage renal disease populations. The association of 
      fetuin-A with subclinical CVD in the general population is unknown. METHODS: Among 
      1,375 community-living individuals without prevalent clinical CVD, we measured 
      plasma fetuin-A concentrations. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was defined by 
      ankle brachial index <0.90, coronary artery calcification (CAC) was measured by 
      computed tomography, and common and internal intima-media thickness (cIMT) were 
      measured by carotid ultrasound. PAD was measured concurrent with fetuin-A, and CAC 
      and cIMT were measured 4.6 years (mean) later. RESULTS: Mean age was 70 ± 11 years, 
      and 64% were women. Fetuin-A levels were inversely associated with CAC severity. 
      When evaluated as CAC categories (0, 1 to 100, 101 to 300, >300) with ordinal 
      logistic regression, each SD higher fetuin-A was associated with 31% lower odds of 
      CAC severity (proportional odds ratio: 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 0.92; 
      p = 0.008) in models adjusted for demographic data, lifestyle factors, traditional 
      CVD risk factors, and kidney function. In contrast, no association of fetuin-A was 
      observed with PAD or high common or internal cIMT in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lower fetuin-A levels are independently associated with greater CAC severity but not 
      PAD or cIMT. If confirmed, fetuin-A might mark calcium deposition within the 
      vasculature but not atherosclerosis per se.

TI  - Severe asymptomatic coronary obstruction in chronic hemodialysed patient - a case 
      report.
PG  - 424-428
AB  - Introduction. Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent 
      predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on renal 
      replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class. Case report. We 
      report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known with CKD stage 5D 
      on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral disease, admitted for 
      progressive right leg pain. The physical examination detected right dorsalis pedis 
      artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry emphasized hypercalcemia, 
      hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, metabolic acidosis, 
      hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray of right shin highlighted 
      a vascular calcification with a "train track" aspect on the tibial-peroneal artery 
      trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low ray regime) showed calcium deposits 
      in coronary arteries walls. Legs arteriography and coronary angiography were 
      performed revealing multiple lesions on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing 
      of right coronary artery. The particularity of the case lies in the absence of 
      angina in a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant 
      angiographically stenosis of the coronary arteries were found and successful 
      endovascular therapy was performed. Conclusion. The broadening of the indication for 
      coronary angiography should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D 
      patients based on a risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base 
      imbalances, while considering their major influence on the structure and tone of 
      vascular walls thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Abbreviations.

TI  - Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium score: 
      comparison between transplantation and dialysis.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent 
      ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences 
      between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity 
      of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately 
      in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, 
      divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; 
      previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 
      mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 
      5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by 
      cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of 
      divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) 
      and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary 
      calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three 
      calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with 
      age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 
      0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a 
      correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other 
      markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression 
      analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and 
      C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most 
      predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age 
      and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
      condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as 
      compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition 
      proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower 
      prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating 
      role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary 
      calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value 
      to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular 
      lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

TI  - Calciphylaxis in a dialysis patient successfully treated with high-dose vitamin K 
      supplementation.
PG  - 528-529
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfx126 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis has high mortality. Vitamin K deficiency is common in haemodialysis 
      patients and may be a trigger for calciphylaxis due to its role in activating matrix 
      Gla protein (a tissue inhibitor of calcification). We report the case of a 
      43-year-old female haemodialysis patient who developed calciphylaxis. Two months 
      prior to the diagnosis she was found to have an undetectable plasma vitamin K 
      concentration. The calciphylaxis completely resolved with vitamin K supplementation 
      and an increase in haemodialysis frequency. She did not receive sodium thiosulphate 
      or bisphosphonates. Supplementation of vitamin K in deficient patients may improve 
      the outcome of this condition.

TI  - Hypoparathyroidism potentiates cardiovascular complications through disturbed 
      calcium metabolism: possible risk of vitamin D(3) analog administration in dialysis 
      patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Progressive cardiovascular calcification in dialysis patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious complication; however, the precise 
      mechanism remains uncertain. We tested whether metabolic calcium abnormalities and 
      hypoparathyroidism might have a correlation with cardiovascular complications in 
      ESRD patients. METHODS: A series of 48 ESRD patients with cardiovascular diseases 
      and/or congestive heart failure, aged 36-82 (61 +/- 12) years, 23 male and 25 
      female, were enrolled in this study. Serum total calcium (Ca, mmol/l), inorganic 
      phosphate (mmol/l), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, pg/ml) levels were 
      determined in all cases. RESULTS: Organic heart disease was confirmed in 28 patients 
      (58.3%), including 15 with coronary artery disease: 8 with aortic aneurysm, 8 with 
      stenotic valvular heart disease, 9 with excessive mitral annular calcification, 3 
      with dialysis cardiomyopathy, and 7 with obstructive arterial disease. Serum iPTH 
      measurement revealed hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) in 20 of 48 (41.7%) and 
      hyperthyroidism (iPTH >/=200) in 13 of 48 (27.1%) subjects. The 20 patients with low 
      iPTH had a higher prevalence of valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca level 
      corrected for serum albumin (2.70 +/- 0.30 in low iPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 in normal 
      iPTH, 2.35 +/- 0.20 in high iPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of vitamin D(3) 
      analog use (65% in low iPTH vs. 33% in normal iPTH and 46% in high iPTH, p = 0.078). 
      Moreover, corrected serum Ca exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with serum 
      iPTH: corrected Ca = -0.284x log (iPTH) + 3.021 (r = 0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis revealed diabetes and hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) as 
      risk factors for cardiovascular complications in ESRD. CONCLUSION: These results 
      suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in conjunction with vitamin D(3) 
      use might play an important role in cardiovascular complications of chronic dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Calciphylaxis is associated with hyperphosphatemia and increased osteopontin 
      expression by vascular smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 1267-76
AB  - Calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a fatal disease in dialysis 
      patients due to calcification of cutaneous blood vessels. The pathogenesis has been 
      attributed to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, recent studies evaluating 
      vascular calcification in nondialysis patients have found that the smooth muscle 
      cells play an active role, including production of the bone matrix protein 
      osteopontin. To examine the involvement of various clinical parameters and smooth 
      muscle cells of CUA, we performed a case-control analysis comparing 10 CUA patients 
      with our current dialysis patients. Available histologic sections were immunostained 
      for osteopontin, markers of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. 
      Compared with our current dialysis population, patients with CUA were more likely to 
      be obese, white, and female (P < 0.02). Comparison of laboratory values found CUA 
      patients with lower serum albumin, greater serum phosphorus, and greater calcium X 
      phosphorus product (P < 0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in the 
      concentration of PTH or calcium between the 2 groups. Immunostaining of calcified 
      blood vessels showed that all calcified vessels stained positive for osteopontin, 
      whereas all the noncalcifed vessels showed no osteopontin localization. Staining for 
      smooth muscle alpha-actin decreased in the medial layer with calcification, with 
      cells appearing to be sloughed off, leading to near occlusion of the vessel lumen. 
      Our case-control study demonstrates that hyperphosphatemia and an elevated calcium X 
      phosphorus product is associated with CUA. Histologic examination suggests that the 
      calcification is associated with increased expression of osteopontin by smooth 
      muscle cells.

TI  - Relationship between aortic valve sclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy in 
      chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 497-502
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification is a frequent finding in chronic 
      haemodialysis patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a significant 
      predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We 
      evaluated the influence of aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) on the development of LVH in 
      chronic haemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 82 consecutive patients (52 
      male, mean age 48 +/- 12 years) undergoing chronic haemodialysis treatment for > 1 
      year were subjected to echocardiography for the screening of AVS and the assessment 
      of transaortic flow velocity and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). The absence 
      (group 1, n = 42) and presence of AVS (group 2, n = 40) was established. The average 
      values of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure were obtained. Plasma calcium, 
      phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein, haemoglobin and lipid 
      levels were also measured. RESULTS: LVH was detected in 59 (72%) of the study 
      patients. The LVMI was higher in the AVS group (171 +/- 39 vs. 132 +/- 41 g/m2, p < 
      0.001). Patients with AVS also had higher transaortic flow velocities (1.64 +/- 0.36 
      vs. 1.21 +/- 0.21 m/s, p < 0.01) and maximal pressure gradients (10.8 +/- 7.1 vs. 
      5.9 +/- 3.4 mmHg, p < 0.01). The LVMI showed a direct correlation with transaortic 
      flow velocity in the AVS group (r = 0.60, p < 0.01). Stepwise linear regression 
      analysis revealed transaortic flow velocity (p = 0.02), pulse pressure (p = 0.01) 
      and haemoglobin levels (inverse relationship) (p = 0.02) to be independent 
      predictors of the LVMI. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that AVS is strongly and 
      independently interrelated with LVH in chronic haemodialysis patients. The 
      underlying mechanism might be the valve resistance to left ventricular outflow, as 
      shown by increased transaortic flow velocities and maximal pressure gradients in AVS 
      patients.

TI  - VS-501: A NOVEL, NON-ABSORBED, CALCIUM- AND ALUMINUM-FREE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE 
      PHOSPHATE BINDER DERIVED FROM NATURAL PLANT POLYMER.
LID - e00042 [pii]
AB  - Inadequate control of serum phosphate in chronic kidney disease can lead to 
      pathologies of clinical importance. Effectiveness of on-market phosphate binders is 
      limited by safety concerns and low compliance due to high pill size/burden and 
      gastrointestinal discomfort. VS-501 is a non-absorbed, calcium- and aluminum-free, 
      chemically-modified, plant-derived polymer. In vitro studies show that VS-501 has a 
      high density and a low swell volume when exposed to simulated gastric fluid (vs. 
      sevelamer). When male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats on normal diet were treated with 
      VS-501 or sevelamer, serum phosphate was not significantly altered, but urinary 
      phosphate levels decreased by >90%. VS-501 had no effect on serum calcium (Ca) or 
      urinary Ca, while 3% sevelamer significantly increased serum and urine Ca. In 5/6 
      nephrectomized (NX) uremic SD rats on high-phosphate diet, increasing dietary 
      phosphate led to an increase in serum and urine phosphate, which was prevented in 
      rats treated with VS-501 or sevelamer (0.2-5% in food). High phosphate diet also 
      increased serum FGF-23 and parathyroid hormone in 5/6 NX rats, which was prevented 
      by VS-501 or sevelamer. VS-501 or sevelamer increased fecal phosphate in a 
      dose-dependent manner. More aortic calcification was observed in 5/6 NX rats treated 
      with 5% sevelamer, while VS-501 and sevelamer did not show significant effects on 
      cardiac parameters, fibrosis, intestine histology and intestinal sodium-dependent 
      phosphate cotransporter gene expression. These results suggest that VS-501 is 
      effective in binding phosphate with no effects on calcium homeostasis, and may have 
      improved pill burden and gastrointestinal side effects.

TI  - Calciphylaxis and nonhealing wounds: the role of the vascular surgeon in a 
      multidisciplinary treatment.
PG  - 501-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Calciphylaxis, a disorder of calcium-phosphate metabolism that can result 
      in arterial calcification, skin and solid organ calcium deposits, and nonhealing 
      ulcerations, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although its 
      most common cause is secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure, 
      vascular surgeons are frequently called on to evaluate these nonhealing extremity 
      wounds. We reviewed our experience of a multidisciplinary approach in treating 
      patients with calciphylaxis and nonhealing ulcers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 
      14-month period at a tertiary center, five patients were seen with calciphylaxis and 
      nonhealing leg wounds. Demographics, disease characteristics, surgical treatment, 
      and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: All five patients were black women aged 40 +/- 
      8.9 years with hypertensive renal failure undergoing long-term hemodialysis (80 +/- 
      43 months). They had large, painful lower extremity wounds or necrotic ulcers (mean 
      size, 135 cm(2)) that had developed over 2 to 4 months. Three patients had palpable 
      pedal pulses, one patient had Doppler pedal signals, and one patient had absent 
      pedal flow. Arteriogram was performed in the latter two patients, and one patient 
      underwent lower extremity revascularization because of superficial femoral artery 
      stenosis with symptomatic improvement. Four patients underwent aggressive 
      debridement by the vascular surgical service, and two needed plastic 
      surgeon-performed skin grafting. All patients had elevated parathyroid hormone 
      levels (mean, 1735 pg/mL; > 25 x normal level); mean preoperative calcium levels 
      were normal (10 mg/dL). After either subtotal (n = 4) or total (n = 1) 
      parathyroidectomy by an experienced endocrine surgeon, a significant reduction in 
      parathyroid hormone and calcium levels was seen (122 pg/mL and 7.9 mg/dL, 
      respectively; P <.05). There were no postoperative complications or amputations; one 
      patient died 12 months after parathyroidectomy of severe preexisting cardiopulmonary 
      disease. Complete wound healing was observed by 4.8 +/- 2 months. During a mean 
      follow-up period of 9 months (range, 1 to 18 months), all wounds remained healed 
      without ulcer recurrence. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of calciphylaxis should be 
      considered in patients with end-stage renal disease with atypical tissue necrosis or 
      subcutaneous nodules. Early recognition of calciphylaxis and multidisciplinary 
      treatment, including diligent wound care, frequent debridement, parathyroidectomy, 
      and appropriate skin grafting or revascularization, can result in improved wound 
      healing and limb salvage.

      prescription of active vitamin D analogues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death for 
      haemodialysis patients. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
      haemodialysis patients have additional risk factors, including vascular 
      calcification. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measurement of arterial stiffness, and 
      we wished to determine whether PWV is affected by different factors in haemodialysis 
      patients compared to the general population. METHODS: Aortic PWV was measured in 303 
      adult patients attending for routine outpatient dialysis. RESULTS: 303 patients, 
      63.4% male, mean age 68.5 ± 15.8 years, 47.5% diabetic with a body mass index of 
      25.8 ± 5.3 kg/m(2), were studied. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 148.7 ± 28.6 
      mmHg and diastolic 80.4 ± 15.3 mmHg. Aortic PWV was 9.73 ± 2.08 m/s, and was 
      correlated with SBP (β 0.015, F 5.29, p = 0.023), log serum parathyroid hormone 
      (PTH) (β 1.58, F 13.85, p < 0.001) and prescription of alfacalcidol (β -1.11, F 
      6.81, p = 0.010). 197 patients had corresponding ECHO cardiograms, and in this 
      cohort PWV was associated with SBP (β 0.017, F 7.49, p = 0.006), log serum 
      parathyroid hormone (β 0.85, F 5.99, p < 0.015) and prescription of alfacalcidol (β 
      -0.8, F 4.18, p = 0.042), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (β 0.01, F 11.4, p = 
      0.001), and log serum triglycerides (β 1.43, F 4.79, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found that PWV, a measurement of arterial stiffness, was associated with both 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including SBP and LVMI, but also 
      non-traditional risk factors such as prescription of active vitamin D analogues, 
      suggesting a potential link between vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in 
      haemodialysis patients.

TI  - Inhibiting the progression of arterial calcification with vitamin K in HemoDialysis 
      patients (iPACK-HD) trial: rationale and study design for a randomized trial of 
      vitamin K in patients with end stage kidney disease.
PG  - 17

LID - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease, which is due in part to progressive vascular 
      calcification, is the leading cause of death among patients with end stage kidney 
      disease (ESKD) on dialysis. A role for vitamin K in the prevention of vascular 
      calcification is plausible based on the presence of vitamin K dependent proteins in 
      vascular tissue, including matrix gla protein (MGP). Evidence from animal models and 
      observational studies support a role for vitamin K in the prevention of vascular 
      calcification. A large-scale study is needed to investigate the effect of vitamin K 
      supplementation on the progression of vascular calcification in patients with ESKD, 
      a group at risk for sub-clinical vitamin K deficiency. METHODS/DESIGN: We plan a 
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter controlled trial of incident ESKD 
      patients on hemodialysis in centers within North America. Eligible subjects with a 
      baseline coronary artery calcium score of greater than or equal to 30 Agatston 
      Units, will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group (10 mg of 
      phylloquinone three times per week) or to the control group (placebo administration 
      three times per week). The primary endpoint is the progression of coronary artery 
      calcification defined as a greater than 15% increase in CAC score over baseline 
      after 12 months. DISCUSSION: Vitamin K supplementation is a simple, safe and 
      cost-effective nutritional strategy that can easily be integrated into patient care. 
      If vitamin K reduces the progression of coronary artery calcification it may lead to 
      decreased morbidity and mortality in men and women with ESKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      NCT 01528800.

TI  - Secreted Phosphoprotein 24 is a Biomarker of Mineral Metabolism.
PG  - 354-363
LID - 10.1007/s00223-020-00783-3 [doi]
AB  - The 24 kD form of secreted phosphoprotein (SPP-24), a cytokine-binding bone matrix 
      protein with various truncated C-terminal products, is primarily synthesized by the 
      liver. SPP-24 shares homology with fetuin-A, a potent vascular and soft tissue 
      calcification inhibitor and SPP-24 is one component of calciprotein particles 
      (CPPs), a circulating fetuin-mineral complex. The limited molecular evidence to date 
      suggests that SPP-24 may also function as an inhibitor of bone formation and ectopic 
      vascular calcification, potentially through bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) and 
      Wnt-signaling mediated actions. The C-terminal products of SPP-24 bind to BMP-2 and 
      attenuate BMP-2-induced bone formation. The aim of this study was to assess 
      circulating SPP-24 in relation to kidney function and in concert with markers of 
      mineral metabolism in humans. SPP-24 was measured in the serum of total of 192 
      subjects using ELISA-based measurements. Subjects were participants of one of two 
      cohorts: (1) mGFR Cohort (n = 80) was participants of a study of measured GFR (mGFR) 
      using inulin urinary clearance, recruited mostly from a chronic kidney disease 
      clinic with low-range kidney function (eGFR 38.7 ± 25.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and (2) 
      CaMOS Cohort (n = 112) was a subset of randomly selected, community-dwelling 
      participants of year 10 of the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study with eGFR in 
      the normal range of 75.0 ± 15.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In the combined cohort, the mean 
      SPP-24 was 167.7 ± 101.1 ng/mL (range 33.4-633.6 ng/mL). The mean age was 
      66.5 ± 11.3, 57.1% female and mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) was 59.9 ± 27.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) 
      (range 8-122 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). There was a strong inverse correlation between 
      SPP-24 and eGFR (R = - 0.58, p < 0.001) that remained after adjustment for age. 
      Following adjustment for age, eGFR, and sex, SPP-24 was significantly associated 
      with phosphate (R = - 0.199), PTH (R = 0.298), and the Wnt-signaling inhibitor 
      Dickkopf-related protein 1 (R = - 0.156). The results of this study indicate that 
      SPP-24 is significantly altered by kidney function and is the first human data 
      linking levels of SPP-24 to other biomarkers involved in mineral metabolism. Whether 
      there is a role for circulating SPP-24 in bone formation and ectopic mineralization 
      requires further study.

TI  - Serum fetuin-A levels inversely correlate with the severity of arterial 
      calcification in patients with chronic lower extremity atherosclerosis without renal 
      disease.
PG  - 474-50
AB  - AIM: Fetuin-A is a hepatic glycoprotein that inhibits extraosseous calcification. 
      Lower serum fetuin-A concentration was associated with severe arterial calcification 
      in patients with end stage renal disease. We evaluated the association of serum 
      fetuin-A levels and the severity of atherosclerosis in patients with peripheral 
      vascular disease having normal renal function. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study among 93 chronic atherosclerotic patients with lower extremity vascular 
      disease, systemic atherosclerosis and calcification was assessed by ultrasound 
      (carotid intima-media thickness/IMT/, calcification at the abdominal aorta, carotid 
      and femoral bifurcations, aortic and mitral valves) and angiography (Bollinger 
      score). Standard serum markers of inflammation, diabetes, renal function, 
      ankle-brachial indexes and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted 
      and Fontaine classification was applied for the severity of symptoms. RESULTS: The 
      patients mean (SD) age was 59.95 (7.61) years, 78% were men, 35% had diabetes. Serum 
      fetuin-A level showed significant negative correlation with ultrasound calcification 
      score (P=0.018, r=-0.257) and Bollinger angiographic score (P=0.035, r=-0.347). 
      Fetuin-A did not correlate with IMT or Fontaine classification. Fetuin-A also showed 
      significant correlation with albumin, transferrin and hemoglobin A1c (r=0.287, 0.305 
      and 0.219, respectively at P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the 
      association between fetuin-A and calcification score (OR: 3.03, CI: 1.05-8.7), 
      P=0.039) independent of traditional risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our data show that 
      serum fetuin-A levels inversely correlate with the severity of atherosclerosis in 
      nonuremic patients with symptomatic chronic lower limb ischemia. These data support 
      a putative protective role for fetuin-A in the development of arterial 
      calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peritoneal calcification (PC) is a specific finding in patients 
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but its prevalence, risk factors, and impacts 
      in PD patients remain unclear. The present study investigated these issues and 
      provided information useful for the management of PC. METHODS: The study included 
      183 PD patients. The severity of PC was determined using abdominal computed 
      tomography (CT), and we summed up all scores from slices obtained from the diaphragm 
      to the pelvic floor normalized to body surface area. We analyzed the associations 
      between PC and demographic and clinical characteristics, and between PC and levels 
      of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegrin and fetuin-A. The 
      determinants of PC were examined using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Patients were categorized into group 1 (without PC, n = 133) and group 2 (with PC, 
      n = 50). Group 2 patients showed different degrees of PC with a mean of 160±769 
      mm(2)/m(2). Group 1 patients had higher fetuin-A levels than group 2 patients 
      (861±309 vs. 760±210 µg/mL; p = 0.021). The independent risk factors for the 
      presence of PC included male gender, previous peritonitis, and PD adequacy (KT/V). 
      Further analysis performed in group 2 patients showed that the dosage of vitamin D, 
      serum levels of CRP, and dialysate calcium load were the independent determinants of 
      PC. However, the presence of PC did not affect patients' technique survival, 
      peritonitis incidence, or mortality in the mean follow up period of 28±12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and severity of PC were associated with inflammation, 
      peritoneal KT/V, and mineral metabolism. The impact of PC on the outcomes of PD 
      patients requires further study with a longer follow-up.

TI  - Study design and subject baseline characteristics in the ADVANCE Study: effects of 
      cinacalcet on vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1916-23
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet 
      plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the effect of 
      cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of active vitamin D 
      on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis patients. We 
      report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject characteristics. METHODS: 
      ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized, open-label study. Adult 
      haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (intact 
      parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC 
      score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score (>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and 
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin 
      D (cinacalcet group) or flexible dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The 
      study had three phases: screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC 
      scores obtained by cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and 
      weeks 28 and 52. The primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from 
      baseline to Week 52. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or 
      control. Mean age was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 
      36.7 months (range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the 
      Agatston method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score 
      was independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH. 
      Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The 
      ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Withdrawal of cinacalcet at the time of renal transplantation is not a risk factor 
      for allograft calcifications in the early posttransplantation period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a relevant problem in patients on 
      dialysis. Cinacalcet in regular clinical practice increases the percentage of 
      patients achieving treatment targets for PTH, Ca and P. We evaluated allograft 
      calcification in serial protocol biopsies after transplantation among patients 
      receiving Cinacalcet on dialysis but discontinued after surgery. METHODS: This 
      retrospective single-centre study included kidney allograft recipients who were 
      receiving Cinacalcet for more than 6 months before surgery and had it withdrawn 
      thereafter. The 46 patients including 17 women showed a mean overall age of 54 ± 30 
      years. Protocol graft biopsy was performed at 3 and at 12 months. Biochemical 
      analyses at the time of biopsy included blood levels of creatinine, phosphorus, 
      calcium, alkaline phosphatases, iPTH, and proteinuria. RESULTS: Any biopsy showed 
      nephrocalcinosis either intratubular calcifications, or in the parenchyma. There 
      were no changes in calcemia (10.22 ± 0.7 to 10.27 ± 0.7 mg/dL), in alkaline 
      phosphatase (259 ± 119.6 to 255 ± 122.3 mg/dL) nor in iPTH (317 ± 220.2 to 320 ± 
      168.8 pg/mL) between 3 and 12 months respectively. There was a slight but 
      non-significant increase in serum phosphorus (2.79 ± 0.8 to 3.22 ± 0.9 mg/dL), serum 
      creatinine (1.53 ± 0.6 to 1.84 ± 1.2 mg/dL) and proteinuria (528 ± 603 to 879 ± 1398 
      mg/24h) between 3 and 12 months respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Withdrawal of Cinacalcet 
      at the time of renal transplantation was not a risk factor for allograft 
      calcifications in the early post-transplant period.

TI  - Important abnormalities of bone mineral metabolism are present in patients with 
      coronary artery disease with a mild decrease of the estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate.
PG  - 587-98
LID - 10.1007/s00774-015-0706-y [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is characterized by 
      increased circulating levels of parathormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF23), bone disease, and vascular calcification, and is associated with adverse 
      outcomes. We studied the prevalence of mineral metabolism disorders, and the 
      potential relationship between decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      and CKD-MBD in coronary artery disease patients in a cross-sectional study of 704 
      outpatients 7.5 ± 3.0 months after an acute coronary syndrome. The mean eGFR (CKD 
      Epidemiology Collaboration formula) was 75.8 ± 19.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Our patients 
      showed lower calcidiol plasma levels than a healthy cohort from the same 
      geographical area. In the case of men, this finding was present despite similar 
      creatinine levels in both groups and older age of the healthy subjects. Most 
      patients (75.6 %) had an eGFR below 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (eGFR categories G2-G5), 
      with 55.3 % of patients exhibiting values of 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (G2). PTH 
      (r = -0.3329, p < 0.0001) and FGF23 (r = -0.3641, p < 0.0001) levels inversely 
      correlated with eGFR, whereas calcidiol levels and serum phosphate levels did not. 
      Overall, PTH levels were above normal in 34.9 % of patients. This proportion 
      increased from 19.4 % in G1 category patients, to 33.7 % in G2 category patients and 
      56.6 % in G3-G5 category patients (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, eGFR and 
      calcidiol levels were the main independent determinants of serum PTH. The mean FGF23 
      levels were 69.9 (54.6-96.2) relative units (RU)/ml, and 33.2 % of patients had 
      FGF23 levels above 85.5 RU/ml (18.4 % in G1 category patients, 30.0 % in G2 category 
      patients, and 59.2 % in G3-G5 category patients; p < 0.001). In multivariate 
      analysis, eGFR was the main predictor of FGF23 levels. Increased phosphate levels 
      were present in 0.7 % of the whole sample: 0 % in G1 category patients, 0.3 % in G2 
      category patients, and 2.8 % in G3-G5 category patients (p = 0.011). Almost 90 % of 
      patients had calcidiol insufficiency without significant differences among the 
      different degrees of eGFR. In conclusion, in patients with coronary artery disease 
      there is a large prevalence of increased FGF23 and PTH levels. These findings have 
      an independent relationship with decreased eGFR, and are evident at an eGFR of 
      60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Then, mild decreases in eGFR must be taken in consideration 
      by the clinician because they are associated with progressive abnormalities of 
      mineral metabolism.

TI  - Risk Factors for New-Onset Cardiac Valve Calcification in Patients on Maintenance 
      Peritoneal Dialysis.
PG  - 150-8
LID - 10.1159/000443620 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with end-stage renal disease are susceptible to cardiac valve 
      calcification (CVC) due to mineral metabolism disorders and other factors. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors for new-onset CVC in 
      patients on maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: This study included 
      patients who underwent PD catheter insertion from January 2006 to June 2013 in our 
      Peritoneal Dialysis Center. Clinical data were collected on CVC status during 
      echocardiography evaluations (twice) at an interval of >6 months. The data collected 
      included intact parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum phosphorus (P), 
      serum calcium (Ca), albumin (Alb), prealbumin and the use of five types of 
      antihypertensive drugs, statins, active vitamin D3 and Ca tablets. RESULTS: In 
      total, 194 patients - 105 (54.1%) men, average age 60.5 ± 13.0 years - were 
      included. CVC was present in 50 (25.8%) patients during PD catheter placement. After 
      an average PD duration of 20.9 ± 10.4 months, CVC was detected in 97 patients 
      (50.0%). New-onset CVC was found in 62 patients (32.0%). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis revealed that only serum P levels (p = 0.01, OR = 2.569), Alb 
      levels (p = 0.04, OR = 0.935), dialysis duration (p = 0.03, OR = 1.039) and CRP 
      levels (p = 0.02, OR = 1.031) were associated with CVC. CONCLUSION: Serum P, Alb and 
      CRP levels as well as dialysis duration are independent risk factors for CVC.

TI  - The relationship between the Spine Deformity Index, biochemical parameters of bone 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications: results from the Epidemiological VERtebral 
      FRACtures iTalian Study (EVERFRACT) in dialysis patients.
PG  - 1595-603
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2014-0194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures 
      (VFs), providing information on both their number and severity. METHODS: We 
      evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical and arterial 
      calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, assessed by 
      quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were identified in 
      the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of fracture severity, we 
      created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the number of VFs. We assessed 
      routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), undercaboxylated BGP (ucBGP), and 
      matrix-Gla-protein (MGP). RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD patients with a SDI 
      >1 were more frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP (p<0.01). Patients with a 
      c-SDI >1 had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP 
      (p<0.05). Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC) were more frequent in 
      patients with SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic 
      regression showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91), age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) 
      and albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 
      1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI 1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, CI 
      0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity 
      of VFs was associated with age, atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

TI  - Raloxifene ameliorates progressive bone loss in postmenopausal dialysis patients 
      with controlled parathyroid hormone levels.
PG  - 423-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women undergoing chronic hemodialysis are at risk of 
      uremic bone disease and postmenopausal osteoporosis. There are few reports 
      discussing the effects of raloxifene hydrochloride on chronic hemodialysis patients. 
      We investigated whether differences in the effects of raloxifene on bone mineral 
      density (BMD) are dependent on the level of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). 
      METHODS: 47 postmenopausal hemodialysis patients with osteoporosis were divided into 
      two groups, i.e. Group A, with treatment, and Group B, without treatment by 
      raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day, three times per week) for 1 year. We evaluated 
      the changes in BMD at the distal one-third of the radial bone and aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) by plain abdominal computerized tomography. Furthermore, 
      we compared the BMD and ACI results for patients with similar iPTH levels within 
      each group. RESULTS: After 1 year of raloxifene treatment, patients with iPTH levels 
      of < 250 pg/ml in Group A showed significantly less BMD deterioration than similar 
      patients in Group B (A: -0.31 +/- 1.7% vs. B: -3.71 +/- 0.7%, p = 0.04). However, 
      raloxifene showed no difference in patients with iPTH levels of > or = 250 pg/ml in 
      the two groups (A: -3.49 +/- 0.7% vs. B: -6.10 +/- 1.9%, p = 0.09). Among the 
      patients with iPTH levels of < 250 pg/ml, changes in the ACI values were 1.30 +/- 
      0.3% for Group A and 1.67 +/- 1.0% for Group B. Among the patients with iPTH levels 
      of (3) 250 pg/ml, the ACI values were 2.58 +/- 0.7% for Group A and 3.01 +/- 1.2% 
      for Group B. CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene treatment was useful for the prevention of BMD 
      deterioration in postmenopausal dialysis patients with controlled iPTH levels.

TI  - Association between serum osteoprotegerin level and mortality in kidney transplant 
      recipients - a prospective observational cohort study.
LID - 10.1111/tri.13847 [doi]
AB  - Paradoxically, higher serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG: a vascular calcification 
      inhibitor) have been associated with increased arterial stiffness, risk of 
      cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. A few studies reported that 
      post-transplant OPG levels are associated with mortality in kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients. In this study, this association was assessed in a cohort of prevalent KT 
      recipients, adjusting for previously untested potential confounders, including 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Socio-demographic and 
      clinical parameters, medical and transplant history, and laboratory data were 
      collected from 982 prevalent KT recipients. The association between serum OPG and 
      all-cause mortality over a 6-year follow-up period was examined using Kaplan-Meier 
      survival curves and multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. Participants with 
      high serum OPG were more likely female, older, deceased donor KT recipients and have 
      more comorbidity, lower eGFR, higher FGF23, higher IL-6, and longer dialysis 
      vintage. Each 1 pmol/l higher serum OPG level was associated with a 49% higher risk 
      of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.49 [1.40-1.61]). 
      This association persisted after adjusting for confounders (HR [95% CI]: 1.20 
      [1.10-1.30]). In conclusion, serum OPG was associated with all-cause mortality 
      independent of several novel confounders in prevalent KT recipients.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification in haemodialysis patients: role of calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.
PG  - 2037-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
      frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
      potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD 
      patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control 
      subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was 
      determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of 
      haemodialysis. RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients 
      than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% 
      vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older 
      than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, 
      had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
      highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and 
      the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also found a 
      positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was 
      found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple 
      stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters 
      for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more 
      frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and 
      with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age 
      (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and 
      calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support 
      careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage 
      renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin is a marker of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease stages 3-5.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), known to regulate bone mass by 
      inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation, might also play a role in 
      vascular calcification. Increased circulating OPG levels in patients with CKD are 
      associated with aortic calcification and increased mortality. We assessed the 
      predictive role of OPG for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with 
      CKD stages 3-5 over a 5-year follow-up period. We evaluated the relationship between 
      OPG and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 145 CKD patients (stages 3-5) in a 
      prospective observational follow-up study. Inflammation markers, including 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, standard echocardiography, and estimation of 
      intima-media thickness in the common carotid artery, were assessed at baseline, and 
      correlations with OPG levels were determined. The cutoff values for OPG were defined 
      using ROC curves for cardiovascular mortality. Survival was assessed during follow 
      up lasting for up to 5.5 years using Fine and Gray model. A total of 145 (89 men; 
      age 58.9 ± 15.0 years) were followed up. The cutoff value for OPG determined using 
      ROC was 10 pmol/L for general causes mortality and 10.08 pmol/L for CV causes 
      mortality. Patients with higher serum OPG levels presented with higher mortality 
      rates compared to patients with lower levels. Aalen-Johansen cumulative incidence 
      curve analysis demonstrated significantly worse survival rates in individuals with 
      higher baseline OPG levels for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (p < 0.001). 
      In multivariate analysis, OPG was a marker of general and cardiovascular mortality 
      independent of sex, age, CVD, diabetes, and CRP levels. When CKD stages were 
      included in the multivariate analysis, OPG was an independent marker of all-cause 
      mortality but not cardiovascular mortality. Elevated serum OPG levels were 
      associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of 
      age, CVD, diabetes, and inflammatory markers, in patients with CKD.

TI  - Role of phytate and osteopontin in the mechanism of soft tissue calcification.
PG  - 768-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanism of calcium deposition in soft tissues is of 
      great importance in a variety of pathological conditions such as chronic kidney 
      disease. The present study examined the role of phytate and osteopontin during the 
      development of soft tissue calcification in an animal model. METHODS: Male Wistar 
      rats (16 rats per treatment) were fed with a diet (AIN-76A) in which phytate is 
      undetectable (non-phytate-treated group), or with a phytin-enriched AIN-76A diet 
      (phytate-treated group). After 21 days on the respective diets, all rats were 
      subjected to calcinosis induction by subcutaneous injection with KMnO4 at 2 sites on 
      either side of the interscapular region. At 2, 5, 8 and 10 days after the calcinosis 
      induction, 4 rats of each group were sacrificed, and the injured tissues were 
      removed for histological analysis and for calcium determination. RESULTS: 
      Calcification was notably and significantly reduced in phytate-treated rats compared 
      with non-phytate-treated rats. Calcified deposits appeared as soon as 2 days after 
      calcinosis induction, but inflammation with the presence of macrophages, lymphocytes 
      and eosinophils was not typically observed until 5 days postinduction. Osteopontin 
      was only detected 8 days postinduction, and was clearly associated with calcified 
      areas. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest an important role for crystallization 
      inhibitors such as phytate in reducing hydroxyapatite crystal formation in the first 
      steps of soft tissue calcification. Histological analysis indicated that osteopontin 
      was not involved during initiation of soft tissue calcification. Osteopontin appears 
      be involved in the control of calcification rather than its genesis.

TI  - A case of idiopathic basal ganglia calcification associated with 
      membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
PG  - 2351-6
AB  - Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC) is a syndrome in which bilateral 
      cerebral calcification occurs despite the absence of abnormal calcium metabolism. A 
      17-year-old Japanese female was admitted for investigation of intermittent 
      proteinuria from the age of 12 years. On admission, her blood pressure was 126/60 
      mmHg and her serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL. Although computed tomography revealed 
      bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis, her level of intelligence and neurological 
      findings were normal, as were the results of endocrine tests including parathyroid 
      hormone. Asymptomatic IBGC was diagnosed. Renal biopsy showed membranoproliferative 
      glomerulonephritis. Peritoneal dialysis was started for end-stage renal failure when 
      she was 24 years old. Pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs started to develop at the 
      age of 27 years and progressed, resulting in death from aspiration pneumonia at the 
      age of 32 years. Post-mortem revealed bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia, 
      dentate nucleus, thalamus, and centrum semiovale. On light microscopy, there was 
      circumferential calcification of the media and intima of affected vessels in the 
      brain, including small arteries, small veins, and capillaries, and luminal narrowing 
      was seen. On electron microscopy, layers of differing electron density were arranged 
      in concentric laminae. This is the first report of IBGC with bilateral and 
      symmetrical cerebral calcification accompanied by membranoproliferative 
      glomerulonephritis resulting in end-stage renal failure.

TI  - Nonuraemic nonfatal idiopathic calciphylaxis in a kitten.
PG  - 547-e131
LID - 10.1111/vde.12064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare cutaneous disorder, characterized by vascular 
      calcification and progressive skin necrosis, not yet described in cats. It is 
      scarcely reported in animals, mostly due to iatrogenic or uraemic disturbances of 
      the calcium-phosphate balance. In human patients, it is most commonly seen with 
      end-stage renal disease, but several nonuraemic disorders, including inherited 
      dysfunctions of tissue calcification inhibitors, have also been described. 
      HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of nonuraemic calciphylaxis in a cat. 
      ANIMALS: A 10-week-old male domestic short hair kitten was presented with hyperacute 
      skin lesions. Initial dermatological signs were characterized by sharp demarcated 
      erosions and ulcerations on the face, including the nasal planum and lips. Cutaneous 
      lesions rapidly progressed into thick crusts with ulcerations, involving parts of 
      the face and pinna as well as abdominal skin. METHODS: Complete blood count, serum 
      chemistry profile, urinalysis, parathyroid hormone measurement and histopathological 
      examination of skin biopsies. RESULTS: Histopathology from newly developed abdominal 
      skin lesions revealed severe epidermal necrosis and calcification, multifocal 
      pannicular calcification and calcified subcutaneous vessels, supporting a diagnosis 
      of calciphylaxis. Treatment consisted of systemic and topical antimicrobials, 
      analgesics, pentoxifylline, Lantharenol(®) , sodium thiosulfate and vitamin K. After 
      initiation of therapy, no further progression was noticed; all medications could be 
      discontinued eventually, and no relapse was seen in the following 2 years. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Calciphylaxis should be considered as a 
      differential diagnosis for ulcerative cutaneous disorders in young cats. More 
      information on this disease is needed to elucidate the pathomechanism.

TI  - Effects of cyclic intermittent etidronate therapy on coronary artery calcification 
      in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 680-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is thought to be associated with 
      greater cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease than in 
      nonuremic persons. The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of 
      etidronate, a synthetic analogue of pyrophosphate, on progression of CAC score. 
      METHODS: The extent of CAC was evaluated by using multidetector spiral computed 
      tomography. Repeated CAC score estimation was possible in 35 patients (29 men, 6 
      women). Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry. Serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) was measured by using enzyme-linked 
      immunoassay. Serum etidronate was measured by means of the gas spectrometry 
      technique using deuterium-labeled etidronate as internal standard. RESULTS: Mean 
      patient age was 63.2 +/- 8.2 (SD) years, and mean duration of dialysis therapy was 
      7.4 +/- 5.5 years. CAC score was estimated 3 times in each patient. After the second 
      CAC score estimation, 35 patients were administered etidronate, 200 mg/d, for 14 
      days. This cycle was repeated 3 times every 90 days. CAC progression was 
      significantly less pronounced during treatment with etidronate compared with the 
      period before treatment was initiated. The median annualized absolute increase in 
      calcified volume was 195.0 mm3 without treatment compared with -490.0 mm3 during 
      treatment ( P < 0.01). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on changes in CAC 
      score during etidronate treatment. Responders (n = 26) were patients whose CAC score 
      decreased during therapy, and nonresponders (n = 9) were patients whose CAC score 
      increased, even after etidronate therapy. Serum C-reactive protein values (0.18 +/- 
      0.13 mg/dL) in the responder group were greater than those (0.14 +/- 0.08 mg/dL) in 
      the nonresponder group ( P = 0.013). Serum OPG levels decreased significantly during 
      etidronate therapy (256.8 +/- 93.8 versus 245.0 +/- 83.0 pg/mL; P = 0.0161). 
      Etidronate was well tolerated during the study. BMD values during etidronate therapy 
      were not significantly changed from 0.941 +/- 0.125 to 0.968 +/- 0.246 g/cm2. 
      CONCLUSION: Results of the present study suggest that the extent of CAC may be 
      suppressed by etidronate in association with a reduction in chronic inflammatory 
      responses. They also suggest that a decrease in serum OPG concentrations by means of 
      etidronate may be associated with changes in vascular calcification in dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - [Cutaneous calciphylaxis treated by autologous keratinocytes graft and subtotal 
      parathyroidectomy].
PG  - 260-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calciphylaxis, seen most often in dialysis patients, is 
      characterised by skin necrosis, and is a disabling and lifethreatening disease. 
      Despite intensive topical treatment, recourse to parathyroidectomy is often 
      necessary. We report the case of a female patient with skin necrosis due to 
      calciphylaxis: pain and necrotic lesions were controlled by grafting of cultured 
      autologous keratinocytes (Epibase). CASE REPORT: A 75-year-old woman with a 5-year 
      history of dialysis-dependent chronic renal failure secondary to 
      nephroangiosclerosis presented a very painful necrotic ulceration on her left leg. 
      In spite of an autologous patch grafts, the lesions rapidly deteriorated. Laboratory 
      data showed high levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone and imaging 
      suggested parathyroidal adenoma. Although cutaneous biopsy was not performed, the 
      diagnosis of cutaneous necrosis due to calciphylaxis with tertiary 
      hyperparathyroidism was established. Treatment consisted of a low-calcium and 
      low-phosphorus diet with autologous keratinocytes grafts (Epibase). After the third 
      application of keratinocytes, the pain disappeared, necrosis ceased and wound 
      healing began. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed two months after the start 
      of grafts. At three months, the patient was cured. DISCUSSION: . Calciphylaxis is an 
      obstructive vascular disease secondary to calcification of the arterioles leading to 
      ischemic tissue necrosis. Prompt diagnosis is essential since this disease is 
      disabling and life-threatening due to sepsis and ischemic complications. In our 
      case, autologous keratinocyte grafts allowed pain relief to be achieved within large 
      expanses of cutaneous necrosis after correction of calcium and phosphorus levels, 
      thereby allowing parathyroidectomy to be performed under optimal conditions.

TI  - Long-term effect of cinacalcet hydrochloride on abdominal aortic calcification in 
      patients on hemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.2147/IJNRD.S54731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is one of the common complications 
      in dialysis patients, and is associated with increased risk of vascular 
      calcification. The effects of cinacalcet hydrochloride treatment on bone and mineral 
      metabolism have been previously reported, but the benefit of cinacalcet on vascular 
      calcification remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 
      cinacalcet on abdominal aortic calcification in dialysis patients. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients were on maintenance hemodialysis with insufficiently controlled 
      SHPT (intact parathyroid hormone [PTH] >180 pg/mL) by conventional therapies. All 
      subjects were initially administered 25 mg cinacalcet daily, with concomitant use of 
      calcitriol analogs. Abdominal aortic calcification was annually evaluated by 
      calculating aortic calcification area index (ACAI) using multidetector computed 
      tomography (MDCT), from 12 months before to 36 months after the initiation of 
      cinacalcet therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were analyzed in this study. The 
      mean age was 59.0±8.7 years, 34.8% were women, and the mean dialysis duration was 
      163.0±76.0 months. After administration of cinacalcet, serum levels of intact PTH, 
      phosphorus, and calcium significantly decreased, and mean Ca × P values 
      significantly decreased from 67.4±7.9 mg(2)/dL(2) to 52±7.7 mg(2)/dL(2). Although 
      the ACAI value did not decrease during the observation period, the increase in ACAI 
      between 24 months and 36 months after cinacalcet administration was significantly 
      suppressed. CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of cinacalcet was associated with 
      reduced progression of abdominal aortic calcification, and achieving appropriate 
      calcium and phosphorus levels may reduce the rates of cardiovascular events and 
      mortality in patients on hemodialysis.

TI  - General weakness as an indication for parathyroid surgery in patients with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 1108-11
AB  - HYPOTHESES: There are factors that affect patients with general weakness owing to 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism and as reported by results noted after 
      parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. DESIGN: Case series and consecutive 
      samples. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: From July 1996 to June 1998, 56 
      patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism underwent total parathyroidectomy and 
      autotransplantation. Their ages were 45 +/- 13 years (mean +/- SD) and preoperative 
      duration of dialysis was 75 +/- 37 months. Prior to surgery the patients were 
      divided into 2 groups: group A comprised 2 men and 19 women who had some general 
      weakness; and group B, 15 men and 20 women who reported no general weakness. The 
      etiologies of renal failure, such as diabetic nephropathy (n = 3) or hypertensive 
      nephropathy (n = 3), were found only in group A patients. INTERVENTIONS: Serum 
      levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone 
      (intact) were checked preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, and 3 months after surgery. 
      Extension force of the quadriceps femoris muscle was measured at 60 degrees of right 
      knee flexion preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. The extension force was 
      expressed as newtons (N) in 2 different quantities: peak force and average force. 
      The degree of general weakness was classified into 4 groups: 0, no weakness; 1, some 
      subjective weakness and/or walking with assistance; 2, the patient was wheelchair 
      bound; and 3, the patient was bedridden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The t test was used 
      for paired and unpaired data; Wilcoxon signed rank and Fisher exact tests were 
      incorporated for nonparametric data. Any values of P<.05 were considered 
      significant. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, 2 patients in group A reported degree 3 
      weakness; 5, degree 2 weakness; and 14, degree 1 weakness. Three months after 
      surgery, the peak force was noticed to have increased from 185 +/- 56 N to 249 +/- 
      82 N (mean +/- SD) (n = 11, P = .003), and the average force showed an increase from 
      136 +/- 45 N to 202 +/- 69 N (n = 11, P = .003). Postoperatively, only 5 patients 
      had degree 1 weakness, 1 had degree 2 weakness, and none had degree 3 weakness. The 
      patient with degree 2 weakness after surgery had diabetes mellitus and a femoral 
      neck fracture prior to parathyroidectomy. Improvement in condition of general 
      weakness was found (P<.001) between preoperative and postoperative periods. Serum 
      levels of calcium were higher in group A (2.82 +/- 0.23 mmol/L [11.3 +/- 0.9 mg/dL]) 
      than in group B (2.64 +/- 0.27 mmol/L [10.6 +/- 1.1 mg/dL]) (P = .013), and serum 
      levels of parathyroid hormone (intact) were lower in group A (108.9 +/- 39.2 pmol/L) 
      than in group B (139.8 +/- 39.6 pmol/L) (P = .006). Except for sex, other data such 
      as phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels, age, and duration of dialysis were 
      not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: General weakness that 
      is commonly observed in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism is found more 
      frequently in women and only in patients with diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive 
      nephropathy. Patients with general weakness had relatively higher levels of calcium 
      and lower levels of parathyroid hormone (intact). We found that improvement of 
      muscle power and general weakness can be achieved by parathyroidectomy and 
      autotransplantation. In addition to itchy skin, bone pain, and soft tissue 
      calcification, general weakness that may cause disability is also an indication for 
      surgery in secondary hyperparathyrodism.

TI  - Successful treatment of tumoral calcinosis using CAPD combined with hemodialysis 
      with low-calcium dialysate.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Successful treatment of tumoral calcinosis using continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) combined with hemodialysis is described. A 32-year-old male patient 
      with a 2-year history of CAPD rapidly developed multiple metastatic calcification 
      (tumoral calcinosis) adjacent to his fingers, elbows, and knee joints. Tests showed 
      severe hyperphosphatemia, moderate hypercalcemia, and increased Ca-P product without 
      elevation of intact parathyroid hormone. An enlarged parathyroid gland was not found 
      by echography. In order to rapidly lower the excessive Ca and P levels, a combined 
      therapy with CAPD and vigorous transient hemodialysis using a low-Ca dialysate was 
      performed. In parallel, the patient was given calcitonin, bisphosphonate, and 
      short-term Al to ameliorate the metastatic calcifications more effectively. The 
      result was dramatic with disappearance of the tumoral calcinosis as well as 
      improvement in subjective symptoms within a few months. The present case suggests 
      that combined therapy with hemodialysis and CAPD using a low-Ca dialysate, together 
      with Ca-modulating agents, can be effective in ameliorating tumoral calcinosis in 
      patients on CAPD.
