AB  - Background: Most studies have focused on evaluating the association between the presence of small bowel vascular lesions (SBVLs) and patients' comorbidities.Aims: We sought to uncover a more fundamental indicator that may predict the presence of SBVLs by considering atherosclerosis qualitatively and quantitatively.Methods: We enrolled 79 consecutive patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding who had undergone computed tomography (CT) and capsule endoscopy or double-balloon endoscopy from January 2015 to June 2017. The SBVL frequency, type, and location, and the relationship between the presence of SBVLs and the patients' clinical characteristics were evaluated. Arterial wall calcification was assessed on unenhanced CT images, and a modified Agatston scoring system was used to determine the abdominal aorta calcium scores.Results: Of the 27 (34%) patients with SBVLs, 15 (19%) had type 1a, 12 (15%) had type 1b, and 2 (3%) had type 2a SBVLs. Most of the lesions were located in the jejunum. Cardiovascular disease (P = .017), chronic kidney disease (P = .025), and arteriosclerosis (P = .0036) were associated with the presence of SBVLs. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that arteriosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 7.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-143.9) and superior mesenteric artery calcification (OR 16.3; 95% CI 3.64-118.6) were independent predictors of the presence of SBVLs. The modified Agatston score was significantly higher in SBVL cases than in non-SBVL cases (6384 vs. 2666, P = .0023).Conclusions: Arteriosclerosis, especially increased superior mesenteric artery calcification, is associated with an increased likelihood of SBVLs.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk.Methods: Between the years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause mortality.Results: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking history-adjusted analyses.Conclusion: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted risk-lowering strategies.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the degree and incidence of atherosclerosis in internal thoracic (ITA) and radial arteries (RA) harvested for coronary bypass grafting. Materials and Methods: The association of major clinical events and etiological factors for atherosclerosis was investigated in 770 arterial segments obtained prospectively from 480 patients. Potential risk factors for atherosclerosis were age, gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal failure, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, hypertension, and a positive family history. Results: Six types of histological lesions have been defined; grade III or more was present in the RA in 47 (16%) patients and in the ITA in 30 (7%). The mean grade was 1.6 +/- 0.6 in the ITA and 2.1 +/- 0.9 in the RA (p < 0.001). Conclusion: RA had a significantly greater prevalence of atherosclerosis than the same patients' ITA. There was a strong correlation between ITA atherosclerosis and age. The presence of calcification may lead surgeons to avoid an extra incision according to risk factors, although most of these are not predictive.

AB  - Fractures occur frequently in people living with stroke and have high personal, social, and economic costs for these individuals, their families, and the community. Exercise to reduce the risk of fragility fractures is a relatively new application in stroke rehabilitation but is a promising treatment with the potential to reduce the incidence of falls as well as maintain or improve bone health. In this article, we outline fracture risk factors and provide an overview of exercise interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk poststroke. Although randomized controlled trials support the use of exercise to reduce fracture risk factors poststroke, the body of literature is small and further studies are required. Further, the optimal dose of exercise and the additive effects of pharmacology on fracture risk need to be determined. Given the many health benefits associated with exercise, it should be considered an important modality for the management of falls and maintenance of bone health following stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular disease burden in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that bisphosphonate therapy would reduce the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult women with stage 3 or 4 CKD receiving primary care in a large rural integrated health care system in 2004-2010. EXPOSURE: Time-dependent exposure status based on outpatient prescription for any medication within the bisphosphonate class, obtained from electronic health records. OUTCOMES: Time to death and first cardiovascular event (composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke). RESULTS: Data from 9,604 eligible female patients with CKD were analyzed; 3,234 were treated with bisphosphonate therapy. During a median follow-up of 3.9 (25th-75th percentile, 2.3-5.4) years, there were 286 versus 881 deaths and 206 versus 571 cardiovascular events (treated vs not-treated groups, respectively). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR for death (treated vs not treated) was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91; P = 0.003). In Cox modeling adjusted for similar baseline covariates, treatment with bisphosphonates was not associated with a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94-1.39; P = 0.2). LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding by unidentified factors, exclusion of male patients, and lack of information about longitudinal drug adherence. CONCLUSIONS: For female patients with CKD, treatment with bisphosphonates is associated with a lower risk of death, but not cardiovascular events. Confirmatory studies and investigations of potential causal mechanisms are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) are risk factors for kidney function decline in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 125 stage 3 to 5 predialysis CKD patients. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: CKD patients receiving care in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. METHODS: BMI, CAC, and kidney function were measured at baseline. CAC was measured by multislice computed tomography scan. Kidney function was determined by the 4-variable reexpressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. At study end, kidney function decline among patients was compared according to baseline BMI and CAC. MAIN OUTCOME: Kidney function decline was defined as a 1-year decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >=5%. RESULTS: Individuals with a decline in eGFR of >=5% at 1 year had higher baseline BMI (33.5 ± 8.3 vs. 28.4 ± 4.9 kg/m(2); P = .0001) and higher baseline median CAC scores (239 vs. 25 Agatston units; P = .01) compared with subjects without such a decline. BMI (r = 0.35; P < .0001) and logarithmically transformed CAC score (r = 0.22; P = .01) correlated with an eGFR decline of >=5%. Both crude and adjusted logistic regression analyses showed escalating CAC (with CAC reported in quintiles and CAC score = 0 Agatston unit as the reference group) was associated with an increased risk of eGFR decline of >=5%. CONCLUSIONS: CAC and BMI were associated with kidney function decline over 1 year. The risk of kidney function decline was greater in those with increasing burden of CAC, which remained robust in the adjusted analysis accounting for the risk factors for CKD progression. Larger studies will be required for independent validation of the associations of BMI, CAC, and kidney function decline, and to investigate whether obesity and CAC treatment strategies are efficacious in attenuating kidney function decline in predialysis CKD patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to low bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the latter are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the patients, 26% had osteopenia and 7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score (>100 Agatston units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score. Both high CAC and extensive VC were independently predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD has the potential to identify ESRD patients at risk of vascular calcification.

AB  - Background: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have been associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there is no accepted standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications, and most existing methods are simplistic. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a semiquantitative score, one that accounts for all visible calcium on echocardiography, could predict all-cause mortality and stroke in a graded fashion.Methods: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects derived from a general echocardiography database. A global cardiac calcium score (GCCS) was applied that assigned points for calcification in the aortic root and valve, mitral annulus and valve, and submitral apparatus, and points for restricted leaflet mobility. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was stroke.Results: Over a mean 3.8 ± 1.7 years of follow-up, there were 116 deaths and 34 strokes. Crude mortality increased in a graded fashion with increasing GCCS. In unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, the GCCS was significantly associated with total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.35; P < .0001) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = .003). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, history of atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke), these associations remained significant.Conclusions: The GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired echocardiograms and has clinically significant associations with total mortality and stroke.

AB  - Objective: To determine the ability of Coronary Artery Calcification Score (CACS) and carotid ultrasonography in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A set of 104 consecutive RA patients without history of cardiovascular (CV) events were studied to determine CACS, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaques. Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) modified according to the EULAR recommendations (mSCORE) was also assessed. Results: The mean disease duration was 10.8 years, 72.1% had rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP positivity and 16.4% extra-articular manifestations. Nine were excluded because they had type 2 diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. CV risk was categorised in the remaining 95 RA patients according to the mSCORE as follows: low (n=21), moderate (n=60) and high/very high risk (n=14). Most patients with low mSCORE (16/21; 76.2%) had normal CACS (zero), and none of them CACS>100. However, a high number of patients with carotid plaques was disclosed in the groups with CACS 0 (23/40; 57.5%) or CACS 1-100 (29/38; 76.3%). 72 (75.8%) of the 95 patients fulfilled definitions for high/very high CV as they had an mSCORE ≥5% or mSCORE <5% plus one of the following findings: severe carotid ultrasonography findings (cIMT>0.9 mm and/or plaques) or CACS>100. A CACS>100 showed sensitivity similar to mSCORE (23.6% vs 19.4%). In contrast, the presence of severe carotid ultrasonography findings allowed identifying most patients who met definitions for high/very high CV risk (70/72; sensitivity 97.2% (95% CI 90.3 to 99.7)). Conclusions: Carotid ultrasonography is more sensitive than CACS for the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in RA.

AB  - Background and Aims: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are representative markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes remain undetermined.Methods and Results: We included 523 patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been examined with fundus photography for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple radiographs were analyzed for the presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC of the abdominal aorta and iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was evaluated in terms of the rate of renal function decline and composite of any cardiovascular event or death. CKD patients with retinopathy showed higher prevalence of apVC than those without retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001).The presence of retinopathy was independently associated with apVC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate analysis, compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence of both apVC and retinopathy were independently associated with rapid renal function decline (β = -1.51; 95% CI -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were not. Compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite end points were 1.05 (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 1.17, 3.67) for patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with both apVC and retinopathy, respectively.Conclusion: The coexistence of VC and retinopathy was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular events or deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.

AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

AB  - Objective: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher mortality in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to correlate coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Design, Setting, Subjects: A survival analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed by multidetector-row computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0∼105 U), group 2 (110∼1067 U), and group 3 (1094∼15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured. Results: The cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and 52.2%, respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%, respectively). Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration revealed that all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3. Conclusion: CACS is helpful to predict prognosis of HD patients independently of age and HD duration.

AB  - Background: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic angiography. Methods: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD controls (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging software. Results: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non-ESRD, P<0.001 for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 vs. 0.804; P=0.574). Conclusion: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD.

AB  - Background: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are prone to neointimal hyperplasia leading to AVG failure. We hypothesized that pre-existing pathologic abnormalities of the vessels used to create AVGs (including venous intimal hyperplasia, arterial intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification) are associated with inferior AVG survival.Study Design: Prospective observational study.Setting& Participants: Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing placement of a new AVG at a large medical center who had vascular specimens obtained at the time of surgery (n = 76).Predictor: Maximal intimal thickness of the arterial and venous intima, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial medial calcification.Outcome& Measurements: Unassisted primary AVG survival (time to first intervention) and frequency of AVG interventions.Results: 55 patients (72%) underwent interventions and 148 graft interventions occurred during 89.9 years of follow-up (1.65 interventions per graft-year). Unassisted primary AVG survival was not associated significantly with arterial intimal thickness (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.27; P = 0.3), venous intimal thickness (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; P = 0.1), severe arterial medial fibrosis (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.06; P = 0.6), or severe arterial calcification (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37-1.31; P = 0.3). The frequency of AVG interventions per year was associated inversely with arterial intimal thickness (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.42; P < 0.001 for thickness <10 vs. >25 μm), venous intimal thickness (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001 for thickness <5 vs. >10 μm), arterial medial fibrosis (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.96-5.13; P < 0.001 for fibrosis <70% vs. ≥70%), and arterial calcification (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.31-3.43; P = 0.001 for <10% vs. ≥10% calcification).Limitations: Single-center study. Study may be underpowered to demonstrate differences in unassisted primary AVG survival.Conclusions: Pre-existing vascular pathologic abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney disease may not be associated significantly with unassisted primary AVG survival. However, vascular intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification may be associated with a decreased frequency of AVG interventions.

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen on mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary CT as it may serve as a potential marker for increased risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of the imaging database at our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent coronary CT within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary calcium score on CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification by weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for all lesions and expressed as Agaston score. Calculated scores were risk stratified for developing CAD as follows: 0-no risk; 1-10-minimal; 11-100-mild; 101-400-moderate; >400-high risk. Percentile distribution of calcium score adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based on results of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which excluded patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms were reviewed by MQSA-certified breast radiologists who were blinded to patients' coronary calcium scores. Mammograms were interpreted for presence or absence of BAC. The calcium scores and corresponding percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography. Cardiac risk factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient. Results: BAC correlated with coronary calcium score of >11 (p=0.0001), corresponding to mild or greater risk of developing CAD. Specifically, coronary calcium score of >11 was seen in 68% (25/37) of patients with BAC and 31% (34/108) of patients without BAC. Accounting for race, gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically significant correlation with percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4% (19/27) of patients with BAC vs. 44.6% (41/92) of patient without BAC showed percentile score of >25 for developing CAD. Statistically significant association was observed of BAC with diabetes (p=0.01) and chronic renal disease (p=0.005). BAC showed no significant associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD. Conclusion: BAC does predict coronary artery calcium score of >11, which indicates mild or greater risk of developing CAD. In addition, statistically significant correlation exists between BAC and cardiac risk factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our study suggests that BAC on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker for increased risk of developing CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum fetuin-A has been shown to be a strong risk marker for myocardial infarction/stroke in the general population, and has been associated with vascular calcifications in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although these issues are worthy of being addressed in children and adolescents as well, adequate age- and gender-related reference values are missing. METHOD: Within a healthy paediatric population (n = 246), fetuin-A serum concentrations were determined (ELISA kit; Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA) essentially as described by the manufacturer. At the same time, serum protein and serum albumin were measured with established procedures (Beckman Coulter Inc., Krefeld, Germany). Subjects were stratified according to age (<1 yr [n = 25], > or =1 and <6 yr [n = 65], > or =6 and <12 yr [n = 66], > or =12 yr and <16 [n = 45] and > or =16 yr [n = 45]), and both genders were equally distributed within each age cohort. RESULTS: Within each age cohort, fetuin-A serum concentrations were normally distributed, independent of age and gender and the respective reference range (mean +/- 1.96 SD) is 0.22-0.70 g/L (0.46 +/- 0.24 g/L). CONCLUSION: Fetuin-A serum concentrations are independent of age and gender in a healthy paediatric population and are well comparable with those determined in adults with the same assay.

AB  - With the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, people infected with HIV have a longer life expectancy and, consequently, are likely to develop other chronic conditions also found in noninfected people, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Alcohol consumption, which is common among HIV-infected people, may influence the risk of CVD. In noninfected adults, moderate alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attacks, and the most common type of stroke, whereas heavy drinking increases the risk of these cardiovascular events. These relationships can be partially explained by alcohol's effects on various risk factors for CVD, including cholesterol and other lipid levels, diabetes, or blood pressure. In HIV-infected people, both the infection itself and its treatment using combination antiretroviral therapy may contribute to an increased risk of CVD by altering blood lipid levels, inducing inflammation, and impacting bloodclotting processes, all of which can enhance CVD risk. Coinfection with the hepatitis C virus also may exacerbate CVD risk. Excessive alcohol use can further enhance CVD risk in HIV-infected people through either of the mechanisms described above. In addition, excessive alcohol use (as well as HIV infection) promote microbial translocation--the leaking of bacteria or bacterial products from the intestine into the blood stream, where they can induce inflammatory and immune reactions that damage the cardiovascular system.

AB  - The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is high, with an annual risk of amputation estimated at 13%, and indications for limb revascularization in patients combining ESRD with stage IV PAD (foot gangrene) are still controversial. This case-controlled study compared survival, limb salvage, and quality of life in a group of patients hospitalized for foot gangrene according to their renal status (ESRD versus no renal insufficiency). All patients with ESRD hospitalized for foot gangrene (n = 16) from 1996 to 2002 were compared with a control group with normal creatininemia (n = 24) hospitalized for foot gangrene due to peripheral atherosclerotic arterial disease. The 2 groups were matched for age, sex ratio, and number with diabetes mellitus. After a mean follow-up of 467 +/-410 days, patients with ESRD had a more severe prognosis as regards mortality (68.7% vs 12.5%, p = 0.0005) and major amputation (31% versus 8%, p = 0.09). The ESRD group was characterized by more frequent extensive arterial calcifications (16/16 vs 13/24, p = 0.002), owing to a higher level of the calcium phosphorus product (3.54 +/-1.2 vs 2.4 +/-0.6, p = 0.0023), and by impaired microcirculatory perfusion, as indicated by a lower oxygen pressure (TcPO2) (15.6 +/-12 mm Hg vs 26 +/-16, p = 0.07). ESRD implies a poor prognosis in patients with stage IV peripheral arterial disease.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of sock addition and removal on residual-limb fluid volume in people using prosthetic limbs. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure residual-limb extracellular fluid volume on 28 transtibial amputee subjects during 30 min test sessions. Upon addition of a one-ply polyester sock, residual-limb fluid volume changes ranged from -4.0% to 0.8% (mean -0.9 +/-;{1.3%) of the initial limb fluid volume. Changes for sock removal ranged from -1.2% to 2.8% (mean 0.5 +/-{ 0.8%). Subjects who reduced in fluid volume with both addition and removal of a sock and subjects with high positive ratios between the fluid-volume loss upon sock addition and gain upon sock removal (high add/remove [AR] ratios) tended to have arterial disease, were obese, and were smokers. Subjects with low positive AR ratios, subjects who increased in fluid volume both with sock addition and removal, and a single subject who increased in fluid volume with sock addition and decreased with sock removal tended to be nonsmokers and either individuals in good health without complications or individuals without arterial problems. Results are relevant for the anticipation of limb volume changes during prosthetic fitting and toward the design of adjustable-socket technologies.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine how fluid volume changes in the residual limbs of people with transtibial amputation were affected by activity during test sessions with equal durations of resting, standing, and walking. Residual limb extracellular fluid volume was measured using biompedance analysis in 24 participants. Results showed that all subjects lost fluid volume during standing with equal weight-bearing, averaging a loss rate of -0.4%/min and a mean loss over the 25 min test session of 2.6% (standard deviation [SD] 1.1). Sixteen subjects gained limb fluid volume during walking (mean gain of 1.0% [SD 2.5]), and fifteen gained fluid volume during rest (mean gain of 1.0% [SD 2.2]). Walking explained only 39.3% of the total session fluid volume change. There was a strong correlation between walk and rest fluid volume changes (−0.81). Subjects with peripheral arterial disease experienced relatively high fluid volume gains during sitting but minimal changes or losses during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitioning. Healthy female subjects experienced high fluid volume changes during transitioning from sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. The differences in fluid volume response among subjects suggest that volume accommodation technologies should be matched to the activity-dependent fluid transport characteristics of the individual prosthesis user.

AB  - Adding and removing liquid from socket bladders is a means for people with limb loss to accommodate residual-limb volume change. We fit 19 people with transtibial amputation using their regular prosthetic socket with fluid bladders on the inside socket surface to undergo cycles of bladder liquid addition and removal. In each cycle, subjects sat, stood, and walked for 90 s with bladder liquid added, and then sat, stood, and walked for 90 s again with the bladder liquid removed. The amount of bladder liquid added was increased in each cycle. We used bioimpedance analysis to measure residual-limb fluid volume. Results showed that the preferred bladder liquid volume was 16.8 +/- 8.4 mL (mean +/- standard deviation), corresponding with 1.7% +/- 0.8% of the average socket volume between the bioimpedance voltage-sensing electrodes. Residual-limb fluid volume driven out of the residual limb when bladder liquid was added was typically not recovered upon subsequent bladder liquid removal. Of the 19 subjects, 15 experienced a gradual residual-limb fluid volume loss over the test session. Care should be taken when implementing adjustable socket technologies in people with limb loss. Reducing socket volume may accentuate residual-limb fluid volume loss.

AB  - Background/Aims: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. Methods: We performed a single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays. Results: In the final analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism. Conclusions: A prolonged QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

AB  - Purpose: While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for the development and progression of atherosclerosis, it is not known whether arterial inflammation is increased in mild CKD. The aim of this study was to compare arterial inflammation using F-FDG PET/CT in patients with CKD and in matched controls. Methods: This restrospective study included 128 patients undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer history. CKD was defined according to guidelines using a calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. Background FDG uptake (venous, subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact of CKD on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed. Results: Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in matched controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 ± 0.49 vs. 2.16 ± 0.43; p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR ( r = −0.299, p = 0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in patients with CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not differ between groups. Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in patients with CKD compared to controls after correcting for muscle and fat background, and also remained significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC). Conclusion: Moderate CKD is associated with increased arterial inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, the increased arterial inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular events.

AB  - Background: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.Methods: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve dialysis patients.Results: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality rate of 19% (n = 13).Conclusion: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

AB  - Objectives: This study analyzed the outcomes of patients who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy for severe coronary artery calcification (CAC).Background: Patients who present with NSTEMI have increased risk for death and recurrent MI after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with severe CAC have worse outcomes after PCI.Orbital atherectomy modifies calcified plaque, facilitating stent delivery and optimizing stent expansion. There are no data on these patients who present with NSTEMI who undergo orbital atherectomy.Methods: Of the 454 consecutive real-world patients who underwent orbital atherectomy in our retrospective multicenter registry, 51 patients (11.2%) presented with NSTEMI. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30days.Results: Patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, lower mean ejection fraction, and required more vessels to be treated. The primary endpoint was similar in patients who presented with and without NSTEMI (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p=0.9), as were the 30-day rates of death (2.0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.67), MI (0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.42), target vessel revascularization (0% vs. 0%, p>0.91), and stroke (0% vs. 0.2%, p=0.72). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis rate were low in both groups.Conclusions: Despite having worse baseline characteristics, patients who presented with NSTEMI and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy had similar clinical outcomes compared with patients without NSTEMI.

AB  - Background: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).Methods: In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases.Results: Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of the controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis.Conclusions: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause of calciphylaxis.

AB  - Background: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients. Methods: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods. Results: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant only in the patient group. Conclusion: In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

AB  - Background: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. Methods: Eight hundred and twenty-four dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. Results: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges were based on 95% confidence intervals. Conclusions: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve prognostication in this population.

AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of arterial micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD patients. One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operation were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial arterial specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to identify AMiC. We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between positive and negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for evaluating risk factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF failure occurred in 45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was greater in the positive AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group had a lower AVF patency rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The presence of AMiC was an independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion, preexisting AMiC of the vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF failure in incident HD patients.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate rates of residual-limb fluid volume change within one day for people with transtibial limb loss. Rates of fluid volume change during 30 min test sessions of sitting, standing, and walking activities were measured twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, on 12 regular prosthesis users with the use of bioimpedance analysis. Between test sessions, all subjects consumed food and drink, and subject activity ranged from low to high. The rate of fluid volume change within sessions ranged from −8.5 to 5.9 %/h (median: −2.2 %/h). The rate of fluid volume change between sessions ranged from −2.7 to 0.9 %/h (median: −1.0 %/h). The between-session rate of fluid volume change correlated highly with afternoon within-session rates of change (r = 0.9) but was not well correlated with morning within-session rates of change (r = 0.8). Subjects with peripheral arterial complications showed greater fluid volume loss rates during test sessions than between sessions. Rate of fluid volume change may be affected by sitting, standing, and walking activities; presence of peripheral arterial complications; being female; time since amputation; and wearing the socket without doffing for extended periods.

AB  - Background: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl).Methods: In this prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline.Results: Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m2] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m2) completed follow-up. There were no differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m.Conclusions: Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.

AB  - Background: Increased arterial stiffness and vascular calcification have been recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Method: In order to examine the precise temporal link between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular risk at the earliest stages of chronic kidney disease, we studied a cohort of 150 patients with chronic kidney disease (52 stage 2/3 patients, 51 stage 4/5 patients and 47 stage 5D patients). Each patient underwent a plain, lateral lumbar radiograph and an abdominal and thoracic multislice spiral computer tomography scan in order to identify and quantify aortic and coronary calcifications. Pulse wave velocity was used as a measure of arterial stiffness. Results: Regardless of the disease stage, patients with chronic kidney disease had higher adjusted pulse wave velocity than controls with preserved renal function (14.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 m/s, respectively; P < 0.0001). Regarding aortic calcification, there was a gradual but significant rise in later chronic kidney disease stages. A similar trend was found for coronary calcification. In a multivariate analysis only age, mean arterial pressure, diabetes and the aortic calcification score were independent determinants of higher pulse wave velocity. Conclusion: We found that both vascular stiffness and vascular calcification appear early in patients with chronic kidney disease, but only vascular calcification worsens as the disease progresses. The increase of vascular stiffness in adult patients with chronic kidney disease seems to be more related to age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes and vascular calcification than to uremic toxicity.

AB  - Background: Immunoglobulin light chains are classified as middle molecule uremic toxins able to interact with B lymphocyte membranes leading to the activation of transmembrane signaling. The ensuing impairment of neutrophil function can contribute to the chronic inflammation state of uremic patients, and the increased risk of bacterial infections or vascular calcifications. The aim of this crossover observational study was to assess the difference in free light chain removal by three different hemodialysis filters in patients not affected by multiple myeloma.Methods: Free light chain removal was compared in the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane Filtryzer BK-F, the polyphenylene HFR17 filter and the conventional polysulfone filter F7HPS. Twenty chronic hemodialysis patients were enrolled: mean age was 67.7 ± 17.0 years, M/F = 14/6, dialysis vintage (months) 25.5 ± 32.0. The patients were randomized into two groups of treatment lasting 6 weeks each. The dialysis sessions checked were the midweek sessions and the blood was drawn at times 0, 120' and 240'. Kappa (k) and lambda (λ) light chain levels, β2microglobulin (β2M), C reactive protein (CRP) and albumin were checked.Results: K light chain levels were 345.0 ± 100.0 mg/L, λ light chains were 121.4 ± 27.0 mg/L. The values of k light chains at times 120' and 240' were significantly lower with PMMA and HFR17 than those obtained with F7. The reduction ratio per session (RRs) for k light chains was 44.1 ± 4.3% with HFR17, 55.3 ± 3.4% with PMMA, 25.7 ± 8.3% with F7 (p = 0.018). The RRs for λ light chains was 30.3 ± 2.9% with HFR17, 37.8 ± 17.3% with PMMA, 14.0 ± 3.9% with F7 (p = 0.032). As to β2M, RRs was 42.4 ± 3.2% with HFR17 vs. 33.9 ± 2.8% with PMMA vs. 6.3 ± 1.9% with F7 (p = 0.022). The three filters tested showed no differences in CRP or albumin levels.Conclusion: In terms of light chain and β2M removal, the PMMA and on-line HFR filters are similar and both are significantly more effective than the F7 filter in chronic dialysis patients.Trial Registration: The present trial was registered retrospectively ( NCT02950389 , 31/10/2016).

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry.Methods: Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were derived.Results: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression.Conclusions: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary calcification.

AB  - Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC.Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC.Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study.Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital.Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression.Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC.Results: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk factors.Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.Methods: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles.Results: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009).Conclusion: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

AB  - Background: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels.Methods: Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration.Results: 55 % of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067).Conclusion: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased mortality risk.

AB  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation. FACTOR: Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K status. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality and transplant failure. RESULTS: At inclusion, median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7). LIMITATIONS: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney transplantation.
