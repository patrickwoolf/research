AB  - Background: Drug-eluting stents (DES) have significantly reduced in-stent restenosis. But the calcification of coronary artery lesions in hemodialysis patients is a high-risk factor for restenosis after DES implantation. We hypothesized that percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA) may be useful in the prevention of underexpansion and fracture of the stents, thereby reducing major adverse cardiac events.; Methods: We retrospectively compared the primary success and mid-term outcomes (major adverse cardiac events within 12 months) of hemodialysis patients with calcified coronary lesions undergoing DES implantation using PTCRA (n=26) with those where DES was implanted without PTCRA (n=28).; Results: The rates of target lesion revascularization in the PTCRA group were lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (11.5% vs 35.7%, p=0.026). The rates of restenosis and subacute thrombosis in the PTCRA group were modestly lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (restenosis rate, 17.4% vs 17.4%, p=0.061; subacute thrombosis rate, 0% vs 7.1%, p=0.31).; Conclusion: PTCRA may be useful for improving the mid-term outcome of DES implantation in hemodialysis patients with calcified lesions.

AB  - Background: Uterus transplantation is a complex, multi-step experimental procedure used for the treatment of uterus absence or uterus anomaly that prevents embryo implantation or pregnancy completion.; Method: To date, only 51 uterus transplants worldwide had been performed. When simplified, it is vascularized composite allograft transplantation. While it is still an experimental procedure with encouraging results for the future, there are still many issues that have to be clarified. The most serious complications of uterus transplantation are graft rejection or grafts vascular failure.; Results: So far, no reference to the atherosclerotic arterial infiltration of the uterus arteries was suggested and studied as one of the main causes of graft's failure.; Conclusion: In this review we summarized current knowledge and possible role of uterus arterial damage, including atherosclerotic changes on the graft's survival.

AB  - Background and Aim of the Study: The study aim was to determine the correlates of valvular calcification (VC), including clinical and physiologic parameters, in individuals new to dialysis. In addition, the association of VC with coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression and mortality was investigated.; Methods: A total of 101 incident dialysis individuals underwent electrocardiogram-triggered multislice computed tomography (CT) to monitor the presence and quantification of calcification. The average follow up was 2.85 +/- 0.72 years.; Results: Twenty-six (25.7%) patients had only one valve calcified, while 10 (9.9%) had calcifications in both valves. Patients with VC were older, more likely to have a history of diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), more likely to have CAC, and to be Caucasian; fibrinogen and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also higher in these patients. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis revealed older age, history of CVD, increasing fibrinogen, and presence of CAC were independently associated with the presence of VC. Patients with VC also had a higher median annualized CAC progression compared to those without VC (2.90 versus 105.2, p = 0.004). The mortality rate per 100 years was 2.57 in patients without VC, compared to 4.20 and 13.76, respectively, for those with one or two calcified valves. An increasing number of calcified valves was associated with a higher mortality after adjustment for gender and race [HR 2.2 (1.03-4.69), p = 0.04], but was not statistically significant after adjustment for inflammatory markers such as IL-6 or fibrinogen.; Conclusion: Traditional and novel risk factors are associated with the presence of VC, which is a risk marker for CAC progression and mortality in incident dialysis patients.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased mortality risk.

AB  - Aim: Increased arterial stiffness is associated with progressive renal deterioration and poor clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Assessment of vascular age as derived from arterial stiffness parameters might be an important clinical marker of cardiovascular risks. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the difference (△age) between vascular age and chronological age can predict the risk of reaching dialysis or death in patients with known CKD.; Methods: This longitudinal study enrolled 94 male Chinese CKD patients, aged 40-62 years. Vascular age was calculated by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and measured by an ankle-brachial index-form device. The study endpoints were the commencement of renal replacement therapy or death.; Results: After a stepwise multivariate analysis, △age was associated independently with increased urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (β = 0.32; P = 0.001) and decreased baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = -0.24; P = 0.008). During a median follow-up period of 62 (interquartile range = 55-66) months, the 4-year cumulative incidence of reaching the study endpoint in patients with △age = 0 and △age > 0 year was 4.9% and 25%, respectively (log-rank test, P = 0.009). Multivariate forward Cox regression analysis identified that higher △age (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05; P = 0.027), lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR = 0.93; P < 0.001), and history of cardiovascular disease (HR = 5.90; P = 0.031) were independently associated with progression to commencement of dialysis or death.; Conclusion: Thus, the assessment of the difference between vascular age and chronological age may provide an alternative method to identify CKD patients at a high risk of progression to dialysis or death.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is common and may affect cardiac function in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about the effect of residual renal function on vascular calcification and cardiac function in patients on hemodialysis.; Methods: This study was conducted between January 2014 and January 2017. One hundred six patients with residual renal function on maintenance hemodialysis for 3 months were recruited. We used residual renal urea clearance (KRU) to measure residual renal function. First, abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured in patients on hemodialysis. Second, we performed echocardiography and investigated new cardiovascular events after study enrollment.; Results: The median KRU was 0.9 (0.3-2.5) mL/min/1.73m2. AACS (4.0 [1.0-10.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0-8.0], p = 0.05) and baPWV (1836.1 ± 250.4 vs. 1676.8 ± 311.0 cm/s, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2. Log-KRU significantly negatively correlated with log-AACS (ß = -0.29, p = 0.002) and baPWV (ß = -0.19, P = 0.05) after factor adjustment. The proportion of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than with a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (67.9% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.05). Patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 showed a higher tendency of cumulative cardiovascular events compared to those with a KRU ≥ 0.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (P = 0.08).; Conclusions: Residual renal function was significantly associated with vascular calcification and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients on hemodialysis.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) and intradialytic hypotension (IDH) indicate morphological and functional disorders of the cardiovascular system in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes remain undetermined.; Methods: HD patients (n=443) whose plain chest radiographs were examined for aortic arch VC were included. IDH was defined as nadir systolic blood pressure <90mmHg or need for bolus fluid. We investigated the relationship between VC and IDH, and their clinical significance for cardiovascular events (CVEs) and death.; Results: VC was found in 57 HD patients (12.9%). IDH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC (35.1% vs. 18.7%; P=0.004). VC was independently associated with a 2.12-fold increase in the risk of IDH (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.36). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients with neither VC nor IDH, the coexistence of VC and IDH was independently associated with death (hazard ratio [HR], 3.83; 95% CI, 1.62-9.08) and CVE (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.53-9.33), whereas VC or IDH alone was not. Patients with both VC and IDH had the highest risk for a composite event (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.79-7.08). Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and IDH (P for interaction=0.009).; Conclusions: VC was independently associated with IDH. Coexistence of VC and IDH was associated with higher risk of death and CVEs than either factor alone. There was a synergistic interaction between VC and IDH for the risk of a composite event.

AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance HD patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest radiographs were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 100 patients (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC (70% vs. 50.2%, P =0.001). VC was independently associated with a 2.42-fold increased risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was independently associated with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or LVH alone was not. Patients with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a composite event of deaths or CVE (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and LVH ( P for interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently associated with LVH. The coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk of deaths and CVEs than either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic interaction for the risk of deaths and CVEs.

AB  - Unlabelled: The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis population.; Methods: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups.; Results: Thirty-four patients (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other factors in patients with longer dialysis.

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the long-term.; Methods: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting list.; Results: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years.; Conclusions: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced by past dialysis experience. (© 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.)

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD.; Methods: Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale.; Results: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores.; Conclusion: VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association of VC to BMD. (© 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.)

AB  - Background: Several factors suggest that the presence of vascular calcification (VC) is associated with a high risk of cardiac events in uremic patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of VC on cardiac morbidity and mortality in our hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We studied 79 patients on HD: 43 males, mean age 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. The presence of VC was evaluated by radiologic series. Other cardiovascular risk factors analyzed were arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cigarette smoking, anemia, and dyslipidemia. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. During this time, clinical information collected included predialysis blood pressure, incidence of ischemic heart disease, episodes of congestive heart failure, and mortality due to cardiovascular event.; Results: VC was observed in 55.7% of patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac valve calcification were significantly associated with VC. Ischemic heart disease (71.4% vs. 28.6%) and episodes of cardiac failure (0.41 vs. 0.18 per year; P < 0.05) appeared more frequently in the patient group with VC. VC was present in 80.6% of patients who developed episodes of heart failure. Eight patients died from cardiac disease; each of them had VC.; Conclusion: The presence of VC can help to identify those HD patients with a higher cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Introduction: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also determined whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with changes in CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement.; Methods: All patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score, lateral abdominal radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left ventricular mass index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro calibrated to brachial blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard BPro SOFT(®) data into ambulatory CASP.; Results: Ambulatory CASP was not different in those without and with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.2) calcification. Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure to control for peripheral blood pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished: CASP: brachial systolic blood pressure ratio = 0.9 across all categories regardless of the presence of coronary or aortic calcification (p = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Supporting this finding, left ventricular mass index was also not different in those with or without vascular calcification (p = 0.7 and 0.8 for coronary and aortic calcification). Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP correlated excellently with ambulatory measurements (r = 0.9 for both).; Conclusion: Vascular calcification was not associated with changes in ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure in this cohort of prevalent dialysis patients. Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP correlated very well with ambulatory measurement.

AB  - Aim: to look for differences in clinical characteristics, and differences in the role of mineral metabolism disorders and inflammation in diabetic and non diabetic patients.; Methods: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 46 with DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest and lower extremities. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were taken from the medical records.; Results: the overall prevalence of vascular calcification was similar in our haemodialysis patients, with or without DM (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general of older age (58.5+10.3 vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 vs 86+14 mmHg, p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery calcification (13% vs 2.5%, p<0.05). Vascular calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients occurred at the same rate in spite of a lower serum P, (5.7+1.5 vs 6.9+1.5 mg/dl, p<0.05), and Ca X P product (52.3+14.5 vs 60.7+14.5, p<0.05), and shorter HD vintage (1.3+0.9 vs 3.2+3.3 years, p<0.05). In a sub analysis comparing patients according to presence and location of vascular calcification, patients with vascular calcification of the peripheral artery only were mostly diabetics (75%), had lower serum Ca (8.6+0.5mg/dl), P (6.7+0.6mg/dl), Ca x P product (57.4+5.10 mg2/dl2), and higher serum CRP (1.70+1.59mg/dl).; Conclusion: diabetic patients on HD may be at higher risk for peripheral artery calcification, at lower serum Ca, P, and Ca X P product. The higher CRP may indicate a higher inflammatory status, which is probably the major risk factor for vascular calcification of the peripheral artery.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. However, it is difficult to select the proper point for coronary angiographic procedure, because dialysis patients frequently do not display typical symptoms. Vascular calcification (VC) scores of artery or aorta on plain radiographs are associated with CAD events and may be predictive of CAD in dialysis patients. Therefore, we evaluated whether high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs are related with the severity of lesions detected by coronary angiography (CAG) in dialysis patients. We retrospectively enrolled dialysis patients who underwent CAG and checked several plain radiographs within one year before or after CAG. Significant VC is defined as high or meaningful VC scores, such as long abdominal aortic calcification and medial artery calcification on feet. Of all 55 patients, 41 patients (74.5%) exhibited significant VC on plain radiographs and 23 patients (41.8%) underwent stent insertion. Among the 23 patients, longer stents were used in 18 patients with significant VC (34.1 ± 19.5 mm vs. 16.6 ± 15.2 mm, P = 0.029). Patients with significant VC showed higher prevalence rate of severe coronary artery calcification (P = 0.007) and diffuse/tubular stenosis (P = 0.012), detected by CAG, than those without significant VC. Thus, high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs were associated with the degree of calcification or stenosis detected by CAG. In conclusion, VC scores on plain radiographs may be predictive of calcification or stenosis of coronary artery before CAG in dialysis patients.

AB  - Introduction: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients.; Methods: We examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis.; Results: We found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.; Conclusion: There seems to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts are risk factors for VCs.

AB  - Circulating plasma TRAIL levels are suppressed in patients with cardiovascular and diabetic diseases. To identify novel targets in vascular metabolic diseases, genome-wide transcriptome of aortic tissue from Trail -/- versus Trail +/+ mice were interrogated. We found 861 genes differentially expressed with TRAIL deletion. Gene enrichment analyses showed many of these genes were related to inflammation, cell-to-cell cytoskeletal interactions, and transcriptional modulation. We identified vascular protective and pathological gene clusters, with Ifi205 as the most significantly reduced vascular protective gene, whereas Glut1, the most significantly increased pathological gene with TRAIL deletion. We hypothesized that therapeutic targets could be devised from such integrated analysis and validated our findings from vascular tissues of diabetic mice. From the differentially expressed gene targets, enriched transcription factor (TF) and microRNA binding motifs were identified. The top two TFs were Elk1 and Sp1, with enrichment to eight gene targets common to both. miR-520d-3p and miR-377-3p were the top enriched microRNAs with TRAIL deletion; with four overlapping genes enriched for both microRNAs. Our findings offer an alternate in silico approach for therapeutic target identification and present a deeper understanding of gene signatures and pathways altered with TRAIL suppression in the vasculature.

AB  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality.; Methods: In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed.; Results: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from DXA.; Conclusions: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder suggests that fragile bone and vascular disorder might be connected closely in CKD patients. In this study, fracture event was significantly associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (HD), especially for vertebral fractures.; Introduction: CKD-mineral and bone disorder is characterized by biochemical abnormalities, bone disorders, and vascular calcification. We aimed to verify the association between fracture and MI in CKD patients.; Methods: Records for incident CKD stage 3 to 5 patients and patients who initiated HD between July 2014 and June 2018 were retrieved from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service Database. Fractures were defined using diagnostic codes and were classified into vertebral, femoral, and other site fractures. MI was defined using a combination of MI diagnostic codes and related procedure codes. Multiple logistic regressions and 1:1 propensity score matching analysis were conducted.; Results: A total of 38,935 patients (HD, 11,379; pre-dialysis CKD, 27,556) were included in this study. A total of 5,057 (13.0%) patients experienced fracture, and 1,431 (3.7%) patients had MI. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that fracture was significantly associated with MI in the HD group (odds ratio (OR) 1.34, P = 0.024), but not in the pre-dialysis CKD group (OR 1.04, P = 0.701). After propensity score matching for age, gender, and diabetes mellitus between patients with and without fracture, fracture still significantly correlated with MI in HD patients (OR 1.47, P = 0.034) but not in patients with pre-dialysis CKD (OR 1.04, P = 0.751). Subgroup analysis by fracture site found that vertebral fracture was associated with MI in HD patients (OR 2.11, P = 0.024), but femoral or other site fractures were not.; Conclusion: In HD patients, fracture was significantly associated with MI, especially for vertebral fractures patients.

AB  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular calcification. (Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

AB  - Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk.; Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated.; Results: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.; Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.

AB  - Vitamin D has been linked to various cardiovascular risk factors including indices of large-vessel disease. However, it remains unclear whether vitamin D is also associated with microvascular damage. In a community-dwelling population, we studied associations between vitamin D serum levels and retinal microvascular damage defined as retinopathy signs, narrower arterioles, and wider venules.From the population-based Rotterdam Study, we included 5675 participants (age ≥45 years) with vitamin D data and gradable retinal photographs. Serum levels of vitamin D were measured using an antibody-based assay. Retinal exudates, microaneurysms, cotton wool spots, and dot/blot hemorrhages were graded on fundus photographs by experienced graders in the whole sample; retinal vascular calibers, that is, arteriolar and venular diameters, were semiautomatically measured in a subsample (n = 2973). We examined the cross-sectional association between vitamin D and retinal microvascular damage using logistic and linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors.We found that persons with lower vitamin D levels were more likely to have retinopathy (adjusted odds ratio per standard deviation (SD) decrease of vitamin D = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI): = 1.12-1.49). Furthermore, lower vitamin D levels were associated with wider venular calibers (adjusted mean difference per SD decrease in vitamin D = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.64-2.06). This association was strongest among men (P for interaction = 0.023).Lower levels of vitamin D are associated with retinal microvascular damage, suggesting that the link with cardiovascular risk may partly run through changes in the microvasculature.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients.; Objective: We aimed to assess the frequency of, and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in a French dialysis center.; Design: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 and 3.; Results: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency.; Conclusions: Calcidiol deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

AB  - Vitamin K is essential for activation of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins including the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla-protein (MGP). Insufficient vitamin K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly inactive proteins and contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney transplant recipients, cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K intake and status have not been defined. We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular vitamin K status and its determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We estimated vitamin K intake in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients (n = 60) with stable renal function (creatinine clearance 61 [42-77] (median [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 [35-188] months after transplantation, using three-day food records and food frequency questionnaires. Vascular vitamin K status was assessed by measuring plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below the recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with less consumption of green vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased dp-ucMGP levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p<0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP levels were elevated (>500 pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified creatinine clearance, coumarin use, body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and sodium excretion as independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a considerable part of the kidney transplant population, vitamin K intake is too low for maximal carboxylation of vascular MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may result in an increased risk for arterial calcification. Whether increasing vitamin K intake may have health benefits for kidney transplant recipients should be addressed by future studies.

AB  - Background: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear.; Study Design: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design.; Setting & Participants: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation.; Factor: Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K status.; Outcomes: All-cause mortality and transplant failure.; Results: At inclusion, median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7).; Limitations: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point.; Conclusions: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney transplantation. (Copyright © 2015 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to examine arterial stiffness and vitamin K2 status in migraine subjects by comparison to controls.; Background: Migraine is a primary headache disorder that has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Mechanisms underlying this increased risk, however, remain unclear. Vitamin K2 deficiency emerged as a cardiovascular risk factor, but vitamin K2 status has never been explored in migraine subjects.; Design and Methods: This is a case-control, single-center, observational study that includes a cohort of subjects with migraine and their age- and sex-matched controls. Arterial stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix-Gla-protein (dp-ucMGP) was used as a marker for vitamin K2 status. A propensity-matched scoring method was used.; Results: A total of 146 patients (73 matched pairs) were included in this study, of whom 89% were women with a mean age of 31.9 ± 8.4 years. Compared with controls, migraine patients had statistically significantly higher mean cfPWV (7.2 ± 1.1 vs 6.4 ± 0.8 m/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) of mean difference [0.45, 1.08], P < .001), as well as higher dp-ucMGP (454.3 ± 116.7 pmol/L vs 379.8 ± 126.6 pmol/L, 95% CI of mean difference [34.63, 114.31], P < .001). Higher cfPWV was associated with higher dp-ucMGP concentrations only in the migraine with aura (MWA) group. Moreover, migraine subjects had a higher frequency of vitamin K2 deficiency (dp-ucMGP ≥ 500 pmol/L) compared to controls, but this association was not statistically significant (23/73 [31.5%] vs 16/73 [21.9%], P = .193).; Conclusions: Individuals with migraine have worse indices of arterial stiffness as compared with their age- and sex-matched control subjects. This increase in arterial stiffness is associated with an increase in markers of vitamin K2 deficiency in the MWA group. (© 2019 American Headache Society.)

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial stiffness has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING trial (vitamin K2 In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the association between the change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial stiffness following 8 weeks of menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360 μg once daily) among renal transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical vitamin K deficiency was defined as plasma concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 ± 1.5 m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also significantly reduced by 55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a reduction in the prevalence of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When controlled for age, durations of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 24-hour mean arterial pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was independently associated with the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration (P = .014).Among renal transplant recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 supplementation was associated with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency and arterial stiffness.
