abstract = {Abstract - Background Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. Objectives To summarise the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD. Search methods In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head‐to‐head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at‐risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data was pooled using the random‐effects model. Main results We included 50 studies, enrolling 27,139 participants; 44 studies (21,460 participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and six studies (5679 participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (17 studies; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99), but not all‐cause mortality (30 studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (19 studies; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12) or stroke (11 studies; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.72). Antiplatelet agents increased the risk of major (27 studies; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65) and minor bleeding (18 studies; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.97). In terms of dialysis access outcomes, antiplatelet agents reduced access thrombosis or patency failure but had no effect on suitability for dialysis. Meta‐regression analysis indicated no differences in the relative benefit or harms of treatment (risk of all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding) by type of antiplatelet agent or stage of CKD. Limited data were available for direct head‐to‐head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, treatment in kidney transplant recipients, primary prevention, or risk of ESKD. Authors' conclusions Antiplatelet agents reduce myocardial infarction but increase major bleeding. Risks may outweigh benefits among people with low annual risks of cardiovascular events, including those with early stages of CKD who do not have clinically‐evident occlusive cardiovascular disease. Plain language summary Are anti‐blood clotting drugs beneficial for people with chronic kidney disease? People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of heart disease that can block blood supply to the heart or brain causing heart attack or stroke. Drugs that prevent blood clots forming (antiplatelet agents) can prevent deaths caused by clots in arteries in the general adult population. However, there may be fewer benefits for people who have CKD, because blood clots in arteries is a less common cause of death or reason to be admitted to hospital compared with heart failure or sudden death in these people. People with CKD also have an increased tendency for bleeding due to changes in blood clotting mechanisms. Antiplatelet agents may therefore be more hazardous when CKD is present. This review evaluated the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents to prevent cardiovascular disease and death, and improve dialysis vascular access function in people who have CKD. We identified 44 studies comparing antiplatelet agents with placebo or no treatment and six studies directly comparing one antiplatelet agent with another. Antiplatelet agents prevent heart attack, but not death or stroke, and increase major and minor bleeding in people with CKD. Dialysis access (fistula or Gortex graft) is maintained with antiplatelet treatment, but antiplatelet drugs do not clearly improve fistula maturation or suitability for dialysis. Benefits (fewer deaths and heart attacks) and harms (bleeding) occur irrespective of the stage of CKD or type of antiplatelet used. More studies of anti‐blood clotting drugs are needed in people who have CKD, especially in those who have received kidney transplants. We also need studies that compare one anti‐clotting drug versus another, particularly newer drugs, and that determine the best treatment for people with both CKD and acute cardiovascular disease and that assess treatment to improve maturation of dialysis vascular access.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and adverse cardiac events. Screening for CAD is therefore an important part of preoperative evaluation for kidney transplant candidates. There is significant interest in the role of non‐invasive cardiac investigations and their ability to identify patients at high risk of CAD.  Objectives We investigated the accuracy of non‐invasive cardiac screening tests compared with coronary angiography to detect CAD in patients who are potential kidney transplant recipients. Search methods MEDLINE and EMBASE searches (inception to November 2010) were performed to identify studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of non‐invasive screening tests, using coronary angiography as the reference standard. We also conducted citation tracking via Web of Science and handsearched reference lists of identified primary studies and review articles.   Selection criteria We included in this review all diagnostic cross sectional, cohort and randomised studies of test accuracy that compared the results of any cardiac test with coronary angiography (the reference standard) relating to patients considered as potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney‐pancreas transplantation at the time diagnostic tests were performed.  Data collection and analysis We used a hierarchical modelling strategy to produce summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, and pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity analyses to determine test accuracy were performed if only studies that had full verification or applied a threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography for the diagnosis of significant CAD were included. Main results The following screening investigations included in the meta‐analysis were: dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) (13 studies), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) (nine studies), echocardiography (three studies), exercise stress electrocardiography (two studies), resting electrocardiography (three studies), and one study each of electron beam computed tomography (EBCT), exercise ventriculography, carotid intimal media thickness (CIMT) and digital subtraction fluorography (DSF). Sufficient studies were present to allow hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) analysis for DSE and MPS. When including all available studies, both DSE and MPS had moderate sensitivity and specificity in detecting coronary artery stenosis in patients who are kidney transplant candidates [DSE (13 studies) ‐ pooled sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.88), pooled specificity 0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.94); MPS (nine studies) ‐ pooled sensitivity 0.74 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.87), pooled specificity 0.70 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84)]. When limiting to studies which defined coronary artery stenosis using a reference threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography, there was little change in these pooled estimates of accuracy [DSE (9 studies) ‐ pooled sensitivity 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.87), specificity 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.94); MPS (7 studies) ‐ pooled sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.82), pooled specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.88)]. There was evidence that DSE had improved accuracy over MPS (P = 0.02) when all studies were included in the analysis, but this was not significant when we excluded studies which did not avoid partial verification or use a reference standard threshold of ≥70% stenosis (P = 0.09).   Authors' conclusions DSE may perform better than MPS but additional studies directly comparing these cardiac screening tests are needed. Absence of significant CAD may not necessarily correlate with cardiac‐event free survival following transplantation. Further research should focus on assessing the ability of functional tests to predict postoperative outcome. Plain language summary [Summary title] [Summary text]},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Millions of people worldwide suffer from hepatitis C, which can lead to severe liver disease, liver cancer, and death. Direct‐acting antivirals (DAAs), e.g. sofosbuvir, are relatively new and expensive interventions for chronic hepatitis C, and preliminary results suggest that DAAs may eradicate hepatitis C virus (HCV) from the blood (sustained virological response). Sustained virological response (SVR) is used by investigators and regulatory agencies as a surrogate outcome for morbidity and mortality, based solely on observational evidence. However, there have been no randomised trials that have validated that usage. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of DAAs in people with chronic HCV. Search methods We searched for all published and unpublished trials in The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and BIOSIS; the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China Network Knowledge Information (CNKI), the Chinese Science Journal Database (VIP), Google Scholar, The Turning Research into Practice (TRIP) Database,  ClinicalTrials.gov , European Medicines Agency (EMA) ( www.ema.europa.eu/ema/ ), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( www.who.int/ictrp ), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ( www.fda.gov ), and pharmaceutical company sources for ongoing or unpublished trials. Searches were last run in October 2016. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials comparing DAAs versus no intervention or placebo, alone or with co‐interventions, in adults with chronic HCV. We included trials irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were hepatitis C‐related morbidity, serious adverse events, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepato‐renal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, non‐serious adverse events (each reported separately), and SVR. We systematically assessed risks of bias, performed Trial Sequential Analysis, and followed an eight‐step procedure to assess thresholds for statistical and clinical significance. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence, using GRADE. Main results We included a total of 138 trials randomising a total of 25,232 participants. The trials were generally short‐term trials and designed primarily to assess the effect of treatment on SVR. The trials evaluated 51 different DAAs. Of these, 128 trials employed matching placebo in the control group. All included trials were at high risk of bias. Eighty‐four trials involved DAAs on the market or under development (13,466 participants). Fifty‐seven trials administered DAAs that were discontinued or withdrawn from the market. Study populations were treatment‐naive in 95 trials, had been exposed to treatment in 17 trials, and comprised both treatment‐naive and treatment‐experienced individuals in 24 trials. The HCV genotypes were genotype 1 (119 trials), genotype 2 (eight trials), genotype 3 (six trials), genotype 4 (nine trials), and genotype 6 (one trial). We identified two ongoing trials. We could not reliably determine the effect of DAAs on the market or under development on our primary outcome of hepatitis C‐related morbidity or all‐cause mortality. There were no data on hepatitis C‐related morbidity and only limited data on mortality from 11 trials (DAA 15/2377 (0.63%) versus control 1/617 (0.16%); OR 3.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 26.18, very low‐quality evidence). We did not perform Trial Sequential Analysis on this outcome. There is very low quality evidence that DAAs on the market or under development do not influence serious adverse events (DAA 5.2% versus control 5.6%; OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.15 , 15,817 participants, 43 trials). The Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there was sufficient information to rule out that DAAs reduce the relative risk of a serious adverse event by 20% when compared with placebo. The only DAA that showed a lower risk of serious adverse events when meta‐analysed separately was simeprevir (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). However, Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there was not enough information to confirm or reject a relative risk reduction of 20%, and when one trial with an extreme result was excluded, the meta‐analysis result showed no evidence of a difference. DAAs on the market or under development may reduce the risk of no SVR from 54.1% in untreated people to 23.8% in people treated with DAA (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.52, 6886 participants, 32 trials, low quality evidence). Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this meta‐analysis result. Only 1/84 trials on the market or under development assessed the effects of DAAs on health‐related quality of life (SF‐36 mental score and SF‐36 physical score). There was insufficient evidence from trials on withdrawn or discontinued DAAs to determine their effect on hepatitis C‐related morbidity and all‐cause mortality (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.79; 5 trials, very low‐quality evidence). However, these DAAs seemed to increase the risk of serious adverse events (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73; 29 trials, very low‐quality evidence). Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this meta‐analysis result. None of the 138 trials provided useful data to assess the effects of DAAs on the remaining secondary outcomes (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepato‐renal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma). Authors' conclusions The evidence for our main outcomes of interest come from short‐term trials, and we are unable to determine the effect of long‐term treatment with DAAs. The rates of hepatitis C morbidity and mortality observed in the trials are relatively low and we are uncertain as to how DAAs affect this outcome. Overall, there is very low quality evidence that DAAs on the market or under development do not influence serious adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to judge if DAAs have beneficial or harmful effects on other clinical outcomes for chronic HCV. Simeprevir may have beneficial effects on risk of serious adverse event. In all remaining analyses, we could neither confirm nor reject that DAAs had any clinical effects. DAAs may reduce the number of people with detectable virus in their blood, but we do not have sufficient evidence from randomised trials that enables us to understand how SVR affects long‐term clinical outcomes. SVR is still an outcome that needs proper validation in randomised clinical trials. Plain language summary Direct‐acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C Background   Millions of people worldwide suffer from hepatitis C, which can lead to severe liver disease, liver cancer, and death. Numerous previous interferon‐based interventions have been used for hepatitis C, but none of these interventions have proven effective on patient‐centred outcomes and their use was associated with serious side‐effects. DAAs are relatively new but expensive interventions for hepatitis C, and preliminary results have shown that DAAs seem to eradicate hepatitis C virus from the blood (sustained virological response) much more frequently. In addition, these agents do appear to create much less serious adverse‐effects. In this Cochrane Review, we assessed the evidence on the clinical effects of DAAs for hepatitis C. Study characteristics   We included 138 randomised clinical trials. All included trials were at high risk of bias. The 138 trials used 51 different DAAs. Of these, 84 trials assessed DAAs on the market or under development; 57 trials were on DAAs withdrawn from development or the market. Trials were conducted from 2004 to 2016. The trials were from all over the world including 34 different countries. We included 17 trials where all the participants had previously been treated for hepatitis C (treatment‐experienced) before being included in the trial. There were 95 trials that included only participants who had not been previously treated for hepatitis C (treatment‐naive). The intervention periods ranged from one day to 48 weeks with an average of 14 weeks. The combined intervention period and follow‐up period ranged from one day to 120 weeks with an average of 34 weeks. Key results   We could not reliably determine the effect of DAAs on hepatitis C‐related morbidity or death from any cause. There were no data on hepatitis C‐related morbidity and very few deaths occurred over the course of the trials (15 deaths/2377 direct‐acting antiviral participants (0.63%) versus 1 death/617 control participants (0.16%), very low quality evidence). Based on very low quality evidence, 5.2% people treated with DAAs had one or more serious adverse events versus 5.6% participants who were untreated during the observation period. When analysed separately, simeprevir was the only direct‐acting antiviral that showed evidence of a beneficial effect when assessing risk of a serious adverse event. Our analyses, however, showed that the validity of this result is questionable and that 'play of chance' might be the cause for the difference. There was not enough information to determine if there was any effect of DAAs on other clinically relevant outcomes. Our results confirm that DAAs seem to reduce the number of people who have the hepatitis C virus in their blood from 54.1% in untreated people to 23.8% in those who were treated. Because the loss of detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood stream is only a blood test, the studies could not tell what this result means in the long term. Quality of the evidence   Due to several limitations (e.g. lack of blinding, lack of relevant data, missing data, no published protocol) we assessed the quality of the evidence in this review as very low or low quality. First, all trials and outcome results were at high risk of bias, which means that our results presumably overestimate the beneficial effects of DAAs and underestimate any potential harmful effects. Second, there were limited data on most of our clinical outcomes, that is, there were only relevant clinical data for meta‐analyses on all‐cause mortality and serious adverse events, and for these, data were sparse. There are no long‐term trials that have assessed whether or not DAA treatment improves morbidity or mortality.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Elevation of pulmonary pressure is no longer a rare disease, given its multifactorial etiology. However data on the actual incidence of this condition are still limited, and controversies regarding its management are ongoing. Use of anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension is based on the presence of in situ thrombosis in the patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and on retrospective evidence of clinical benefit. Current practice is dependent mostly on expert opinion and individualised experience. The real benefit of its use in different types of pulmonary hypertension is still debatable, and the therapeutic target of the international normalised ratio (INR) among treated patients remains inconclusive. Adverse outcomes associated with anticoagulants are significant and can include fatal haemorrhage. Justification for the use of this intervention requires critical evaluation of randomised controlled trials. Objectives 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of, and potential adverse events associated with, anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH). 2. To evaluate the effective therapeutic INR in pulmonary hypertensive patients receiving anticoagulants (North American centres 1.5 to 2.5, European centres 2.0 to 3.0). Search methods We identified trials through searches of the following databases. Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of  The Cochrane Library ; MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (EBSCOhost); Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. The trial search date was 28 March 2014. Selection criteria We planned to include only randomised controlled trials. Participants with PH with co‐morbidities including medical conditions requiring long‐term anticoagulation were to be included. We also planned to include trials comparing any anticoagulant with placebo. Data collection and analysis Review authors (IE and HE) independently appraised all identified citations to establish their relevance for inclusion in the review. IE and HE independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified potential studies for inclusion. Main results No eligible trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Authors' conclusions No eligible studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Although our review of available non‐randomised studies shows beneficial effect, this finding should be interpreted with caution since there are likely to be biases associated with their design and our methods were not designed to identify, appraise and summarise evidence from them. So that better decisions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this intervention, well‐designed randomised controlled trials are needed. Plain language summary Blood thinners for pulmonary hypertension Background The heart has four chambers: two upper and two lower chambers. The lower right chamber, also known as the right ventricle, pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where the blood receives oxygen. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when pressure in the pulmonary arteries is increased to above normal (8 to 25 mmHg). When this happens over time, inflammation of the pulmonary artery occurs. The arteries may then become stiff and tighten. These changes make it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. The heart becomes weaker as it tries to push against this pressure; the resulting disturbance to blood flow can lead to blood clots. These clots can travel to the lungs, which can worsen the person's condition and may result in death. People with pulmonary hypertension may complain of tiredness, chest pain and shortness of breath during normal activities like walking and running, which may progress to affect all physical activities. Prospects of survival depend on several factors, but pregnancy is strongly associated with poor survival. Treatment of this disease is multi‐faceted and includes rehabilitation, psychosocial support and surgical and medical treatment. Medical treatment includes the use of blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban. Blood thinners work by preventing the formation of clot. The blood thinner of choice, warfarin, needs close monitoring with daily to weekly laboratory testing to maintain the therapeutic target; this monitoring may be difficult to keep up with. The major side effect of blood thinners is bleeding, which can manifest as easy bruising, bleeding in the digestive tract and bleeding into the brain; severe cases can be fatal. Review question We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of blood thinners in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. No eligible studies (randomised controlled trials) were found. Review of other studies (non‐randomised controlled trials) shows the effectiveness of this intervention. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of evidence provided by these studies. Conclusion No randomised evidence is available. We decided to look at the results of other studies (non‐randomised control trials). They provide only poor quality evidence of effectiveness of this intervention, and the results should be interpreted with caution. We are uncertain as to how far the results of studies with this design can be believed, and our own approach was not designed to properly look for them and incorporate them in our systematic review. This review therefore highlights the need for appropriately designed randomised controlled trials.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega‐3 PUFA and plant oils in omega‐6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA‐rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear. Objectives To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta‐analyses used random‐effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed‐effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence. Main results We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has  little or no effect on all‐cause mortality  (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but  probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events  from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and  cardiovascular disease events  from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate‐quality evidence. Increasing PUFA  may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death  (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) and stroke  (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has  little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality  (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low‐quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on  major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events  and  atrial fibrillation  are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake  probably slightly decreases triglycerides  (by 15%, MD ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.20 to ‐0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on  total cholesterol  (mean difference (MD) ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.23 to ‐0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants), high‐density lipoprotein  (HDL)  (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low‐density lipoprotein  (LDL)  (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably has  little or no effect on adiposity  (body weight MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on  serious adverse events  such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality. Authors' conclusions This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all‐cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via TG reduction. Plain language summary Polyunsaturated fatty acids for prevention and treatment of diseases of the heart and circulation Review question We reviewed randomised trials (participants have an equal chance to be assigned to either treatment) examining effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on deaths and diseases of the heart and circulation (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attacks and stroke. Background We eat PUFA in our usual food, but quantities of PUFA eaten vary. There is some evidence that increasing the amount of PUFA we eat can reduce our blood cholesterol and make us less likely to develop cardiovascular disease, particularly if PUFAs are eaten instead of saturated fats (fats from animal sources such as meat and cheese). But eating more PUFA may increase our body weight, and omega‐6 fats (one component of PUFA) may worsen cardiovascular risk by increasing inflammation. Evidence on the benefits or harms of increasing PUFA intake on diseases of the heart and circulation, or on other health outcomes, is inconclusive. Trial characteristics Evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 27 April 2017. We included 49 trials randomising 24,272 participants, for one to eight years. These trials assessed effects of eating more, compared to less PUFA, on diseases of the heart and circulation, and deaths. Twelve trials were very trustworthy (had low risk of bias overall). Participants were men and women, some with existing illnesses and some not. Trials took place in North America, Asia, Europe and Australia, and sixteen were funded only by national or charitable agencies. Key results Increasing PUFA probably makes little or no difference (neither benefit nor harm) to our risk of death (moderate‐quality evidence), and may make little or no difference to our risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (low‐quality evidence). However, increasing PUFA probably slightly reduces our risk of heart disease events and of combined heart and stroke events (moderate‐quality evidence). Fifty three people would need to eat more PUFA to prevent one person experiencing a heart disease event, and 63 people to prevent one person experiencing a heart or stroke event. Increasing PUFA may very slightly reduce risk of death due to heart disease, as well as stroke, but harm is possible (low‐quality evidence). PUFA probably slightly reduces fats circulating in the blood (triglycerides, moderate‐quality evidence but without effects on other lipids or adiposity). The evidence mainly comes from dietary‐advice trials of men living in high‐income countries.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can lead to disabling ischemia and limb loss. Treatment modalities have included risk factor optimization through life‐style modifications and medications, or operative approaches using both open and minimally invasive techniques, such as balloon angioplasty. Drug‐eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty has emerged as a promising alternative to uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of this difficult disease process. By ballooning and coating the inside of atherosclerotic vessels with cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, cellular mechanisms responsible for atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia are inhibited and its devastating complications are prevented or postponed. DEBs are considerably more expensive than uncoated balloons, and their efficacy in improving patient outcomes is unclear. Objectives To assess the efficacy of drug‐eluting balloons (DEBs) compared with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty in people with symptomatic lower‐limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched December 2015) and Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (2015, Issue 11). The TSC searched trial databases for details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials that compared DEBs with uncoated, nonstenting balloon angioplasty for intermittent claudication (IC) or critical limb ischemia (CLI). Data collection and analysis Two review authors (AK, TA) independently selected the appropriate trials and performed data extraction, assessment of trial quality, and data analysis. The senior review author (DKR) adjudicated any disagreements. Main results Eleven trials that randomized 1838 participants met the study inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials included femoropopliteal arterial lesions, three included tibial arterial lesions, and one included both. The trials were carried out in Europe and in the USA and all used the taxane drug paclitaxel in the DEB arm. Nine of the 11 trials were industry‐sponsored. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices (Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic). The trials examined both anatomic and clinical endpoints. There was heterogeneity in the frequency of stent deployment and the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy between trials. Using GRADE assessment criteria, the quality of the evidence presented was moderate for the outcomes of target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category, and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle‐brachial index (ABI). Most participants were followed up for 12 months, but one trial reported outcomes at five years. There were better outcomes for DEBs for up to two years in primary vessel patency (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 9.57 at six months; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.56 at 12 months; OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.26 to 5.46 at two years) and at six months and two years for late lumen loss (mean difference (MD) ‐0.64 mm, 95% CI ‐1.00 to ‐0.28 at six months; MD ‐0.80 mm, 95% CI ‐1.44 to ‐0.16 at two years). DEB were also superior to uncoated balloon angioplasty for up to five years in target lesion revascularization (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47 at six months; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.51 at 12 months; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.44 at two years; OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.51 at five years) and binary restenosis rate (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67 at six months; OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98 at 12 months; OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66 at two years; OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.30 at five years). There was no significant difference between DEB and uncoated angioplasty in amputation, death, change in ABI, change in Rutherford category and quality of life (QoL) scores, or functional walking ability, although none of the trials were powered to detect a significant difference in these clinical endpoints. We carried out two subgroup analyses to examine outcomes in femoropopliteal and tibial interventions as well as in people with CLI (4 or greater Rutherford class), and showed no advantage for DEBs in tibial vessels at six and 12 months compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. There was also no advantage for DEBs in CLI compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty at 12 months. Authors' conclusions Based on a meta‐analysis of 11 trials with 1838 participants, there is evidence of an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty in several anatomic endpoints such as primary vessel patency (high‐quality evidence), binary restenosis rate (moderate‐quality evidence), and target lesion revascularization (low‐quality evidence) for up to 12 months. Conversely, there is no evidence of an advantage for DEBs in clinical endpoints such as amputation, death, or change in ABI, or change in Rutherford category during 12 months' follow‐up. Well‐designed randomized trials with long‐term follow‐up are needed to compare DEBs with uncoated balloon angioplasties adequately for both anatomic and clinical study endpoints before the widespread use of this expensive technology can be justified. Plain language summary Uncoated balloon angioplasty versus drug‐eluting balloon angioplasty for peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is a widespread condition that affects many people. In its advanced form, PAD can lead to pain, infections, and amputation. People with PAD are usually first treated with medicines and lifestyle modifications including strategies to stop smoking and a walking program to optimize their general health. People who require an operation might have a traditional open surgery or a less invasive procedure known as angioplasty, which uses a balloon to open the blockages in the arteries. A new type of angioplasty, known as drug‐eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty, has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with PAD. By using DEBs to balloon and coat the inside of the blood vessels (tubes that carry blood around the body) with medicines to treat cancer (chemotherapy) such as paclitaxel, the hope is to halt the progression of PAD and prevent or postpone its devastating complications. The goal of this review was to determine how DEB angioplasty compares with traditional balloon angioplasty for the treatment of PAD of the lower limbs. Study characteristics and key results Our review included 11 clinical trials that randomized 1838 participants (current until December 2015). The trials included thigh and leg arteries above and below the knee. The trials were carried out in Europe and the USA, and all used DEBs that contained paclitaxel. Four companies manufactured the DEB devices: Bard, Bavaria Medizin, Biotronik, and Medtronic. Most participants were followed for 12 or more months (called follow‐up). At six and 12 months of follow‐up, DEBs were associated with improved primary vessel patency, which is an indicator of whether a vessel is still patent without any further interventions (blood flowing well), late lumen loss, which is the difference in millimeters between the angioplastied segment and how narrow it is on follow‐up, target lesion revascularization, which is an indicator of whether a person received more than one treatment to the same artery during the period covered by the study, and binary restenosis, which occurs when a treated artery becomes narrowed again after being previously treated. Unfortunately, early anatomic (structural) advantages of DEBs were not accompanied by improvements in quality of life, functional walking ability, or in the occurrence of amputation or death. When we specifically examined arteries below the knee and people who had very advanced PAD, we found no clinical or angiographic advantage for DEBs at 12 months of follow‐up compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty. In summary, DEBs have several anatomic advantages over uncoated balloons for the treatment of lower limb PAD for up to 12 months after undergoing the procedure. However, more data are needed to assess the long‐term results of this treatment option adequately. Quality of the evidence All the trials had differences in the way in which they inserted the balloons, and in the type and duration of additional antiplatelet (anticlotting) therapy, leading to downgrading of the quality of the evidence. The quality of the evidence presented was moderate for target lesion revascularization and change in Rutherford category (a way of classifying PAD), and high for amputation, primary vessel patency, binary restenosis, death, and change in ankle‐brachial index (which is used to predict the severity of PAD).},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Some groups of people have a greater risk of developing common non‐melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Objectives To evaluate interventions for preventing NMSC in people at high risk of developing NMSC. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( The Cochrane Library Issue  1, 2007, MEDLINE (from 2003 to March 2007), EMBASE (from 2005 to March 2007), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (February 2007). References from trials and reviews were also searched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of adults and children at high risk of developing NMSC. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies and assessed their methodological quality. Main results We identified 10 trials (7,229 participants) that assessed a variety of interventions. One trial found T4N5 liposome lotion significantly reduced the rate of appearance of new BCCs in people with xeroderma pigmentosum. One of three trials of renal transplant recipients showed a significantly reduced risk of new NMSCs when acitretin was compared to placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.22 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.90) and no significant difference in risk of adverse events in two trials (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.61). In three trials conducted in people with a history of NMSC, the evidence was inconclusive for the development of BCCs for retinol or isoretinoin. However the risk of a new SCC in one trial (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.76) and adverse events in another trial (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.97) were significantly increased in the isotretinoin group compared with placebo. In one trial selenium showed a reduced risk of other types of cancer compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85) but also a significantly elevated risk of a new NMSC (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34). The evidence for one trial of beta‐carotene was inconclusive; and there was a trend towards fewer new NMSC in a trial of a reduced fat diet (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31), p = 0.09. Authors' conclusions Some preventative treatments may benefit people at high risk of developing NMSC, but the ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by small numbers of trials, often with one trial per intervention or with inconsistent results between studies. Plain language summary Interventions for preventing of non‐melanoma skin cancers in high‐risk groups Non‐melanoma skin cancer is still the most common cancer in the UK, the United States and Australia. People at increased risk of getting non‐melanoma skin cancer include those with lowered immunity, a history of non‐melanoma skin cancer, rare inherited genetic skin disorders, trauma to the skin, exposure to arsenic, albinism or having had psoralen and ultraviolet A treatment. Very few studies have been conducted in people at increased risk of NMSC. For people with Xeroderma pigmentosum (a rare inherited genetic skin disorder) topical application of T4N5 liposome lotion is beneficial in reducing the rate of appearance of new basal cell carcinomas, however it may increase the risk of a new squamous cell carcinoma. Acitretin in renal transplant recipients may be of some benefit, however, high doses of acitretin are associated with an increased number of adverse events. Retinol or a reduced fat diet may be worth trying for people with a history of non‐melanoma skin cancer. Further prevention studies for people at increased risk of non‐melanoma skin cancer are needed.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Vitamin D compounds are used to suppress elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Objectives To assess the efficacy of vitamin D therapy on biochemical, bone, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes in people with CKD and not requiring dialysis. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different forms, schedules, or routes of administration of vitamin D compounds for people with CKD not requiring dialysis were included. Vitamin D compounds were defined as established (calcitriol, alfacalcidol, 24,25(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 ) or newer (doxercalciferol, maxacalcitol, paricalcitol, falecalcitriol) vitamin D compounds. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by two authors. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. Results were summarized as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Sixteen studies (894 patients) were included. No formulation, route, or schedule of vitamin D compound was found to alter the mortality risk or need for dialysis. Vitamin D compounds significantly lowered serum PTH (4 studies, 153 patients: MD ‐49.34 pg/mL, 95% CI ‐85.70 to ‐12.97 (‐5.6 pmol/L, 95% CI ‐9.77 to ‐1.48)) and were more likely to reduce serum PTH > 30% from baseline value (264 patients: RR 7.87, 95% CI 4.87 to 12.73). Vitamin D treatment was associated with increased end of treatment serum phosphorus (3 studies, 140 patients: MD 0.37 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.09, 0.66 (0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.03, 0.21)) and serum calcium (5 studies, 184 patients: MD 0.20 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.23 (0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.06)). Few data were available comparing intermittent with daily vitamin D administration, or other schedules of dosing. Authors' conclusions There are not sufficient data to determine the effect of vitamin D compounds on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in people with CKD not requiring dialysis. While vitamin D compounds reduce serum PTH (49.3 pg/mL (5.6 pmol/L)) compared with placebo, the relative clinical benefits of PTH lowering versus treatment‐related increases in serum phosphorus and calcium remain to be understood. Plain language summary Vitamin D compounds for people with chronic kidney disease not requiring dialysis People with lower kidney function (chronic kidney disease; CKD) develop changes in circulating blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. The kidney gradually loses the ability to remove phosphorus from the blood and cannot activate adequate amounts of vitamin D to maintain normal levels of calcium. The parathyroid gland senses these changes and compensates to increase calcium by elevating production and release of parathyroid hormone (PTH). These metabolic changes alter bone metabolism to release calcium and accordingly lead to bone abnormalities including altered bone production. In turn, bony changes may result in bone deformation, bone pain, and altered risks of fracture. Treatment for these mineral changes in CKD include replacing activated vitamin D to suppress parathyroid hormone release. Earlier activated vitamin D preparations (calcitriol and alfacalcidol) were associated with increased circulating calcium and phosphorus through their direct action on the vitamin D receptor. Newer agents have since been developed that similarly suppress parathyroid hormone but limit changes in calcium and phosphorus. Avoidance of increased calcium and phosphorus is considered important as these minerals may activate calcification in arteries and tissues, potentially leading to heart disease and tissue damage. We identified 16 studies of vitamin D preparations in people with CKD and not requiring dialysis (less severe CKD) involving 894 people. No studies were designed to understand the effect of vitamin D therapy on risks of premature cardiovascular disease or mortality. Vitamin D agents lowered PTH significantly compared with no treatment, however also increased both calcium and phosphorus levels. Newer vitamin D therapies have not been compared with older vitamin compounds in CKD directly; whether they are associated with increased calcium and phosphorus is uncertain. In the future, new studies are required to assess outcomes important to patients, such as life expectancy and premature heart disease. It will also be important to know if vitamin D therapy should be used differently (differing target levels of PTH) in differing stages of CKD.},

Observational data also indicate vitamin D therapy may be independently associated with reduced mortality in CKD. Objectives We assessed the effects of vitamin D compounds on clinical, biochemical, and bone outcomes in people with CKD and receiving dialysis. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in subjects with CKD and requiring dialysis that assessed treatment with vitamin D compounds. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted by two authors. Results are summarised as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results Sixty studies (2773 patients) were included. No formulation, route, or schedule of administration was associated with altered risks of death, bone pain, or parathyroidectomy. Marked heterogeneity in reporting of outcomes resulted in few data available for formal meta‐analysis. Compared with placebo, vitamin D compounds lowered serum PTH at the expense of increasing serum phosphorus. Trends toward increased hypercalcaemia and serum calcium did not reach statistical significance but may be clinically relevant. Newer vitamin D compounds (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol, doxercalciferol) lowered PTH compared with placebo, with increased risks of hypercalcaemia, although inadequate data were available for serum phosphorus. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH compared with oral treatment, and be associated with lower serum phosphorus and calcium levels, although limitations in the available studies precludes a conclusive statement of treatment efficacy. Few studies were available for intermittent versus daily and intraperitoneal versus oral administration or directly comparative studies of newer versus established vitamin D compounds. Authors' conclusions We confirm that vitamin D compounds suppress PTH in people with CKD and requiring dialysis although treatment is associated with clinical elevations in serum phosphorus and calcium. All studies were inadequately powered to assess the effect of vitamin D on clinical outcomes and until such studies are conducted the relative importance of changes in serum PTH, phosphorus and calcium resulting from vitamin D therapy remain unknown. Observational data showing vitamin D compounds may be associated with improved survival in CKD need to be confirmed or refuted in specifically designed RCTs.

No studies were designed to understand the effect of vitamin D therapy on risks of death. Vitamin D agents suppress PTH significantly compared with no treatment, however also increase both circulating calcium and phosphorus levels. Intravenous vitamin D may lower PTH more than oral vitamin D. Few studies directly compare newer vitamin D therapies with earlier (and presently more common treatment options; calcitriol and alfacalcidol); newer treatment options therefore cannot be recommended as superior to established treatments. In the future, new studies will required to know if vitamin D effects on parathyroid function improve survival, bone pain, and need for parathyroid removal by surgery. It is possible that vitamin D compounds are beneficial to patients regardless of their effects on parathyroid hormone. This can only be adequately evaluated by conducting specific studies that are large enough to be sure of any treatment differences.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta‐analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review. Objectives To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other "herbal" medications. Search methods We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched. Selection criteria All randomized or quasi‐randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other "herbal" supplements such as glucosamine. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Main results Forty‐three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0‐100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T 2  = 0.07; I 2  = 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T 2  = 0.18; I 2  = 83% ), again with low level of evidence. For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T 2  = 0.00; I 2  = 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain,function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T 2 = 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not. Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0‐100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T 2  = 0.33; I 2  = 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T 2  = 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T 2  = 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control. The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (> 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding. Authors' conclusions A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short‐term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both likely clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high‐quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over‐the‐counter supplement. Plain language summary Chondroitin for osteoarthritis We conducted a review of the effects of chondroitin sulfate for people with osteoarthritis. We found 43 studies with 9,110 people after searching for studies up to November 2013. Majority were studies of knee osteoarthritis (few hand, one hip) ranging from 1 month to 3 years. Several studies were funded by makers of chondroitin. This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis: ‐ Chondroitin may improve pain slightly in the short‐term (less than 6 months); ‐ Chondroitin improves knee pain by 20% in slightly more people; ‐ Chondroitin probably improves quality of life slightly as measured by Lequesne's index (combined measure of pain, function, and disability); ‐ Chondroitin has little or no difference in adverse and serious adverse events versus other agents; and ‐ Chondroitin slightly slows down the narrowing of joint space on X‐rays of the affected joint. We identified a lot of studies in which unsound methods were used to assess the effects of chondroitin. For some outcomes, there was not enough data. In some studies, whose methodological quality was better, chondroitin showed no improvement in pain and in physical function. Other analyses based on different methodological quality criteria reported improvement in pain and physical functionality when chondroitin was given. What is osteoarthritis and what is chondroitin? Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints, such as the knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage, but this bone growth may make the situation worse. This can make the joint painful and unstable, which can affect physical function or ability to use the joint. Chondroitin is an over‐the‐counter nutritional supplement made primarily of chondroitin sulfate. It is said to work by stopping the degradation of cartilage and restoring lost cartilage. It also contains sulfur‐containing amino acids, which are essential building blocks for cartilage molecules in the human body. What happens to people with osteoarthritis who take chondroitin? Pain level after 6 months (lower score is better) ‐ People who took chondroitin scored 10 points lower on 0 to 100 pain scale than those who took a placebo (10% absolute difference). ‐ People who took chondroitin rated their pain at 18 on a 0 to 100 scale. ‐ People who took placebo rated their pain at 28 on a 0 to 100 scale. In studies longer than 6 months, we are uncertain whether pain is reduced more by chondroitin than placebo. Reduction in knee pain by 20% (as measured by the WOMAC 1  Pain subscale) ‐ 6 more people out of 100 experienced improvement of 20% in their knee pain (6% absolute difference). ‐ 53 people out of 100 who took chondroitin experienced improvement in their knee pain compared to 47 people out of 100 who took placebo. Lequesne’s index (a combination index of pain and physical function, indicating quality of life) after 6 months ‐ People who took chondroitin scored 2 points lower (better) on Lequesne's index (score range 0 to 24). ‐ People who took chondroitin scored 5 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index. ‐ People who took placebo scored 7 on a scale of 0 to 24 on Lequesne's index. Radiographic outcome: reduction in minimum joint space width (mm) (smaller decrease in reduction in minimum joint space width is better) after 2 years ‐ People who took chondroitin had 0.18 mm less reduction in minimum joint space width than those who took placebo. ‐ People who took chondroitin had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.12 mm. ‐ People who took placebo had a reduction in minimum joint space width of 0.30 mm. Serious adverse events ‐ 3 fewer of 100 people who took chondroitin experienced serious adverse events (such as a serious lung infection or tuberculosis). ‐ 3 of 100 people experienced a serious adverse event with chondroitin compared to 6 of 100 people who took placebo.    People who dropped out of the studies for adverse events ‐ People who took chondroitin had no difference in the risk of dropping out of the studies for adverse events than those who took a placebo.This may have happened by chance. 1 Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This review is an update of a previously published review, "Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis" (published in the Cochrane Library; 2010, Issue 12). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, axonal or neuronal loss, and astrocytic gliosis in the central nervous system (CNS), which can result in varying levels of disability. Some studies have provided evidence showing an association of MS with low levels of vitamin D and benefit derived from its supplementation. Objectives To evaluate the benefit and safety of vitamin D supplementation for reducing disease activity in people with MS. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS Specialized Register up to 2 October 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist with search terms relevant to this review. We included references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and from handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books from conferences. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared vitamin D versus placebo, routine care, or low doses of vitamin D in patients with MS. Vitamin D was administered as monotherapy or in combination with calcium. Concomitant interventions were allowed if they were used equally in all trial intervention groups. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of studies, while another review author sorted any disagreements. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes (Expanded Disability Status Scale and number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions), as standardised MDs for health‐related quality of life, as rate differences for annualised relapse rates, and as risk differences (RDs) for serious adverse events and minor adverse events, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified 12 RCTs enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group. Eleven trials tested vitamin D₃, and one trial tested vitamin D₂. Vitamin D₃ had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow‐up (rate difference ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.17 to 0.07; I² = 38%; five trials; 417 participants; very low‐quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument); on the Expanded Disability Status Scale at 52 weeks' follow‐up (MD ‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.61 to 0.10; I² = 35%; five trials; 221 participants; very low‐quality evidence according to GRADE); and on MRI gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions at 52 weeks' follow‐up (MD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.48; I² = 12%; two trials; 256 participants; very low‐quality evidence according to GRADE). Vitamin D₃ did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects within a range of 26 to 52 weeks' follow‐up (RD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.04; I² = 35%; eight trials; 621 participants; low‐quality evidence according to GRADE) or minor adverse effects within a range of 26 to 96 weeks' follow‐up (RD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.06; I² = 20%; eight trials; 701 participants; low‐quality evidence according to GRADE). Three studies reported health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) using different HRQOL scales. One study reported that vitamin D improved ratings on the psychological and social components of the HRQOL scale but had no effects on the physical components. The other two studies found no effect of vitamin D on HRQOL. Two studies reported fatigue using different scales. One study (158 participants) reported that vitamin D₃ reduced fatigue compared with placebo at 26 weeks' follow‐up. The other study (71 participants) found no effect on fatigue at 96 weeks' follow‐up. Seven studies reported on cytokine levels, four on T‐lymphocyte proliferation, and one on matrix metalloproteinase levels, with no consistent pattern of change in these immunological outcomes. The randomised trials included in this review provided no data on time to first treated relapse, number of participants requiring hospitalisation owing to progression of the disease, proportion of participants who remained relapse‐free, cognitive function, or psychological symptoms. Authors' conclusions To date, very low‐quality evidence suggests no benefit of vitamin D for patient‐important outcomes among people with MS. Vitamin D appears to have no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and MRI lesions. Effects on health‐related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Vitamin D₃ at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven ongoing studies will likely provide further evidence that can be included in a future update of this review. Plain language summary Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis Review question   Does vitamin D supplementation reduce disease activity in people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? What is the issue?   Several epidemiological, immunological, and genetic studies have reported an association between low vitamin D, measured as low blood 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels, and MS before and after the disease is triggered. Hence people with MS are screened for vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D preparations are given along with immunomodulatory therapy. Whether vitamin D supplementation improves relevant clinical outcomes (recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability) or decreases the number of lesions observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not clear. What did we do?   We evaluated the benefits and harms of vitamin D in people with MS. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo, routine care, or low doses of vitamin D. What did we find?   Our systematic search identified 12 studies enrolling 933 people with MS. Research shows that vitamin D has no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or new MRI gadolinium‐enhancing T1 lesions. Its effects on health‐related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Our confidence in these results is very low because vitamin D has been evaluated in only a few small trials that we judged as having high risk of bias. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe for people with MS included in our review, but available data are limited. Conclusions   For people with MS, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no effect on relevant clinical outcomes or new MRI lesions. Vitamin D supplementation at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven trials are ongoing; they will likely provide further evidence for a future update of this review. Currentness of evidence   This evidence is up‐to‐date as of October 2017.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with the potential to metastasise to other parts of the body via the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. Melanoma accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Various imaging tests can be used with the aim of detecting metastatic spread of disease following a primary diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) or on clinical suspicion of disease recurrence (re‐staging). Accurate staging is crucial to ensuring that patients are directed to the most appropriate and effective treatment at different points on the clinical pathway. Establishing the comparative accuracy of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)‐CT imaging for detection of nodal or distant metastases, or both, is critical to understanding if, how, and where on the pathway these tests might be used. Objectives Primary objectives We estimated accuracy separately according to the point in the clinical pathway at which imaging tests were used. Our objectives were: • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound or PET‐CT for detection of  nodal metastases  before sentinel lymph node biopsy in adults with confirmed cutaneous invasive melanoma; and • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for whole body imaging in adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma: ○ for detection of  any metastasis in adults with a primary diagnosis  of melanoma (i.e. primary staging at presentation); and ○ for detection of  any metastasis in adults undergoing staging of recurrence  of melanoma (i.e. re‐staging prompted by findings on routine follow‐up). We undertook separate analyses according to whether accuracy data were reported per patient or per lesion. Secondary objectives We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for whole body imaging (detection of any metastasis) in mixed or not clearly described populations of adults with cutaneous invasive melanoma. For study participants undergoing primary staging or re‐staging (for possible recurrence), and for mixed or unclear populations, our objectives were: • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of nodal metastases; • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of distant metastases; and • to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for detection of distant metastases according to metastatic site. Search methods We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists as well as published systematic review articles. Selection criteria We included studies of any design that evaluated ultrasound (with or without the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)), CT, MRI, or PET‐CT for staging of cutaneous melanoma in adults, compared with a reference standard of histological confirmation or imaging with clinical follow‐up of at least three months' duration. We excluded studies reporting multiple applications of the same test in more than 10% of study participants. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS‐2)). We estimated accuracy using the bivariate hierarchical method to produce summary sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence and prediction regions. We undertook analysis of studies allowing direct and indirect comparison between tests. We examined heterogeneity between studies by visually inspecting the forest plots of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Numbers of identified studies were insufficient to allow formal investigation of potential sources of heterogeneity. Main results We included a total of 39 publications reporting on 5204 study participants; 34 studies reporting data per patient included 4980 study participants with 1265 cases of metastatic disease, and seven studies reporting data per lesion included 417 study participants with 1846 potentially metastatic lesions, 1061 of which were confirmed metastases. The risk of bias was low or unclear for all domains apart from participant flow. Concerns regarding applicability of the evidence were high or unclear for almost all domains. Participant selection from mixed or not clearly defined populations and poorly described application and interpretation of index tests were particularly problematic. The accuracy of imaging for detection of regional nodal metastases before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was evaluated in 18 studies. In 11 studies (2614 participants; 542 cases), the summary sensitivity of ultrasound alone was 35.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0% to 59.4%) and specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 86.1% to 97.5%). Combining pre‐SLNB ultrasound with FNAC revealed summary sensitivity of 18.0% (95% CI 3.58% to 56.5%) and specificity of 99.8% (95% CI 99.1% to 99.9%) (1164 participants; 259 cases). Four studies demonstrated lower sensitivity (10.2%, 95% CI 4.31% to 22.3%) and specificity (96.5%,95% CI 87.1% to 99.1%) for PET‐CT before SLNB (170 participants, 49 cases). When these data are translated to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people eligible for SLNB, 237 of whom have nodal metastases (median prevalence), the combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with nodal metastases to be triaged directly to adjuvant therapy rather than having SLNB first, at a cost of two people with false positive results (who are incorrectly managed). Those with a false negative ultrasound will be identified on subsequent SLNB. Limited test accuracy data were available for whole body imaging via PET‐CT for primary staging or re‐staging for disease recurrence, and none evaluated MRI. Twenty‐four studies evaluated whole body imaging. Six of these studies explored primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma (492 participants), three evaluated re‐staging of disease following some clinical indication of recurrence (589 participants), and 15 included mixed or not clearly described population groups comprising participants at a number of different points on the clinical pathway and at varying stages of disease (1265 participants). Results for whole body imaging could not be translated to a hypothetical cohort of people due to paucity of data. Most of the studies (6/9) of primary disease or re‐staging of disease considered PET‐CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. No eligible evaluations of MRI in these groups were identified. All studies used histological reference standards combined with follow‐up, and two included FNAC for some participants. Observed accuracy for detection of any metastases for PET‐CT was higher for re‐staging of disease (summary sensitivity from two studies: 92.6%, 95% CI 85.3% to 96.4%; specificity: 89.7%, 95% CI 78.8% to 95.3%; 153 participants; 95 cases) compared to primary staging (sensitivities from individual studies ranged from 30% to 47% and specificities from 73% to 88%), and was more sensitive than CT alone in both population groups, but participant numbers were very small. No conclusions can be drawn regarding routine imaging of the brain via MRI or CT. Authors' conclusions Review authors found a disappointing lack of evidence on the accuracy of imaging in people with a diagnosis of melanoma at different points on the clinical pathway. Studies were small and often reported data according to the number of lesions rather than the number of study participants. Imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before SLNB may identify around one‐fifth of those with nodal disease, but confidence intervals are wide and further work is needed to establish cost‐effectiveness. Much of the evidence for whole body imaging for primary staging or re‐staging of disease is focused on PET‐CT, and comparative data with CT or MRI are lacking. Future studies should go beyond diagnostic accuracy and consider the effects of different imaging tests on disease management. The increasing availability of adjuvant therapies for people with melanoma at high risk of disease spread at presentation will have a considerable impact on imaging services, yet evidence for the relative diagnostic accuracy of available tests is limited. Plain language summary How good are ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT for identifying spread of disease in the body among people with melanoma? What is the aim of the review? We wanted to find out which imaging tests are better for identifying spread of disease among people with a first diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) and among people with possible recurrence of melanoma (re‐staging). We looked at the evidence for ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET‐CT and included 39 studies to answer these questions. Why are imaging tests for melanoma important? Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, with potential for metastases (cancer cells) to spread to the lymph nodes and other organs of the body. To make sure that people with melanoma receive the most appropriate and effective treatment, it is important to identify whether the disease has spread and to which parts of the body it has spread. This is called 'staging of disease'. Staging is done to find out if a melanoma has spread to regional lymph nodes or to lymph nodes close to the original melanoma, and to determine if the melanoma has spread to lymph nodes in other parts of the body or to organs of the body such as the liver or the brain (distant metastases). Imaging tests are tools that can be used to help find out how much the disease has spread. Several new treatments are now available for reducing the risk of spread of melanoma and for treating melanoma when it has spread. What was studied in the review? The review includes four imaging tests that create images of the body in different ways. Ultrasound uses high‐frequency sound waves to create images, CT scans use ionising radiation in the form of X‐rays (a very low dose of radiation), and MRI uses large magnets and non‐ionising radiation in the form of radio waves (which are not harmful) to generate images of the body. PET‐CT requires injection of a weakly radioactive substance (FDG). The PET part of the scan identifies areas of the body that take up a lot of FDG (indicating possibly cancerous cells), and the CT part of the scan helps to improve image quality and to more accurately pinpoint areas using more FDG. Ultrasound can also be performed along with a fairly simple procedure called 'fine needle aspiration cytology' (FNAC), by which a very fine needle is used to take a small sample of cells from a lymph node that looks suspicious on ultrasound. A microscope is then used to identify whether or not the cells are malignant. Imaging can be used at different time points after diagnosis of melanoma. Healthcare providers can use imaging to look at the regional lymph nodes closest to the melanoma before a type of surgery called sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed. Sentinel lymph node biopsy takes out the lymph nodes that are most likely to have metastases inside them so they can be tested in a laboratory. Imaging can also be used after sentinel lymph node biopsy or in people with higher‐risk melanoma to look for any spread of disease. Imaging can be used in people who were treated for melanoma at an earlier point and who might be having a recurrence of their disease. What are the main results of the review? Ultrasound of regional lymph nodes before sentinel lymph node biopsy We found 11 relevant studies including 2614 people. Three of these studies compared ultrasound on its own to ultrasound combined with FNAC. Results suggest that the combined procedure correctly identifies around one‐fifth of people with metastases in the lymph nodes with very few false positive results (people with incorrect diagnosis of metastasis). These results can be illustrated by imagining a group of 1000 people with melanoma who are going to have sentinel lymph node biopsy, of whom 237 (24%) have metastases in the lymph nodes. The combination of ultrasound with FNAC potentially allows 43 people with lymph node metastases to be identified and avoid a sentinel lymph node biopsy, at a cost of two people with false positive results who might go on to have the wrong treatment. Those with metastases in the lymph nodes that are missed on ultrasound (false negatives) will be identified on subsequent SLNB. Whole body imaging (detection of any metastases) We found 24 studies, but only nine were clear about the point in the time course of disease that imaging was carried out. Six studies including 492 people looked at imaging for primary staging following a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma, and three studies in 589 people evaluated re‐staging of disease in people with possible recurrence of disease. Most of the studies (6/9) considered PET‐CT, two in comparison to CT alone, and three studies examined the use of ultrasound. We did not find any suitable studies of MRI in these groups. Overall results suggest that PET‐CT is better for correctly identifying people with metastatic spread of disease who might be having a recurrence of disease (re‐staging) than people who have a new diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging). PET‐CT also seems to be better than CT for identifying spread of disease in both groups of people, but studies were very small and results might not be reliable. How reliable are the results of the studies included in this review? In most of our studies, a reliable diagnosis of spread of disease (or reference standard) was made by performing biopsy and by following up with people over time using clinical assessment and imaging. There was often a lack of detail on how patients were followed up and which tests were used. Lots of studies did not include people at clearly defined time points in the disease process, making it difficult to assess the relevance of their results. Reporting of application and interpretation of tests was poor. To whom do the results of this review apply? Thirty‐three studies were done in Europe (85%), and the rest in North America (n = 4), Asia (n = 1), or Oceania (n = 1). The average age of people in the studies was between 50 and 67 years, and around half were men. Studies mostly included people with melanoma on any part of the body, but two included only people with melanoma on the head or neck. Studies often included people at different stages of disease, and we were not able to look at the accuracy of tests for people at any particular disease stage. Studies were small, and their results might not match what happens in real life. What are the implications of this review? Reviewers found some evidence to support the use of imaging with ultrasound combined with FNAC before sentinel lymph node biopsy, but further work is needed to establish cost‐effectiveness. Limited evidence is available for whole body imaging for primary staging or re‐staging of disease. Available evidence is focused on PET‐CT; there are few comparisons with CT and no comparisons with MRI. Future research needs to look at more than test accuracy and must consider the effects of different imaging tests on treatment decisions for patients. How up‐to‐date is this review? The reviewers searched for and included studies published up to August 2016.* *In these studies, biopsy and clinical or imaging follow‐up were the reference standards (methods of establishing the final diagnosis).},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Chronic limb‐threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that includes chronic ischaemic rest pain or ischaemic skin lesions, ulcers, or gangrene for longer than two weeks. The severity of the disease depends on the extent of arterial stenosis and the availability of collateral circulation. Treatment for CLTI aims to relieve ischaemic pain, heal ischaemic ulcers, prevent limb loss, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. CLTI due to occlusive disease in the infrapopliteal arterial circulation (below‐knee circulation) can be treated via an endovascular technique by a balloon opening the narrowed vessel, so called angioplasty, with or without the additional deployment of a scaffold made of metal alloy or other material, so called stenting. Endovascular interventions in the infrapopliteal vasculature may improve symptoms in patients with CLTI by re‐establishing in‐line blood flow to the foot. Controversy remains as to whether a balloon should be used alone to open the vessel, or whether a stent should also be deployed. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone versus PTA with stenting of infrapopliteal arterial lesions (anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, fibular artery (formerly known as peroneal artery), and common tibioperoneal trunk) for patients with chronic limb‐threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, as well as World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 25 June 2018. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We planned to include randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing PTA versus PTA with a stent and including patients aged 18 years or over with CLTI. We defined CLTI as Fontaine stage III (ischaemic rest pain) and IV (ischaemic ulcers or gangrene) or consistent with Rutherford category 4 (ischaemic rest pain), 5 (minor tissue loss), and 6 (major tissue loss), with stenotic (> 50% luminal loss) or occluded infrapopliteal artery, including tibiofibular trunk, anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery, and fibular artery. We included all types of stents irrespective of design (e.g. bare‐metal, drug‐eluting, bio‐absorbable). Data collection and analysis Two review authors (CC‐TH and GNCK) independently selected suitable trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. An additional third review author (MLvD) assessed trial quality and, when necessary, acted as arbiter for study selection and data extraction. Outcomes included technical success of the procedure, procedural complications, patency, major amputation, and mortality. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We included in the review seven trials with 542 participants. One trial randomised limbs to undergo PTA alone or PTA with stent placement, and the remaining studies randomised participants. Five trials with 476 participants show that the technical success rate was greater in the stent group than in the angioplasty group (odds ratio (OR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 7.93; 476 lesions; 5 studies; I² = 23%). Meta‐analysis of three eligible trials with 456 participants did not show a clear difference in short‐term (within six months) patency between infrapopliteal arterial lesions treated with PTA and those treated with PTA and stenting (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11; 456 lesions; 3 studies; I² = 77%). Results also did not show clear differences between treatment groups in procedure complication rate (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.01 to 53.60; 360 participants; 5 studies; I² = 85%), rate of major amputations at 12 months (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.22; 306 participants; 4 studies; I² = 0%), and rate of mortality at 12 months (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.17; 497 participants; 6 studies; I² = 0%). Heterogeneity between studies was high for the outcomes procedure complications and primary patency. The overall methodological quality of the trials included in this review was moderate due to selection and performance bias. Studies used different regimens for pretreatment and post‐treatment antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. We downgraded the certainty of the overall evidence for all outcomes by one level to moderate due to inconsistency of results across studies and large confidence intervals (small numbers of trials and participants). Authors' conclusions Trials show that the immediate technical success rate of restoring luminal patency is higher in the stent group but reveal no clear differences in short‐term patency at six months between infrapopliteal arterial lesions treated with PTA with stenting versus those treated with PTA without stenting. We ascertained no clear differences between groups in periprocedural complications, major amputation, and mortality. However, use of different regimens for pretreatment and post‐treatment antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication and the duration of its use within and between trials may have influenced the outcomes. Limited currently available data suggest that high‐quality evidence is insufficient to show that PTA with stent insertion is superior to use of standard PTA alone without stenting for treatment of infrapopliteal arterial lesions. Further studies should standardise the use of antiplatelets/anticoagulants before and after the intervention to improve the comparability of the two treatments. Plain language summary Angioplasty versus stenting for below‐knee arterial disease in people with chronic limb‐threatening ischaemia Background Chronic limb‐threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease that occurs as chronic ischaemic rest pain or ischaemic skin lesions, ulcers, or gangrene with symptoms present for longer than two weeks. The symptoms are a result of impaired blood flow to the leg and the foot due to narrowing of the arteries by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque composed of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in the blood; over time, the plaque narrows the artery. Patients can have narrowing of the artery in the thigh or below the knee. This review focusses on a subgroup of patients with below‐knee arterial disease (infrapopliteal arterial disease) who might benefit from an intervention that re‐establishes blood flow by inserting and inflating a balloon to re‐open the narrowed artery (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). This can be performed with or without additional placement of a stent (a scaffold made of metal alloy or other material). The types of stents used in this procedure vary from a simple bare‐metal stent to a stent coated with medication. However, it is not clear whether deploying stents after ballooning in narrowed below‐knee arteries (infrapopliteal arteries) provides any additional benefit for the patient. Study characteristics and key results We identified seven trials with a combined total of 542 participants comparing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone versus PTA with stent placement (current until June 2018). One trial randomised limbs to PTA alone or PTA with stent placement, and the remaining studies randomised participants. Full analysis of five trials shows that the technical success rate of re‐opening the narrowed artery was higher in the stent group than in the PTA group. However, we noted no clear differences in patency (opened vessel remaining open) of the treated vessel at six months. The complication rate of the procedure, the number of major amputations at 12 months, and the number of deaths at 12 months also did not differ greatly between treatment groups. Certainty of the evidence The overall certainty of evidence provided by the trials included in this review was moderate. Trials differed in their methods. Two studies reported poorly on the methods used to generate random numbers and to allocate participants to different groups. All studies were unblinded. All included studies were rated as direct in their relevance to the review question. Overall, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes by one level to moderate due to inconsistency of results across studies and the small numbers of studies and participants. Conclusion PTA with stent placement is better than PTA alone for restoring vessel patency immediately; however we found no clear difference in short‐term patency at six months between the two groups. Trials show no clear differences between groups in complications at or around the time of the procedure, major amputation, and death. Currently available data suggest that high‐certainty evidence is insufficient to show that PTA with stent placement is superior to PTA alone for treatment of infrapopliteal arterial lesions. Further studies should standardise the use of blood‐thinning drugs (antiplatelets/anticoagulants) before and after both interventions to improve the comparability of the two treatments.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Morphea (morphoea) is an immune‐mediated disease in which excess synthesis and deposition of collagen in the skin and underlying connective tissues results in hardened cutaneous areas. Morphea has different clinical features according to the subtype and stage of evolution of the disease. There is currently no consensus on optimal interventions for morphea. Objectives To assess the effects of treatments for people with any form of morphea. Search methods We searched the following databases up to July 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and five trial registers. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of topical, intralesional, or systemic treatments (isolated or combined) in anyone who has been clinically diagnosed by a medical practitioner with any form of morphea. Eligible controls were placebo, no intervention, any other treatment, or different doses or duration of a treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were global improvement of disease activity or damage assessed by a medical practitioner or by participants, and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were improvement of disease activity and improvement of disease damage. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. Main results We included 14 trials, with a total of 429 randomised participants, aged between 3 and 76 years. There were juvenile and adult participants; over half were female, and the majority had circumscribed morphea, followed by linear scleroderma. The settings of the studies (where described) included a dermatologic centre, a national laboratory centre, paediatric rheumatology and dermatology centres, and a university hospital or medical centre. The studies evaluated heterogenous therapies for different types of morphea, covering a wide range of comparisons. We were unable to conduct any meta‐analyses. Seven studies investigated topical medications, two evaluated intralesional medications, and five investigated systemic medications. The study duration ranged from seven weeks to 15 months from baseline. We present here results for our primary outcomes for our four key comparisons. All of these results are based on low‐quality evidence. The included studies were at high risk of performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias. Global improvement of disease activity or damage after treatment may be higher with oral methotrexate (15 mg/m², maximum 20 mg, once a week, for 12 months or until disease flare) plus oral prednisone (1 mg/kg a day, maximum of 50 mg, in a single morning dose, for three months, and one month with gradually decreased dose until discontinuation) than with placebo plus oral prednisone in children and adolescents with active morphea (linear scleroderma, generalised morphea or mixed morphea: linear and circumscribed) (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 4.45; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT); 70 participants, all juvenile). This outcome was measured 12 months from the start of treatment or until flare of the disease. Data were not available separately for each morphea type. There may be little or no difference in the number of participants experiencing at least one adverse event with oral methotrexate (26/46) or placebo (11/24) (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.04; 1 RCT; 70 participants assessed during the 12‐month follow‐up). Adverse events related to methotrexate included alopecia, nausea, headache, fatigue and hepatotoxicity, whilst adverse events related to prednisone (given in both groups) included weight gain (more than 5% of body weight) and striae rubrae. One three‐armed RCT compared the following treatments: medium‐dose (50 J/cm²) UVA‐1; low‐dose (20 J/cm²) UVA‐1; and narrowband UVB phototherapy. There may be little or no difference between treatments in global improvement of disease activity or damage, as assessed through the modified skin score (where high values represent a worse outcome): medium‐dose UVA‐1 phototherapy versus low‐dose UVA‐1 group: MD 1.60, 95% CI −1.70 to 4.90 (44 participants); narrowband UVB phototherapy versus medium‐dose UVA‐1 group: MD −1.70, 95% CI −5.27 to 1.87 (35 participants); and narrowband UVB versus low‐dose UVA‐1 group: MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.49 to 2.29 (45 participants). This RCT included children and adults with active morphea (circumscribed morphea, linear scleroderma (with trunk/limb variant and head variant), generalised morphea, or mixed morphea), who received phototherapy five times a week, for eight weeks. Outcomes were measured at eight weeks from the start of treatment. Safety data, measured throughout treatment, from the same RCT (62 participants) showed that treatment with UVA‐1 phototherapy may cause mild tanning compared to narrowband UVB: narrowband UVB versus medium‐dose UVA‐1: RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42; 35 participants; narrowband UVB versus low‐dose UVA‐1: RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41; 45 participants. However, there may be no difference in the number of participants reporting mild tanning when comparing medium and low dose UVA‐1 phototherapy (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 44 participants). Transient erythema was reported in three participants with narrowband UVB and no participants in the low‐ or medium‐dose UVA‐1 groups. Authors' conclusions Compared to placebo plus oral prednisone, oral methotrexate plus oral prednisone may improve disease activity or damage in juvenile active morphea (linear scleroderma, generalised morphea or mixed morphea: linear and circumscribed), but there may be a slightly increased chance of experiencing at least one adverse event. When medium‐dose UVA‐1 (50 J/cm²), low‐dose UVA‐1 (20 J/cm²), and narrowband UVB were compared against each other in treating children and adults with active morphea (circumscribed morphea, linear scleroderma, generalised morphea and mixed morphea), there may be little or no difference between these treatments on global improvement of disease activity or damage. UVA‐1 phototherapy may cause more mild tanning than narrowband UVB, but there may be no difference between medium‐ and low‐dose UVA‐1 phototherapy. These results are based on low‐quality evidence. Limitations of data and analyses include risk of bias and imprecision (small number of participants or events and wide confidence intervals). We encourage multicentre RCTs to increase sample size and evaluate, with validated tools, different treatment responses according to the subtypes of morphea and age groups. Plain language summary Interventions for morphea Review question The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of treatments, either given in isolation or combination, for people with morphea (morphoea), when compared with an inactive substance (placebo), no intervention, any other treatment, or different doses or duration of a treatment. We collected and analysed all relevant studies published up to July 2018. Background Morphea is a rare disease that causes skin hardening. It affects adults and children equally, and is more common in females. There are different subtypes of morphea, with different characteristics: circumscribed morphea is generally less severe than the other subtypes; linear scleroderma can cause significant body differences, possibly affecting growth in children; generalised morphea is a severe type involving multiple areas of the body; pansclerotic morphea is a severe and progressive type of generalised morphea; and mixed morphea is the presence of two or more disease types. Recurrence rates are high, and even when disease activity reduces, a person can be left with permanent effects. This review intended to assess the safety and effectiveness of different treatments for morphea. Study characteristics We found 14 relevant studies, with a total of 429 participants, including children and adults aged from three to 76 years. Over half of the participants were female. Most participants had circumscribed morphea, followed by linear scleroderma. Six studies did not describe their setting, but the rest were set in university hospital, medical centre, or national laboratory centre. Seven studies received funding from either universities, government or association scholarships, or the pharmaceutical industry. Six studies had no funding, and one study did not report this information. Seven studies compared topical medications: phototherapy; an immunosuppressive (suppresses immune system activity); an antiallergic drug; and a corticosteroid (an anti‐inflammatory). Two studies compared medications within the lesion itself: collagen, and an immunomodulator (modifies the immune response). Five studies compared systemic medications (meaning they affect the whole body): an immunosuppressive; traditional Chinese medicine therapies; and a vitamin D analogue (a form of vitamin D). These treatments were compared with either no treatment; placebo; differing doses of phototherapy; hydroxychloroquine (an immune system regulator); emollient petrolatum (moisturising treatment); corticosteroids; an anticoagulant agent (blood thinner) taken with a medicinal plant extract and vitamin E tablet; or antibiotic with base cream. The studies lasted between seven weeks and 15 months. Key results The results we present in this summary are based on low‐quality evidence. Children and teenagers with active morphea (linear scleroderma, generalised morphea and mixed morphea: linear and circumscribed) may experience greater improvement of disease activity or damage with oral methotrexate plus prednisone than with placebo plus prednisone. We would expect that out of 100 children and teenagers, 67 would experience improvement with methotrexate, compared with 29 given placebo; this is based on results measured either 12 months after start of treatment or until flare of the disease. In addition, there may be little or no difference in the number of participants experiencing at least one side effect during treatment (such as hair loss, headache, sickness, tiredness, or liver damage) between those given methotrexate and those given placebo. Side effects from prednisone (given in both groups) included weight gain and stretch marks. We would expect that out of 100 children and teenagers, 56 would experience at least one side effect with methotrexate, compared with 46 given placebo. Children and adults with active morphea (circumscribed morphea, linear scleroderma, generalised morphea, or mixed morphea) may present similar reduction in disease activity or damage with medium‐dose (50 J/cm²) UVA‐1, low‐dose (20 J/cm²) UVA‐1, or narrowband UVB phototherapy. Those treated with medium‐dose (50 J/cm²) UVA‐1 or low‐dose (20 J/cm²) UVA‐1 phototherapy may have mild tanning after the treatment compared to those treated with narrowband UVB phototherapy. However, there may be no difference in the number of participants reporting mild tanning when comparing medium‐ and low‐dose UVA‐1 phototherapy. Temporary redness was reported in three participants given narrowband UVB and none of the participants in either the low‐ or medium‐dose UVA‐1 groups. Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of evidence as low because most studies included few participants and there were concerns over the design of some studies, such as no treatment masking and incomplete analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in concerning side effects. Objectives To assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Search methods MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants were searched. The MEDLINE and CCTR searches were updated in March 2007. Selection criteria Trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long‐term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams were selected. The intervention was allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment or another type, dose or route of administration of vitamin E. Data collection and analysis The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. Main results Twenty‐six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long‐term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount. Vitamin E significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage and increased the risk of sepsis; however, heterogeneity limits the strength of these latter two inferences. Vitamin E did not significantly affect other morbidity or mortality. In VLBW infants, vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined.   Subgroup analyses demonstrated (1) an association between intravenous, high‐dose vitamin E supplementation and increased risk of sepsis and of parenchymal cerebral hemorrhage; (2) an association between vitamin E supplementation by other than the intravenous route and reduced risk of germinal matrix‐intraventricular hemorrhage and of severe intraventricular hemorrhage; and (3) an association between serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl and increased risk of sepsis and reduced risk for severe retinopathy among those examined. Authors' conclusions Vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intracranial hemorrhage but increased the risk of sepsis. In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. Evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplementation by intravenous route at high doses or aiming at serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl. Plain language summary Vitamin E supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants Giving extra vitamin E to preterm babies can provide some benefits, but it increases the risk of life‐threatening infections. Preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) can develop a range of problems because their organs are not mature. Vitamin E may be able to help prevent or limit some of these problems, but it can potentially also have harmful effects. Breast milk of a woman who has given birth prematurely has higher than usual levels of vitamin E. Preterm babies can be given extra vitamin E as vitamin drops, in vitamin E‐enriched formula, in intravenous fluids, or by injection into their muscles. This review of studies of vitamin E supplements found that while extra vitamin E reduces the chances of some complications (including disease of the retina), the risk of life‐threatening infection is increased. The risk of bleeding in the brain is increased when extra vitamin E is given by vein but decreased when the extra vitamin E is given by other routes.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Vitamin D is a micronutrient important for bone growth and immune function. Deficiency can lead to rickets and has been linked to various infections, including respiratory infections. The evidence on the effects of supplementation on infections in children has not been assessed systematically. Objectives To evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, and malaria in children under five years of age. This includes high‐, middle‐, and low‐income countries. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP;  http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/ ) , ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN registry (http://www.isrctn.com/) up to 16 June 2016. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated preventive supplementation of vitamin D (versus placebo or no intervention) in children under five years of age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias of included trials. Main results Four trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 3198 children under five years of age, and were conducted in Afghanistan, Spain, and the USA. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varied widely in these populations (range: 73.1% in Afghanistan, 10 to 12% in USA, and 6.2% in Spain). The included trials evaluated mortality (two trials), pneumonia incidence (two trials), diarrhoea incidence (two trials), hospitalization (two trials), and mean serum vitamin D concentrations (four trials). We do not know whether vitamin D supplementation impacts on all‐cause mortality because this outcome was underpowered due to few events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 3.74; one trial, 3046 participants,  low quality evidence ). For pneumonia, episodes of 'radiologically confirmed' first or only episode of pneumonia were little different in the supplemented and unsupplemented group (Rate Ratio: 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.26; two trials, 3134 participants,  moderate quality evidence ), and similarly for children with confirmed or unconfirmed pneumonia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.04; one trial, 3046 participants). In these two trials there were no obvious differences between supplemented and unsupplemented children regarding episodes of diarrhoea. In the single large trial from Afghanistan, the trial authors reported that vitamin D supplementation was associated with an increase in repeat episodes of pneumonia confirmed by chest radiograph (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.21; one trial, 3046 participants), but not reflected in the outcome of confirmed or unconfirmed pneumonia (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; one trial, 3046 participants). For hospital admission measured in one small trial, there was no difference detected (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.62; one trial, 88 participants;  very low quality evidence ). The mean serum vitamin D concentrations were higher in supplemented compared to unsupplemented children at the end of supplementation (MD 7.72 ng/mL, 95% CI 0.50 to 14.93; four trials, 266 participants,  low quality evidence ). These results were driven primarily by two smaller trials with large magnitudes of effect. In the other two bigger trials, serum vitamin D concentrations were elevated in the intervention group for most of the trial duration but not at the end of supplementation. This may be due to time elapsed at measurement from the last dose, incomplete compliance, or increased need of vitamin D with infant age. We did not find any trial that reported on the incidence of TB, malaria or febrile illness, duration of pneumonia, duration of diarrhoea, severity of infection, and cause‐specific mortality (due to TB, diarrhoea, or malaria). Authors' conclusions Evidence from one large trial did not demonstrate benefit of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of pneumonia or diarrhoea in children under five years. To our knowledge, trials that evaluated supplementation for preventing other infections, including TB and malaria, have not been performed. 23 April 2019 Update pending Studies awaiting assessment The CIDG is currently examining a search conducted up to April 2019 for potentially relevant studies. These studies have not yet been incorporated into this Cochrane Review. All eligible published studies found in the last search (16 Jun, 2016) were included and four ongoing studies were identified (see 'Characteristics of ongoing studies' section). Plain language summary Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections in children under five Background Vitamin D is a micronutrient important for bone growth and immune function. Deficiency can lead to rickets and has been linked to various infections, including respiratory infections. Several studies have reported an association between vitamin D deficiency and infections among children, and is thought to be related to the role of vitamin D in the immune system. In this systematic review, Cochrane researchers examined the role of vitamin D supplementation in prevention of infections in children under five years of age. The researchers studied the infections of pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), diarrhoea, and malaria in this review. Study characteristics The review authors examined the available evidence up to 17 June 2016, and included four trials with a total of 3198 children under five years of age. The included trials were conducted in Afghanistan, Spain and the USA. Key findings The review did not detect an effect of vitamin D supplementation on death ( low quality evidence ); the occurrence of the first or only episode of pneumonia; or on children with pneumonia, irrespective of whether this had been confirmed by hospital tests ( moderate quality evidence ). Limited evidence showed that there was no obvious difference in the first or repeat episodes of diarrhoea between supplemented and unsupplemented children. We do not know about whether Vitamin D influences hospital admissions as there was only one small study measuring this ( very low quality evidence ). The mean serum vitamin D concentrations were higher in the supplemented versus unsupplemented children at the end of supplementation period ( low quality evidence ). One large trial from Afghanistan showed an increase in repeat episodes of confirmed pneumonia but not on confirmed and unconfirmed pneumonia. None of the included trials reported on TB or malaria as outcomes. Conclusions One large trial has not demonstrated an effect of vitamin D on death or respiratory infections in children under five years of age. We did not find trials evaluating Vitamin D supplementation to prevent other infections such as TB and malaria.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This is an update of the review on 'Percutaneous transluminal rotational atherectomy for coronary artery disease' first published in  The Cochrane Library  Issue 4, 2003. Percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA) debulks atherosclerotic plaque from coronary arteries using an abrasive burr. On rotation, the burr selectively removes hard tissue. PTCRA has been used both as an alternative to and in conjunction with balloon angioplasty to open up blocked coronary arteries. Its ongoing effectiveness and safety compared with other modes of removing atherosclerotic plaques is reviewed.  Objectives To assess the effects of PTCRA for coronary artery disease in patients with non‐complex and complex lesions (e.g. ostial, long or diffuse lesions or those arising from in‐stent re‐stenosis) of the coronary arteries. Search methods For the original review, we searched the Heart Group Specialised Register;  The Cochrane Library  to Issue 2, 2001; and MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and Current Contents to December 2002 and reviewed reference lists for relevant articles. For the current review, we searched the same registries from 2002 to 2012 and reviewed reference lists for relevant articles.  Selection criteria We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials of PTCRA compared with placebo, no treatment or another intervention and excluded cross‐over trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies identified. Data were extracted independently by two review authors. We asked authors of trials to provide information when missing data were encountered. Statistical summaries used risk ratios (RR) and weighted mean differences. Main results We included 12 trials enrolling 3474 patients. The overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data; however, the authors determined that this would be unlikely to impact negatively as most data outcomes were objective (e.g. death vs. no death). There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non‐complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re‐stenosis rates at six months (RR 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.33) and at one year (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55) in those receiving PTCRA with adjunctive balloon angioplasty (PTCA) (PTCRA/PTCA) compared to those receiving PTCA alone. Morphological characteristics distinguishing complex lesions have not been examined in parallel‐arm randomised controlled trials. The evidence for the effectiveness of PTCRA in in‐stent re‐stenosis is unclear Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA did not result in a statistically significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction (MI), emergency cardiac surgery or death) during the in‐hospital period (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.90). Compared to angioplasty, PTCRA was associated with nine times the risk of an angiographically detectable vascular spasm (RR 9.23; 95% CI 4.61 to 18.47), four times the risk of perforation (RR 4.28; 95% CI 0.92 to 19.83) and about twice the risk of transient vessel occlusions (RR 2.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 4.99) while angiographic dissections (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.68) and stents used as a bailout procedure (RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.87) were less common. Authors' conclusions When conventional PTCA is feasible, PTCRA appears to confer no additional benefits. There is limited published evidence and no long‐term data to support the routine use of PTCRA in in‐stent re‐stenosis. Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA did not result in a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events, but patients were more likely to experience vascular spasm, perforation and transient vessel occlusion. In certain circumstances (e.g. patients ineligible for cardiac surgery, those with architecturally complex lesions, or those with lesions that fail PTCA), PTCRA may achieve satisfactory re‐vascularisation in subsequent procedures. Plain language summary Percutaneous transluminal rotational atherectomy for coronary artery disease Atherosclerosis is the build‐up of fat and other substances within blood vessels. Several methods are used to remove this build‐up including a procedure known as percutaneous transluminalcoronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA). PTCRA utilises small rotating devices to selectively remove the build‐up of atherosclerotic plaques from within coronary vessels. This review sought to determine whether PTCRA leads to improved patient outcomes compared to balloon angioplasty. It was important to do this review as it is not known whether or not PTCRA provides greater benefits to patients compared to balloon angioplasty.  The review analysed data from 12 studies, which showed that there is limited evidence to support the routine use of PTCRA for in‐stent re‐stenosis; however, only for those people who were not suitable for surgery. For those with complex lesions, PTCRA may provide some benefit in comparison to balloon angioplasty. The review also showed that patients receiving PTCRA were more likely to have perforations during the procedure compared to patients receiving balloon angioplasty. This review was limited by the small number of studies and deficiency of data reported in some of the studies. },

abstract = {Abstract - Background Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumour. They are graded using the WHO classification system, with Grade II‐IV astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. Low‐grade gliomas (LGGs) are WHO Grade II infiltrative brain tumours that typically appear solid and non‐enhancing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. People with LGG often have little or no neurologic deficit, so may opt for a watch‐and‐wait‐approach over surgical resection, radiotherapy or both, as surgery can result in early neurologic disability. Occasionally, high‐grade gliomas (HGGs, WHO Grade III and IV) may have the same MRI appearance as LGGs. Taking a watch‐and‐wait approach could be detrimental for the patient if the tumour progresses quickly. Advanced imaging techniques are increasingly used in clinical practice to predict the grade of the tumour and to aid clinical decision of when to intervene surgically. One such advanced imaging technique is magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion, which detects abnormal haemodynamic changes related to increased angiogenesis and vascular permeability, or "leakiness" that occur with aggressive tumour histology. These are reflected by changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) expressed as rCBV (ratio of tumoural CBV to normal appearing white matter CBV) and permeability, measured by  K trans . Objectives To determine the diagnostic test accuracy of MR perfusion for identifying patients with primary solid and non‐enhancing LGGs (WHO Grade II) at first presentation in children and adults. In performing the quantitative analysis for this review, patients with LGGs were considered disease positive while patients with HGGs were considered disease negative. To determine what clinical features and methodological features affect the accuracy of MR perfusion. Search methods Our search strategy used two concepts: (1) glioma and the various histologies of interest, and (2) MR perfusion. We used structured search strategies appropriate for each database searched, which included: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index). The most recent search for this review was run on 9 November 2016. We also identified 'grey literature' from online records of conference proceedings from the American College of Radiology, European Society of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology and European Society of Neuroradiology in the last 20 years. Selection criteria The titles and abstracts from the search results were screened to obtain full‐text articles for inclusion or exclusion. We contacted authors to clarify or obtain missing/unpublished data. We included cross‐sectional studies that performed dynamic susceptibility (DSC) or dynamic contrast‐enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion or both of untreated LGGs and HGGs, and where rCBV and/or  K trans  values were reported. We selected participants with solid and non‐enhancing gliomas who underwent MR perfusion within two months prior to histological confirmation. We excluded studies on participants who received radiation or chemotherapy before MR perfusion, or those without histologic confirmation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data, and assessed the methodological quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool. We present a summary of the study characteristics and QUADAS‐2 results, and rate studies as good quality when they have low risk of bias in the domains of reference standard of tissue diagnosis and flow and timing between MR perfusion and tissue diagnosis. In the quantitative analysis, LGGs were considered disease positive, while HGGs were disease negative. The sensitivity refers to the proportion of LGGs detected by MR perfusion, and specificity as the proportion of detected HGGs. We constructed two‐by‐two tables with true positives and false negatives as the number of correctly and incorrectly diagnosed LGG, respectively, while true negatives and false positives are the number of correctly and incorrectly diagnosed HGG, respectively. Meta‐analysis was performed on studies with two‐by‐two tables, with further sensitivity analysis using good quality studies. Limited data precluded regression analysis to explore heterogeneity but subgroup analysis was performed on tumour histology groups. Main results Seven studies with small sample sizes (4 to 48) met our inclusion criteria. These were mostly conducted in university hospitals and mostly recruited adult patients. All studies performed DSC MR perfusion and described heterogeneous acquisition and post‐processing methods. Only one study performed DCE MR perfusion, precluding quantitative analysis. Using patient‐level data allowed selection of individual participants relevant to the review, with generally low risks of bias for the participant selection, reference standard and flow and timing domains. Most studies did not use a pre‐specified threshold, which was considered a significant source of bias, however this did not affect quantitative analysis as we adopted a common rCBV threshold of 1.75 for the review. Concerns regarding applicability were low. From published and unpublished data, 115 participants were selected and included in the meta‐analysis. Average rCBV (range) of 83 LGGs and 32 HGGs were 1.29 (0.01 to 5.10) and 1.89 (0.30 to 6.51), respectively. Using the widely accepted rCBV threshold of  < 1.75 to differentiate LGG from HGG, the summary sensitivity/specificity estimates were 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.93)/0.48 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.90). Sensitivity analysis using five good quality studies yielded sensitivity/specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.91)/0.67 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.98). Subgroup analysis for tumour histology showed sensitivity/specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.99)/0.42 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.95) in astrocytomas (6 studies, 55 participants) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.93)/0.53 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.88) in oligodendrogliomas+oligoastrocytomas (6 studies, 56 participants). Data were too sparse to investigate any differences across subgroups. Authors' conclusions The limited available evidence precludes reliable estimation of the performance of DSC MR perfusion‐derived rCBV for the identification of grade in untreated solid and non‐enhancing LGG from that of HGG. Pooled data yielded a wide range of estimates for both sensitivity (range 66% to 93% for detection of LGGs) and specificity (range 9% to 90% for detection of HGGs). Other clinical and methodological features affecting accuracy of the technique could not be determined from the limited data. A larger sample size of both LGG and HGG, preferably using a standardised scanning approach and with an updated reference standard incorporating molecular profiles, is required for a definite conclusion. Plain language summary How accurate is MR perfusion, an advanced MRI method, for differentiating low‐grade gliomas from high‐grade gliomas in children and adults? Why is differentiation of low‐grade and high‐grade gliomas important? Low‐grade gliomas (LGGs) are slow growing brain tumours that have a typical appearance on standard MRI. Patients with LGGs who have few or no symptoms may prefer to delay treatment until such time they experience progression of their symptoms or appearance of the tumour on MRI; this is called the watch‐and‐wait approach. However occasionally, high‐grade gliomas (HGGs), which are aggressive and require early treatment, can mimic the appearance of LGGs. It is only by examining tissues obtained by surgery ‐ either through sampling (biopsy) or removal of tumour (resection) ‐ can LGG and HGG be definitively differentiated. But a patient with few or no symptoms may want to avoid risking early neurologic disability resulting from surgery. Thus an accurate noninvasive method to differentiate gliomas can aid patients' decision making whether to opt for a watch‐and‐wait approach or undergo early treatment. What is the aim of this review? The review aims to determine how accurate MR perfusion is for differentiating LGGs and HGGs, and what factors affect its accuracy. Researchers in Cochrane included seven studies to answer this question. What was studied in this review? An advanced MRI technique called MR perfusion was studied. This method detects abnormal blood vessels which are increased from low‐ to high‐grade gliomas. Unlike surgery, MR perfusion is noninvasive and allows clinicians to determine if a watch‐and‐wait approach can be adopted by patients, i.e. delay treatment including the initial tissue examination which requires surgery. What are the main results of the review? The analysis included results from 115 patients. The results indicate that in theory, if MR perfusion were to be used in 100 patients with brain tumours that look like LGG on standard MRI scan, of whom 72 actually have LGG, then:  ‐ an estimated 74 will have an MR perfusion result indicating that they have LGGs, and of these 15 will have HGGs;  ‐ an estimated 26 will have an MR perfusion result indicating that they have HGGs, and of these 13 will have LGGs. How reliable are the results of the studies in this review? In the included studies, the diagnosis of LGG or HGG was made by assessing all patients with tissue examination, and a majority underwent resection. This is considered a reliable method for deciding whether patients actually had LGGs or HGGs. The small number of patients that were included in this review is a major limitation to the analysis. Estimates from individual studies and pooled data were variable and/or had a wide range. The numbers reported in the main results above are an average across studies in the review, but it is unknown if MR perfusion will always produce these results. Further, the included studies differed in how MR perfusion was performed, and pooling of data for the analysis may be inappropriate. Who do the results of this review apply to? The included studies were carried out in Europe (Italy, Sweden, Spain, France), Asia (Japan) and South America (Brazil) and MR perfusion was mostly performed in university hospitals. Most studies recruited adults so the results may not be representative of children. What are the implications of this review? Our results based on 115 patients showed that MR perfusion may detect 66% to 93% of LGGs, which means that 7% to 34% of people with LGGs may be misclassified as having HGGs and thus may undergo early invasive treatment with an accompanying risk of adverse events. Meanwhile, around half of people with HGGs may be misclassified as having LGGs, and thus may suffer from delayed treatment. Due to uncertainty in the estimates this may range from 9% to 90% of patients. Given the wide range of estimates, currently, it cannot be determined how accurate MR perfusion is for differentiating LGGs and HGGs. Future studies to inform evidence would need to include larger numbers of patients with LGG and HGG. How up to date is this review? We searched for and used studies published from 1990 to November 2016.},
