TI  - Vascular Calcification Markers and Hemodialysis Vascular Access Complications.
PG  - 330-338
LID - 10.1159/000493549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous (AV) access dysfunction is a common complication in 
      hemodialysis patients. Markers of vascular calcification are associated with 
      cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in this population, but their association with 
      vascular access outcomes is unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
      association between selected vascular calcification makers and vascular access 
      complications in a cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHOD: Fetuin-A, osteopontin 
      (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) were measured 
      in blood samples from 219 dialysis patients in the Choice for Healthy Outcomes in 
      Caring for end-stage renal disease study; these patients were using a permanent 
      vascular access. Participants were followed for up to 1 year or until the occurrence 
      of a vascular access intervention or replacement. Associations with AV fistula (AVF) 
      and AV graft (AVG) intervention-free survival were assessed in models adjusted for 
      demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and inflammation. RESULTS: A total of 24 
      out 103 participants with an AVF and 43 out of 116 participants with an AVG had an 
      intervention during follow-up. Lower fetuin-A, higher OPN, and higher BMP-7 were 
      associated with a higher risk of AVF intervention (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] for 
      highest versus lowest tertile = 0.30 [95% CI 0.10-0.94]) for fetuin-A, 3.84 (95% CI 
      1.16-12.74) for OPN, and 3.49 (95% CI 1.16-10.52) for BMP-7. OPG was not 
      significantly associated with the risk of AVF intervention. The associations of OPN 
      and BMP-7 with AVF intervention appeared stronger among participants without 
      diabetes (aHR 8.06; 95% CI 1.11-58.57 for OPN and aHR 2.55; 95% CI 1.08-6.08 for 
      BMP-7, respectively) than among their counterparts with diabetes (p interaction = 
      0.06). None of the markers studied were significantly associated with AVG 
      interventions. CONCLUSION: Lower fetuin-A and higher OPN and BMP-7 are associated 
      with complications in AVF but not in AVG, suggesting a role for calcification in the 
      pathogenesis AVF failure.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among 
      Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.0363 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in 
      dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are sparse 
      data on the association of CAC with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease and 
      all-cause mortality in this population. OBJECTIVE: To study the prospective 
      association of CAC with risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among 
      dialysis-naive patients with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective 
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study recruited adults with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 7 clinical centers in the 
      United States. There were 1541 participants without cardiovascular disease at 
      baseline who had CAC scores. EXPOSURES: Coronary artery calcification was assessed 
      using electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incidence of cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction, 
      heart failure, and stroke) and all-cause mortality were reported every 6 months and 
      confirmed by medical record adjudication. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 
      5.9 years in 1541 participants aged 21 to 74 years, there were 188 cardiovascular 
      disease events (60 cases of myocardial infarction, 120 heart failures, and 27 
      strokes; patients may have had >1 event) and 137 all-cause deaths. In Cox 
      proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, education 
      level, physical activity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive treatment, 
      current cigarette smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, C-reactive protein 
      level, hemoglobin A1c level, phosphorus level, troponin T level, log N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, fibroblast growth factor 23 level, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, the hazard ratios associated with per 1 
      SD log of CAC were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.69; P < .001) for cardiovascular disease, 
      1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-2.02; P = .04) for myocardial infarction, 1.39 (95% CI, 
      1.10-1.76; P = .006) for heart failure, and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94-1.51; P = .15) for 
      all-cause mortality. In addition, inclusion of CAC score led to an increase in the C 
      statistic of 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.09; P < .001) for predicting cardiovascular disease 
      over use of all the above-mentioned established and novel cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Coronary artery calcification is 
      independently and significantly related to the risks of cardiovascular disease, 
      myocardial infarction, and heart failure in patients with CKD. In addition, CAC 
      improves risk prediction for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and 
      heart failure over use of established and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors 
      among patients with CKD; however, the changes in the C statistic are small.

AB  - Children on dialysis have a cardiovascular mortality risk equivalent to older adults 
      in the general population, and rapidly develop medial vascular calcification, an 
      age-associated pathology. We hypothesized that premature vascular ageing contributes 
      to calcification in children with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vessels 
      from children with Stage 5 CKD with and without dialysis had evidence of increased 
      oxidative DNA damage. The senescence markers p16 and p21 were also increased in 
      vessels from children on dialysis. Treatment of vessel rings ex vivo with calcifying 
      media increased oxidative DNA damage in vessels from children with Stage 5 CKD, but 
      not in those from healthy controls. Vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from 
      children on dialysis exhibited persistent DNA damage, impaired DNA damage repair, 
      and accelerated senescence. Under calcifying conditions vascular smooth muscle cells 
      from children on dialysis showed increased osteogenic differentiation and 
      calcification. These changes correlated with activation of the senescence-associated 
      secretory phenotype (SASP), an inflammatory phenotype characterized by the secretion 
      of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Blockade of ataxia-telangiectasia 
      mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage signaling reduced both inflammation and 
      calcification. Clinically, children on dialysis had elevated circulating levels of 
      osteogenic SASP factors that correlated with increased vascular stiffness and 
      coronary artery calcification. These data imply that dysregulated mineral metabolism 
      drives vascular "inflammaging" by promoting oxidative DNA damage, premature 
      senescence, and activation of a pro-inflammatory SASP. Drugs that target DNA damage 
      signaling or eliminate senescent cells may have the potential to prevent vascular 
      calcification in patients with advanced CKD.

TI  - Effects of phosphate binders in moderate CKD.
PG  - 1407-15
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2012030223 [doi]
AB  - Some propose using phosphate binders in the CKD population given the association 
      between higher levels of phosphorus and mortality, but their safety and efficacy in 
      this population are not well understood. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of 
      phosphate binders on parameters of mineral metabolism and vascular calcification 
      among patients with moderate to advanced CKD. We randomly assigned 148 patients with 
      estimated GFR=20-45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to calcium acetate, lanthanum carbonate, 
      sevelamer carbonate, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in mean serum 
      phosphorus from baseline to the average of months 3, 6, and 9. Serum phosphorus 
      decreased from a baseline mean of 4.2 mg/dl in both active and placebo arms to 3.9 
      mg/dl with active therapy and 4.1 mg/dl with placebo (P=0.03). Phosphate binders, 
      but not placebo, decreased mean 24-hour urine phosphorus by 22%. Median serum intact 
      parathyroid hormone remained stable with active therapy and increased with placebo 
      (P=0.002). Active therapy did not significantly affect plasma C-terminal fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 levels. Active therapy did, however, significantly increase 
      calcification of the coronary arteries and abdominal aorta (coronary: median 
      increases of 18.1% versus 0.6%, P=0.05; abdominal aorta: median increases of 15.4% 
      versus 3.4%, P=0.03). In conclusion, phosphate binders significantly lower serum and 
      urinary phosphorus and attenuate progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism among 
      patients with CKD who have normal or near-normal levels of serum phosphorus; 
      however, they also promote the progression of vascular calcification. The safety and 
      efficacy of phosphate binders in CKD remain uncertain.

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 on progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in 
      nondialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5.
PG  - 631-40
LID - AOP_15_066 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of vitamin 
      K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and vascular 
      calcification. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of vitamin K2 substitution on the 
      progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD 
      stages 3-5. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 42 nondialyzed patients with 
      CKD. The following measurements were taken at baseline and after 270 ±12 days of 
      supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose of 90 μg (menaquinone, MK-7) together with 
      10 μg of cholecalciferol (K+D group) or 10 μg of cholecalciferol (group D): common 
      carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS), basic biochemical parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix 
      Gla protein (MGP), desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), fetuin A, osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23. RESULTS: The 
      increase of CCA-IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D 
      group: from 0.95 ±0.2 mm to 1.01 ±0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 ±0.2 mm to 1.16 ±0.3, 
      P = 0.003 (ΔCCA-IMT, 0.06 ±0.08 vs 0.136 ±0.05 mm, P = 0.005, respectively). The 
      increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in the D group (ΔCACS, 
      58.1 ±106.5 AU vs 74.4 ±127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the K+D group, a significant decrease 
      in the level of dp-ucMGP and total OC was observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 270-day course of 
      vitamin K2 administration in patients with CKD stages 3-5 may reduce the progression 
      of atherosclerosis, but does not significantly affect the progression of 
      calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly changes the levels of calcification 
      promoters and inhibitors: dp-ucMGP, OC, and OPG.

TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification in Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis.
PG  - 369-377
LID - 10.1159/000494665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is seen in most patients on dialysis and is 
      strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality. Vascular calcification is 
      promoted by phosphate, which generally reaches higher levels in hemodialysis than in 
      peritoneal dialysis. However, whether vascular calcification develops less in 
      peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis is currently unknown. Therefore, we 
      compared coronary artery calcification (CAC), its progression, and calcification 
      biomarkers between patients on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. METHODS: We 
      measured CAC in 134 patients who had been treated exclusively with hemodialysis (n = 
      94) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 40) and were transplantation candidates. In 57 of 
      them (34 on hemodialysis and 23 on peritoneal dialysis), we also measured CAC 
      progression annually up to 3 years and the inactive species of 
      desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP), fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin. 
      We compared CAC cross-sectionally with Tobit regression. CAC progression was 
      compared in 2 ways: with linear mixed models as the difference in square root 
      transformed volume score per year (ΔCAC SQRV) and with Tobit mixed models. We 
      adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional cohort, CAC 
      volume scores were 92 mm3 in hemodialysis and 492 mm3 in peritoneal dialysis 
      (adjusted difference 436 mm3; 95% CI -47 to 919; p = 0.08). In the longitudinal 
      cohort, peritoneal dialysis was associated with significantly more CAC progression 
      defined as ΔCAC SQRV (adjusted difference 1.20; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.31; p = 0.03), but 
      not with Tobit mixed models (adjusted difference in CAC score increase per year 106 
      mm3; 95% CI -140 to 352; p = 0.40). Peritoneal dialysis was associated with higher 
      osteoprotegerin (adjusted p = 0.02) but not with dp-ucMGP or fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Peritoneal dialysis is not associated with less CAC or CAC progression than 
      hemodialysis, and perhaps with even more progression. This indicates that vascular 
      calcification does not develop less in peritoneal dialysis than in hemodialysis.

TI  - A Randomized Trial of Magnesium Oxide and Oral Carbon Adsorbent for Coronary Artery 
      Calcification in Predialysis CKD.
PG  - 1073-1085
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2018111150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing strategies for managing coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      in patients with CKD is an important clinical challenge. Experimental studies have 
      demonstrated that magnesium inhibits vascular calcification, whereas the uremic 
      toxin indoxyl sulfate aggravates it. METHODS: To assess the efficacy of magnesium 
      oxide (MgO) and/or the oral carbon adsorbent AST-120 for slowing CAC progression in 
      CKD, we conducted a 2-year, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, enrolling 
      patients with stage 3-4 CKD with risk factors for CAC (diabetes mellitus, history of 
      cardiovascular disease, high LDL cholesterol, or smoking). Using a two-by-two 
      factorial design, we randomly assigned patients to an MgO group or a control group, 
      and to an AST-120 group or a control group. The primary outcome was percentage 
      change in CAC score. RESULTS: We terminated the study prematurely after an interim 
      analysis with the first 125 enrolled patients (of whom 96 completed the study) 
      showed that the median change in CAC score was significantly smaller for MgO versus 
      control (11.3% versus 39.5%). The proportion of patients with an annualized 
      percentage change in CAC score of ≥15% was also significantly lower for MgO compared 
      with control (23.9% versus 62.0%). However, MgO did not suppress the progression of 
      thoracic aorta calcification. The MgO group's dropout rate was higher than that of 
      the control group (27% versus 17%), primarily due to diarrhea. The percentage change 
      in CAC score did not differ significantly between the AST-120 and control groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MgO, but not AST-120, appears to be effective in slowing CAC 
      progression. Larger-scale trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

TI  - Vitamin K Supplementation to Improve Vascular Stiffness in CKD: The K4Kidneys 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 2434-2445
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2020020225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is 
      common among patients with CKD and is an independent contributor to increased 
      vascular stiffness and vascular risk in this patient group. Vitamin K is a cofactor 
      for proteins involved in prevention of vascular calcification. Whether or not 
      vitamin K supplementation could improve arterial stiffness in patients with CKD is 
      unknown. METHODS: To determine if vitamin K supplementation might improve arterial 
      stiffness in patients in CKD, we conducted a parallel-group, double-blind, 
      randomized trial in participants aged 18 or older with CKD stage 3b or 4 (eGFR 15-45 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). We randomly assigned participants to receive 400 μg oral 
      vitamin K2 or matching placebo once daily for a year. The primary outcome was the 
      adjusted between-group difference in carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity at 12 
      months. Secondary outcomes included augmentation index, abdominal aortic 
      calcification, BP, physical function, and blood markers of mineral metabolism and 
      vascular health. We also updated a recently published meta-analysis of trials to 
      include the findings of this study. RESULTS: We included 159 randomized participants 
      in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, with 80 allocated to receive vitamin K 
      and 79 to receive placebo. Mean age was 66 years, 62 (39%) were female, and 87 (55%) 
      had CKD stage 4. We found no differences in pulse wave velocity at 12 months, 
      augmentation index at 12 months, BP, B-type natriuretic peptide, or physical 
      function. The updated meta-analysis showed no effect of vitamin K supplementation on 
      vascular stiffness or vascular calcification measures. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K2 
      supplementation did not improve vascular stiffness or other measures of vascular 
      health in this trial involving individuals with CKD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME 
      AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: Vitamin K therapy to improve vascular health in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease, ISRCTN21444964 (www.isrctn.com).

TI  - Slowing Progression of Cardiovascular Calcification With SNF472 in Patients on 
      Hemodialysis: Results of a Randomized Phase 2b Study.
PG  - 728-739
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease could be partially caused by extensive cardiovascular 
      calcification. SNF472, intravenous myo-inositol hexaphosphate, selectively inhibits 
      the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite. METHODS: This double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled phase 2b trial compared progression of coronary artery calcium 
      volume score and other measurements of cardiovascular calcification by computed 
      tomography scan during 52 weeks of treatment with SNF472 or placebo, in addition to 
      standard therapy, in adult patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving 
      hemodialysis. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to SNF472 300 mg (n=92), SNF472 600 mg 
      (n=91), or placebo (n=91) by infusion in the hemodialysis lines thrice weekly during 
      hemodialysis sessions. The primary end point was change in log coronary artery 
      calcium volume score from baseline to week 52. The primary efficacy analysis 
      combined the SNF472 treatment groups and included all patients who received at least 
      1 dose of SNF472 or placebo and had an evaluable computed tomography scan after 
      randomization. RESULTS: The mean change in coronary artery calcium volume score was 
      11% (95% CI, 7-15) for the combined SNF472 dose group and 20% (95% CI, 14-26) for 
      the placebo group (P=0.016). SNF472 compared with placebo attenuated progression of 
      calcium volume score in the aortic valve (14% [95% CI, 5-24] versus 98% [95% CI, 
      77-123]; P<0.001) but not in the thoracic aorta (23% [95% CI, 16-30] versus 28% [95% 
      CI, 19-38]; P=0.40). Death occurred in 7 patients (4%) who received SNF472 and 5 
      patients (6%) who received placebo. At least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
      occurred in 86%, 92%, and 87% of patients treated with SNF472 300 mg, SNF472 600 mg, 
      and placebo, respectively. Most adverse events were mild. Adverse events resulted in 
      discontinuation of SNF472 300 mg, SNF472 600 mg, and placebo for 14%, 29%, and 20% 
      of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, SNF472 significantly 
      attenuated the progression of coronary artery calcium and aortic valve calcification 
      in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving hemodialysis in addition to 
      standard care. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of SNF472 on 
      cardiovascular events. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique

TI  - Online Hemodiafiltration Inhibits Inflammation-Related Endothelial Dysfunction and 
      Vascular Calcification of Uremic Patients Modulating miR-223 Expression in Plasma 
      Extracellular Vesicles.
PG  - 2372-2383
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1800747 [doi]
AB  - Decreased inflammation and cardiovascular mortality are evident in patients with 
      end-stage chronic kidney disease treated by online hemodiafiltration. Extracellular 
      vesicles (EV) are mediators of cell-to-cell communication and contain different RNA 
      types. This study investigated whether mixed online hemodiafiltration (mOL-HDF) 
      beneficial effects associate with changes in the RNA content of plasma EV in chronic 
      kidney disease patients. Thirty bicarbonate hemodialysis (BHD) patients were 
      randomized 1:1 to continue BHD or switch to mOL-HDF. Concentration, size, and 
      microRNA content of plasma EV were evaluated for 9 mo; we then studied EV effects on 
      inflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis of endothelial cells (HUVEC) and on 
      osteoblast mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). mOL-HDF treatment 
      reduced different inflammatory markers, including circulating CRP, IL-6, and NGAL. 
      All hemodialysis patients showed higher plasma levels of endothelial-derived EV than 
      healthy subjects, with no significant differences between BHD and mOL-HDF. However, 
      BHD-derived EV had an increased expression of the proatherogenic miR-223 with 
      respect to healthy subjects or mOL-HDF. Compared with EV from healthy subjects, 
      those from hemodialysis patients reduced angiogenesis and increased HUVEC apoptosis 
      and VSMC calcification; however, all these detrimental effects were reduced with 
      mOL-HDF with respect to BHD. Cell transfection with miR-223 mimic or antagomiR 
      proved the role of this microRNA in EV-induced HUVEC and VSMC dysfunction. The 
      switch from BHD to mOL-HDF significantly reduced systemic inflammation and miR-223 
      expression in plasma EV, thus improving HUVEC angiogenesis and reducing VSMC 
      calcification.

LID - e010930
AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
      kidney function and arterial calcification in major vascular beds and to establish 
      whether arterial calcification mediates the relation between kidney function 
      measures and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence. Methods and Results In 2241 
      participants from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69 years, 52% female), kidney 
      function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio. All participants underwent noncontrast computed 
      tomography to quantify the amount of arterial calcification in the coronary 
      arteries, aortic arch, extracranial, and intracranial internal carotid arteries. We 
      used linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors, to evaluate the association between kidney function and arterial 
      calcification volume in the 4 vessel beds. Incidence rate of CVD was calculated in 3 
      groups of participants based on their kidney function and presence of arterial 
      calcification. We conducted mediation analysis to evaluate whether arterial 
      calcification mediates this association. We found that in age- and sex-adjusted 
      models, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin-to-creatinine 
      ratio were associated with larger calcification volumes in all 4 vascular beds. 
      Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the effect estimates. CVD 
      incidence was higher in participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and presence of arterial calcification compared with 
      individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 and no calcification. 
      After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, arterial calcification did not 
      mediate the association between kidney function measures and CVD incidence. 
      Conclusions The association of impaired kidney function and larger volumes of 
      arterial calcification is partly explained by cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial 
      calcification does not mediate the association between kidney function and CVD 
      beyond cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Examining the effects of uric acid-lowering on markers vascular of calcification and 
      CKD-MBD; A post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a 
      systemic disorder that leads to vascular calcification and accelerated 
      atherosclerosis. Uric acid has been shown to associate with vascular calcification 
      and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to suppress the 1 α-hydroxylase 
      enzyme leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and higher intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid 
      would reduce CIMT, calcification propensity, and circulating markers of CKD-MBD in 
      CKD. METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind study of 80 
      patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia who received allopurinol or placebo for 
      12 weeks. CIMT and T50 were measured as markers of vascular disease and serum 
      calcification propensity, respectively. The following markers of CKD-MBD were 
      measured: serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, and fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Expression of extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase was evaluated in 
      endothelial cells of study participants. FINDINGS: Allopurinol successfully lowered 
      serum uric acid levels compared to placebo with an estimate of -3.3 mg/dL (95% C.I. 
      -4.1,-2.5; p < 0.0001). After 12 weeks, however, we found no significant change in 
      CIMT or serum T50. There was not a significant change in vitamin D metabolites, 
      iPTH, FGF-23, or the expression of endothelial 1α-hydroxylase. CONCLUSION: These 
      data suggest that factors other than uric acid may play a more important role in the 
      regulation of CKD- MBD including vascular calcification and vitamin D metabolism in 
      patients with CKD.

TI  - A Randomized Trial on the Effect of Phosphate Reduction on Vascular End Points in 
      CKD (IMPROVE-CKD).
PG  - 2653-2666

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF23), arterial calcification, and cardiovascular mortality. Effects of 
      phosphate-lowering medication on vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in 
      CKD remain uncertain. METHODS: To assess the effects of non-calcium-based phosphate 
      binders on intermediate cardiovascular markers, we conducted a multicenter, 
      double-blind trial, randomizing 278 participants with stage 3b or 4 CKD and serum 
      phosphate >1.00 mmol/L (3.10 mg/dl) to 500 mg lanthanum carbonate or matched placebo 
      thrice daily for 96 weeks. We analyzed the primary outcome, carotid-femoral pulse 
      wave velocity, using a linear mixed effects model for repeated measures. Secondary 
      outcomes included abdominal aortic calcification and serum and urine markers of 
      mineral metabolism. RESULTS: A total of 138 participants received lanthanum and 140 
      received placebo (mean age 63.1 years; 69% male, 64% White). Mean eGFR was 26.6 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2); 45% of participants had diabetes and 32% had cardiovascular 
      disease. Mean serum phosphate was 1.25 mmol/L (3.87 mg/dl), mean pulse wave velocity 
      was 10.8 m/s, and 81.3% had abdominal aortic calcification at baseline. At 96 weeks, 
      pulse wave velocity did not differ significantly between groups, nor did abdominal 
      aortic calcification, serum phosphate, parathyroid hormone, FGF23, and 24-hour 
      urinary phosphate. Serious adverse events occurred in 63 (46%) participants 
      prescribed lanthanum and 66 (47%) prescribed placebo. Although recruitment to target 
      was not achieved, additional analysis suggested this was unlikely to have 
      significantly affected the principle findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage 
      3b/4 CKD, treatment with lanthanum over 96 weeks did not affect arterial stiffness 
      or aortic calcification compared with placebo. These findings do not support the 
      role of intestinal phosphate binders to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with 
      CKD who have normophosphatemia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION

TI  - Is arterial calcification in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease a 
      rare finding?
PG  - 696-702
LID - 10.1111/nep.13480 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate if calcification and intimal media thickness (IMT) of arteries 
      are present in children and adolescents with end-stage renal disease and to describe 
      the risk factors associated with these alterations. METHODS: In an observational, 
      cross-sectional prospective study, 68 patients were evaluated at the time of renal 
      transplantation. A fragment of the inferior epigastric artery was removed during 
      surgery for histopathological analysis to verify the presence or not of arterial 
      calcification. Two outcomes were considered: the presence of calcium deposition and 
      the measurement of the IMT of the artery. The potential exposure variables were: 
      age, chronic kidney disease aetiology, diagnosis time, systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP), use of oral active vitamin D, homocysteine and C-reactive protein. RESULTS: 
      No arterial calcification was observed in the studied sample. The median value of 
      the IMT of the inferior epigastric artery was 166 μm (interquartile 
      range = 130-208). SBP standard deviation score and age were the only factors 
      associated with this outcome. There was no statistical interaction between SBP and 
      age with the IMT (P = 0.280). CONCLUSION: Arterial calcification is rare in children 
      and adolescents with end-stage renal disease. The factors associated with IMT were 
      age and SBP.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Coronary Artery Calcification Among Patients With 
      CKD: The CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent among 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases risks for cardiovascular 
      disease events and mortality. We hypothesized that a novel serum measure of 
      calcification propensity is associated with CAC among patients with CKD stages 2 
      to 4. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Participants 
      from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study with baseline (n=1,274) and 
      follow-up (n=780) CAC measurements. PREDICTORS: Calcification propensity, quantified 
      as transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, 
      with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. Covariates 
      included age, sex, race/ethnicity, clinical site, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, proteinuria, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive 
      medications, current smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, total cholesterol 
      level, and use of statin medications. OUTCOMES: CAC prevalence, severity, incidence, 
      and progression. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear 
      models. RESULTS: At baseline, 824 (65%) participants had prevalent CAC. After 
      multivariable adjustment, T(50) was not associated with CAC prevalence but was 
      significantly associated with greater CAC severity among participants with prevalent 
      CAC: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 21% (95% CI, 6%-38%) greater CAC severity. 
      Among 780 participants followed up an average of 3 years later, 65 (20%) without 
      baseline CAC developed incident CAC, while 89 (19%) with baseline CAC had 
      progression, defined as annual increase≥100 Agatston units. After multivariable 
      adjustment, T(50) was not associated with incident CAC but was significantly 
      associated with CAC progression: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 28% (95% CI, 
      7%-53%) higher risk for CAC progression. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias in 
      follow-up analyses; inability to distinguish intimal from medial calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2 to 4, higher serum calcification 
      propensity is associated with more severe CAC and CAC progression.

TI  - Intraoperative Arterial Biopsy in Incident Hemodialysis Patients: Differences 
      Observed.
PG  - 54-61
LID - 10.1159/000500486 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial calcification (AC) is a common complication in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients that starts to develop before these patients need renal 
      replacement therapy. In these patients, calcification can involve tunica intima or 
      tunica media. This study has looked for the prevalence, severity, and distribution 
      of arterial wall calcification in incident hemodialysis patients through 
      intraoperative arterial biopsy obtained during creation of arteriovenous vascular 
      access for hemodialysis. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults 
      (98 male and 74 female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained 
      arterial samples, all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF23), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D. RESULTS: Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC 
      (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal (subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), 
      while 21 (12%) had both intimal and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six 
      patients (50%) were devoid of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly 
      higher serum level of PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose 
      significant difference in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. 
      On the other hand, there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, 
      serum PTH, and FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification. 
      CONCLUSION: Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly in 
      tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification intensity.

TI  - Different type and dosage of heparin were not associated with the progression of 
      coronary artery calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 551-558
LID - 10.1111/nep.13632 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Several studies have verified that unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low 
      molecular heparin (LWMH) can induce bone loss, and bone mineral density has been 
      inversely associated with vascular calcification in some clinical researches. But 
      few have focused on the relationship between types and dosages of heparin and the 
      progression of vascular calcification. We observed the progression of coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients who were 
      treated with UFH and LMWH. METHODS: This was a prospective prevalent cohort study of 
      MHD patients. Computed tomography was performed at enrolment and 2 years after 
      enrolment, and CAC score was obtained. Demographic and clinical data, baseline and 
      time-average laboratory indices were collected. Multiple linear regression and 
      logistic regression were used to estimate the influencing factors of progression of 
      CAC. RESULTS: In this study, (i) we initially enrolled 69 HD patients, and then 56 
      patients finished the follow-up. (ii) Among the total 56 patients, 27 patients 
      (48.2%) were treated with UFH, 14 (25.0%) with LMWH and 15 (26.8%) with both. The 
      median baseline CAC scores of three groups (UFH, LMWH and both users) were 91.0 
      (1.0, 1052.0), 134.0 (0, 1292.0) and 250.5 (27.0, 1139.0), respectively, with no 
      significant difference (P = 0.663); the median CAC progression scores were 42.0 (0, 
      364.0), 172.0 (7.0, 653.0) and 118.5 (0, 434.0), respectively, with no significant 
      difference (P = 0.660). (iii) Pearson and spearman correlation analysis shown that 
      the progression of CAC was not associated with cumulative dosage of heparin used. 
      (iv) After adjusted for diabetes mellitus, time-averaged intact parathyroid hormone, 
      phosphate and alkaline phosphatase, logistic regression analysis showed using 
      different types of heparin was not an independent risk factor for CAC progression; 
      and multiple linear regression analysis showed that the type of heparin used was not 
      associated with CAC progression. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences 
      in the effects of the types and dosages of heparin on CAC progression in patients on 
      haemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with CKD are at high risk for cardiovascular 
      disease, ESKD, and mortality. Vascular calcification is one pathway through which 
      cardiovascular disease risks are increased. We hypothesized that a novel measure of 
      serum calcification propensity is associated with cardiovascular disease events, 
      ESKD, and all-cause mortality among patients with CKD stages 2-4. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Among 3404 participants from the prospective, 
      longitudinal Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, we quantified calcification 
      propensity as the transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein 
      particles, with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. We 
      used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the 
      associations of T(50) with risks of adjudicated atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
      disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), 
      adjudicated heart failure, ESKD, and mortality. RESULTS: The mean T(50) was 313 (SD 
      79) minutes. Over an average 7.1 (SD 3.1) years of follow-up, we observed 571 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, 633 heart failure events, 887 ESKD 
      events, and 924 deaths. With adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk 
      factors, lower T(50) was significantly associated with higher risk of 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR] per SD lower T(50), 1.14; 
      95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.25), ESKD within 3 years from baseline 
      (HR per SD lower T(50), 1.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 1.86), and all-cause mortality (HR per 
      SD lower T(50), 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.24), but not heart failure (HR per SD lower 
      T(50), 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.15). After adjustment for eGFR and 24-hour urinary 
      protein, T(50) was not associated with risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
      disease, ESKD, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2-4, 
      higher serum calcification propensity is associated with atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease events, ESKD, and all-cause mortality, but this association 
      was not independent of kidney function. PODCAST: This article contains a podcast at

AB  - BACKWARD: Cardiovascular events are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Inflammation and mineral-bone disorder 
      are pathological conditions that have been associated with an increased 
      cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: Show paricalcitol regulation overinflammatory, 
      fibrotic and mineral disorder parameters in CKD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective 
      Study in 46 CKD stages III-V patients without dialysis patients whith elevated 
      parathormone in which we introduced paricalcitol. We evaluated classic and newest 
      mineral and bone metabolism serum parameters (calcium, phosphorus, parathormone, 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 [FGF-23], Klotho, calcidiol), inflammatory-fibrosis and 
      anticalcifying parameters (interleukin-6 and 10, tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF- α], 
      transforming growth factor-b [TGF-β],bone morphogenic protein-7 [BMP-7] and 
      fetuin-A) for four months. RESULTS: At the end of study soluble Klotho increased 
      (p=.001), FGF-23 remained stable, calcium and phosphorus levels were not increased, 
      calcidiol increased (p=.010) and PTH decreased (p=.002). Inflammation-fibrosis and 
      calcification parameters showed positive regulation after paricalcitol treatment: 
      interleukin-6 decreased significantly (p=.001) and also TNF-α did (p=.005), on the 
      contrary, interleukin-10 and fetuin-A increased (p=.001 for both). Anti-fibrosis 
      marker BMP-7 increased (p=.001) and TGF-b decreased (p=.001). We did not find 
      significant changes in renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Paricalcitol treatment might be 
      profitable in regulating inflammatory and anticalcificant parameters, unmodified 
      calcium or phosphorus seric levels and preserving kidney function in renal patients 
      with no dialysis. Our selected parameters could indicate paricalcitol effects in 
      mineral and endothelial disorder related to renal disease.

TI  - Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12888 [doi]
AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification 
      score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 
      2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The 
      difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in the 
      external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total iliac 
      vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease, and 
      diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk factor 
      (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total iliac 
      vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation 
      protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to 
      calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular calcification prior to 
      transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical decisions and to improve 
      patient safety and outcome in increasingly older transplant recipients.

TI  - Significance of acPWV for Survival of Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - 10.3390/medicina56090435 [doi]
LID - 435
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Abnormal arterial stiffness (AS) is a major complication 
      in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients treated by dialysis. Our study aimed to 
      determine the significance of AS for survival of prevalent dialysis patients, as 
      well as its association with cardiovascular parameters or vascular calcification 
      promoters/inhibitors or both and AS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 80 
      adult hemodialysis patients. Besides standard laboratory analyses, we also 
      determined promoters and inhibitors of vascular calcification (bone biomarkers): 
      serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), soluble Klotho, intact 
      parathormone (iPTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin, AS 
      measured as ankle carotid pulse wave velocity (acPWV), Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), 
      and vascular calcification (VC) score. Patients were monitored for up to 28 months. 
      According to the median acPWV value, we divided patients into a group with acPWV ≤ 
      8.8 m/s, and a group with acPWV > 8.8 m/s, and the two groups were compared. 
      RESULTS: Values for bone biomarkers were similar in both groups. Mean arterial blood 
      pressure (MAP), central systolic and diastolic brachial blood pressure, heart rate, 
      and pulse pressure were higher in the group with acPWV > 8.8 m/s than in the group 
      with acPWV ≤ 8.8 m/s. The mortality was higher for patients with acPWV > 8.8 m/s at 
      any given time over 28 months of follow-up. In multivariable analysis, predictors of 
      higher acPWV were age >60.5, higher pulse rate, and higher central systolic or 
      brachial diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, we advise 
      the measurement of acPWV preferentially in younger dialysis patients for prognosis, 
      as well as intervention planning before the development of irreversible changes in 
      blood vessels. In addition, measuring central systolic blood pressure seems to be 
      useful for monitoring AS in prevalent hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a life threatening complication in renal patients. Of 
      great importance is the identification of concomitant factors for calciphylaxis. Due 
      to the variability of clinical presentation the evaluation of such factors may be 
      obscured when calciphylaxis diagnosis is based just on clinical features. We aimed 
      to characterize associated factors only in patients with calciphylaxis proven by 
      histomorphological parameters in addition to clinical presentation. METHODS: In a 
      single center retrospective study we analyzed 15 patients in an 8 year period from 
      2008 to 2016. Only patients with clinical features and histomorphological proof of 
      calciphylaxis were included. Criteria for histological diagnosis of calciphylaxis 
      were intimal hyperplasia, micro thrombi or von Kossa stain positive media 
      calcification. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 64.8 years. Nine patients (60%) 
      were female; 12 (80%) were obese with a Body-Mass-Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m(2); 3 (20%) 
      had no renal disease; 12 (80%) had CKD 4 or 5 and 10 (66.7%) had end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD). One-year mortality in the entire cohort was 73.3%. With respect to 
      medication history, the majority of patients (n = 13 (86.7%)) received vitamin K 
      antagonists (VKA); 10 (66.7%) were treated with vitamin D; 6 (40%) had oral calcium 
      supplementation; 5 (33.3%) had been treated with corticosteroids; 12 (80%) were on 
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI); 13 (86.7%) patients had a clinical proven 
      hyperparathyroidism. Ten (66.7%) patients presented with hypoalbuminemia at 
      diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of biopsy proven calciphylaxis demonstrates 
      that especially treatment with vitamin K antagonists and liver dysfunction are most 
      important concomitant factors in development of calciphylaxis. As progression and 
      development of calciphylaxis are chronic rather than acute processes, early use of 
      DOACs instead of VKA might be beneficial and reduce the incidence of calciphylaxis.

TI  - Phenotypic features of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 422-434
LID - 10.1111/joim.13012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5) are predisposed to 
      vascular calcification (VC), but the combined effect of factors associated with VC 
      was sparsely investigated. We applied the relaxed linear separability (RLS) feature 
      selection model to identify features that concomitantly associate with VC in CKD5 
      patients. METHODS: Epigastric arteries collected during surgery from living donor 
      kidney transplant recipients were examined to score the histological extent of 
      medial VC. Sixty-two phenotypic features in 152 patients were entered into RLS model 
      to differentiate between no-minimal VC (n = 93; score 0-1) and moderate-extensive VC 
      (n = 59; score 2-3). The subset of features associated with VC was selected on the 
      basis of cross-validation procedure. The strength of association of the selected 
      features with VC was expressed by the absolute value of 'RLS factor'. RESULTS: Among 
      62 features, a subset of 17 features provided optimal prediction of VC with 89% of 
      patients correctly classified into their groups. The 17 features included 
      traditional risk factors (diabetes, age, cholesterol, BMI and male sex) and markers 
      of bone metabolism, endothelial function, metabolites, serum antibodies and 
      mitochondrial-derived peptide. Positive RLS factors range from 1.26 to 4.05 
      indicating features associated with increased risk of VC, and negative RLS factors 
      range from -0.95 to -1.83 indicating features associated with reduced risk of VC. 
      CONCLUSION: The RLS model identified 17 features including novel biomarkers and 
      traditional risk factors that together concomitantly associated with medial VC. 
      These results may inform further investigations of factors promoting VC in CKD5 
      patients.

      Kidney and Pancreas-Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 177-186
LID - 10.1159/000502328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) 
      score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. METHODS: Between the 
      years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored 
      for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, 
      cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC 
      (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 
      months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. 
      For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and 
      mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar 
      after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and 
      diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high 
      versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 
      (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), 
      and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking 
      history-adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with 
      high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than 
      recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted 
      risk-lowering strategies.

      kidney disease (CKD). Keeping in mind, the end goal to assess the genuine effect of 
      mineral bone disease in the pathogenesis of blood vessel calcification during the 
      pre-dialysis course of CKD, we assessed the prevalence and extent of abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) in nondiabetic CKD patients recently starting 
      hemodialysis (HD). Eighty-one patients with end-stage renal disease beginning HD 
      over a one-month period were selected. They underwent a detailed clinical 
      examination and laboratory evaluation, including serum calcium, phosphorus, 
      parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), and alkaline phosphatase 
      were measured, and spiral computed tomography was performed to evaluate AAC score. 
      AAC was present in 64 patients (79%). There was a significant correlation between 
      the AAC score and age (r = 0.609, P <0.001) and FGF-23 (r = 0.800, P <0.001). This 
      study suggests that the prevalence and extent of AAC are critical in incident HD 
      patients. Serum FGF-23 level is the sole statistically significant correlate of AAC 
      in these patients.

TI  - Does statins promote vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 137-148
LID - 10.1111/eci.12718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve 
      survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is 
      unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and 
      mortality in ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; 
      median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal 
      dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor 
      (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated 
      in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism. 
      RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate 
      analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, 
      male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and 
      mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use 
      of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 
      patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. 
      In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. 
      CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of 
      inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular 
      calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and 
      is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the 
      association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial stiffness 
      has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING trial (vitamin K2 
      In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the association between the 
      change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial stiffness following 8 weeks of 
      menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360 μg once daily) among renal 
      transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness was measured using 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical vitamin K deficiency was 
      defined as plasma concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla 
      protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had 
      subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% 
      reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV 
      post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 ± 1.5 m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also 
      significantly reduced by 55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a 
      reduction in the prevalence of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When 
      controlled for age, durations of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 
      24-hour mean arterial pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was 
      independently associated with the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration 
      (P = .014).Among renal transplant recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 
      supplementation was associated with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency 
      and arterial stiffness. (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02517580).

PG  - 755-763
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.265449 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the presence of 
      carotid artery calcification (CAC) and pulp stone (PS). A total of 60 chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients (30 CAC positive, 30 CAC negative) participated in this 
      study. The mean age of patients was 54.7 ± 16.4 years, and 32 (53%) of them were 
      male. CAC was defined as the presence of heterogeneous nodular opacities in the soft 
      tissue in C3-C4 intervertebral area. Panoramic radiographs of the patients were 
      evaluated for CAC and PS by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. PS was 
      evaluated in all healthy, decayed, and restored teeth except the third molar teeth, 
      in the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. The Statistical Package for the Social 
      Sciences (version 20.0; SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA) was used. A 
      probability P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The prevalence of PS 
      in this study was 30% (18 patients) all group. A total of 1324 teeth were analyzed 
      and PS was detected in 237 teeth (17.9%). The occurrence of PS in teeth in 
      CAC-positive group (10 patients, 17.2% of 654 teeth) was similar to that in 
      CAC-negative group (8 patient, 18.3% of 670 teeth). There was no statistical 
      correlation between CAC and PS in chronic HD patients (P = 0.08). In the subgroup 
      analysis, the presence of diabetes (P = 0.003), parathormone level (P = 0.02), 
      calcium × phosphorus product (P = 0.04), and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002) 
      were higher, and duration of HD (P = 0.03) was significantly longer in patients with 
      CAC-positive and PS. In chronic HD patients, the presence of PS was not a strong 
      predictor for the presence of CAC.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification is superior to other arteries calcification in 
      predicting the mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients - a 8 years cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a growing concern that abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) has a predictive effect on the prognosis of patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, whether other vascular calcification (VC) 
      can predict the occurrence of adverse events in patients, and whether it is 
      necessary to assess the calcification of other blood vessels remains controversial. 
      This study aimed to assess VC in different sites using X-ray films, and to 
      investigate the predictive effects of VC at different sites on all-cause mortality 
      and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: The 
      data of Radiographs (lateral abdominal plain film, frontal pelvic radiograph and 
      both hands radiograph) were collected to evaluate the calcification of abdominal 
      aorta, iliac artery, femoral artery, radial artery, and finger arteries. Patients' 
      demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory data were recorded. The total 
      follow-up period was 8 years, and the time and cause of death were recorded. 
      Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. COX regression analysis 
      was used to examine independent predictors of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. 
      RESULTS: One hundred fifty PD patients were included, a total of 79 patients (52.7%) 
      died at the end of follow-up. After adjusting variables in the multivariate COX 
      regression analysis, AAC was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in PD 
      patients (HR = 2.089, 95% CI: 1.089-4.042, P = 0.029), and was also an independent 
      predictor of CV mortality (HR = 4.660, 95% CI: 1.852-11.725, P = 0.001). We also 
      found that femoral artery calcification had a predictive effect on all-cause and CV 
      mortality. But the calcification in iliac artery, radial artery, and finger arteries 
      were not independent predictors of patients' all-cause and CV mortality in PD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: AAC was more common in PD patients and was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause mortality and CV mortality. The femoral artery calcification 
      also can predict the mortality, but the calcification of iliac artery, radial 
      artery, and finger arteries cannot predict the mortality of PD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of vitamin D supplementation on vascular calcification (VC) in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. The objective of this 
      study was to evaluate the effects of long-term cholecalciferol supplementation on VC 
      in nondialysis patients with CKD stages 3-4 with hypovitaminosis D. DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: Eighty patients aged 18-85 years with creatinine clearance between 15 and 
      60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and serum 25(OH)D level < 30 ng/mL were enrolled in a 18-month 
      prospective study. Individuals with vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      [25(OH)D] level between 16 and 29 ng/mL) were included in a randomized, 
      double-blind, two-arm study to receive cholecalciferol or placebo. Patients with 
      vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 15 ng/mL] were included in an observational study 
      and mandatorily received cholecalciferol. The coronary artery calcium score was 
      obtained by multislice computed tomography at baseline and the 18th month. RESULTS: 
      During the study, VC did not change in the treated insufficient group (418 [81-611] 
      to 364 [232-817] AU, P = 0.25) but increased in the placebo group (118 [37-421] to 
      199 [49-490] AU, P = 0.01). The calcium score change was inversely correlated with 
      25(OH)D change (r = -0.45; P = 0.037) in the treated insufficient group but not in 
      the placebo group. Renal function did not change in the insufficient, treated, and 
      placebo groups. In multivariate analysis, there was no difference in VC progression 
      between the treated and placebo insufficient groups (interaction P = 0.92). In the 
      deficient group, VC progressed (265 [84-733] to 333 [157-745] AU; P = 0.006) and 
      renal function declined (33 [26-43] to 23 [17-49] mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.04). The 
      calcium score change was inversely correlated with cholecalciferol cumulative doses 
      (r = -0.41; P = 0.048) and kidney function change (r = -0.43; P = 0.033) but not 
      with 25(OH)D change (r = -0.08; P = 0.69). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did 
      not attenuate VC progression in CKD patients with hypovitaminosis D. CONCLUSION: 
      Vitamin D supplementation did not attenuate VC progression in CKD patients with 
      hypovitaminosis D.

TI  - Progression of coronary artery calcification in conventional hemodialysis, nocturnal 
      hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation.
PG  - e0244639

LID - e0244639
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. An 
      important driver of vascular calcification is high phosphate levels, but these 
      become lower when patients initiate nocturnal hemodialysis or receive a kidney 
      transplant. However, it is unknown whether nocturnal hemodialysis or kidney 
      transplantation mitigate vascular calcification. Therefore, we compared progression 
      of coronary artery calcification (CAC) between patients treated with conventional 
      hemodialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We 
      measured CAC annually up to 3 years in 114 patients with ESRD that were 
      transplantation candidates: 32 that continued conventional hemodialysis, 34 that 
      initiated nocturnal hemodialysis (≥4x 8 hours/week), and 48 that received a kidney 
      transplant. We compared CAC progression between groups as the difference in square 
      root transformed volume scores per year (ΔCAC SQRV) using linear mixed models. 
      Reference category was conventional hemodialysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the study 
      population was 53 ±13 years, 75 (66%) were male, and median dialysis duration was 28 
      (IQR 12-56) months. Median CAC score at enrollment was 171 (IQR 10-647), which did 
      not differ significantly between treatment groups (P = 0.83). Compared to 
      conventional hemodialysis, CAC progression was non-significantly different in 
      nocturnal hemodialysis -0.10 (95% CI -0.77 to 0.57) and kidney transplantation -0.33 
      (95% CI -0.96 to 0.29) in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal hemodialysis and 
      kidney transplantation are not associated with significantly less CAC progression 
      compared to conventional hemodialysis during up to 3 years follow-up. Further 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings, to determine which type of 
      calcification is measured with CAC in end-stage renal disease, and whether that 
      reflects cardiovascular risk.

AB  - The aim of this study was to find a correlation between acute-phase proteins (APPs) 
      and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) as well as the impact APPs on AAC in 
      chronic dialysis patients (CDPs). Native lateral lumbar radiography and biochemical 
      analysis were performed in 112 CDPs (aged 60.0 ± 5.43 years) to estimate and score 
      AAC and biochemical values of APPs. The mean AAC score was 8.39 ± 5.43. We detected 
      16 (14.28%) CDPs without AAC and 96 (85.71%) CDPs with AAC (10 ± 5.43). The number 
      of CDPs with AAC ≤4 was 34 (30.36%) with mean AAC score of 1.85 ± 1.94. By multiple 
      regression analysis, we found positive correlation between AAC and ferritin (β = 
      0.004398, P = 0.0085) and AAC and C-reactive protein [(CRP), β = 0.1972, P = 
      0.0178]. Sensitivity/specificity pairs and criterion variables (CrVs) were as 
      follows: for CRP: 44.21%, 100%, and CrV ≥6 and for ferritin: 83.16%, 56.25%, and CrV 
      ≥196.32. The area under curve (AUC) for CRP and ferritin was 0.721 (P <0.0001) and 
      0.730 (P <0.0026), respectively. Fibrinogen and serum iron AUC in the prediction of 
      AAC were 0.533 (P = 0.5749) and 0.618 (P = 0.0795), respectively. CRP and ferritin 
      were the most powerful APPs involved in the promotion of AAC; serum iron and 
      fibrinogen were shown as lower activity promoters in CDPs. Serum albumin showed 
      inverse activity on AAC.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) is a recently recognized complication in dialysis and 
      it is associated with a poor outcome. We estimated the prevalence of PHTN and its 
      association with vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. One hundred and thirteen adult CKD patients were 
      included in this study, of which 56 (49.6%) were on conservative treatment 
      (nondialysis group) and 57 (50.4%) were on maintenance HD (dialysis group). 
      Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were collected and compared 
      between the groups. Thirty-nine (69.6%) and 33 (57.8%) males were included in 
      nondialysis and dialysis group, respectively. Mean age was 47.5 ± 13.7 in 
      nondialysis group and 52.8 ± 13.9 in the dialysis group. PHTN was estimated using 
      Doppler echocardiography and peripheral vascular calcification by lateral lumbar 
      X-ray with aortic calcification scoring. Patients with and without PHTN and vascular 
      calcification in dialysis and nondialysis group were compared. PHTN was found in 55 
      patients (48.7%) and it was high in patients on dialysis compared to 
      nondialysis(59.6% vs. 37.5%, P <0.019). Abdominal aortic calcification was present 
      in 35 patients (30.9%), dialysis versus nondialysis group was 22.8% and 39.3%. 
      Increased left atrial diameter was significantly associated with PHTN (P <0.003), 
      whereas peripheral artery calcification was not related to PHT (P = 0.248). The 
      prevalence of PHTN in CKD was 48.7% which was higher in dialysis group than non 
      dialysis group. Increased left atrial (LA) diameter was associated with PHTN but not 
      peripheral arterial calcification.

TI  - The impact of vascular calcification among dialysis-dependent South African 
      patients: A 5-year follow-up study .
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.5414/CN110010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In Western 
      countries, Blacks appear to have lesser degrees of vascular calcification compared 
      to non-Blacks. However, there is no published data from sub-Saharan Africa. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study assessed the 5-year change in vascular 
      calcification and mortality in a previously published cohort of patients with ESRD. 
      Vascular calcification was assessed by abdominal aortic calcification score and 
      vascular stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: 66 of the original 74 
      participants studied at baseline were identified. The median age was 46.6 years 
      (37.6 - 59.2), and 57.6% were women. Abdominal aortic calcification showed no 
      progression among Blacks (baseline range 0 - 5, follow-up range 0 - 8 (p = 1.00)), 
      but a trend to progression among non-Blacks (baseline range 0 - 19, follow up range 
      0 - 22 (p = 0.066)). Black participants did not display a survival advantage 
      (p = 0.870). Non-Blacks had higher parathyroidectomy rates than Blacks with 9/30 
      cases compared to 2/36 (p = 0.036). After adjustment for parathyroidectomy at 
      follow-up, the odds ratio of having abdominal vascular calcification score of ≥ 1 
      amongst non-Blacks was 8.6-fold greater compared to Blacks (p = 0.03). A positive 
      correlation (r = 0.5) was observed between PWV and abdominal aortic calcification 
      (p = 0.047). Elevated baseline coronary artery calcification score and FGF-23 level 
      at baseline were not associated with a difference in mortality. CONCLUSION: There 
      was no significant progression in vascular calcification among Blacks. After 
      adjusting for increased parathyroidectomy rates, there was a greater progression of 
      vascular calcification amongst non-Blacks compared to Blacks.

TI  - Localization, Morphologic Features, and Chemical Composition of 
      Calciphylaxis-Related Skin Deposits in Patients With Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy.
PG  - 789-796
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.0381 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), a rare, potentially fatal, disease 
      with calcium deposits in skin, mostly affects patients with end-stage renal disease 
      who are receiving dialysis. Chemical composition and structure of CUA calcifications 
      have been poorly described. OBJECTIVES: To describe the localization and morphologic 
      features and determine the precise chemical composition of CUA-related calcium 
      deposits in skin, and identify any mortality-associated factors. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 
      French hospitals including consecutive adults diagnosed with CUA between January 1, 
      2006, and January 1, 2017, confirmed according to Hayashi clinical and histologic 
      criteria. Patients with normal renal function were excluded. For comparison, 5 skin 
      samples from patients with arteriolosclerosis and 5 others from the negative margins 
      of skin-carcinoma resection specimens were also analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Localization and morphologic features of the CUA-related cutaneous calcium 
      deposits were assessed with optical microscopy and field-emission-scanning electron 
      microscopy, and the chemical compositions of those deposits were evaluated with μ 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive 
      radiographs. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (median [range] age, 64 [33-89] years; 26 
      [72%] female) were included, and 29 cutaneous biopsies were analyzed. Calcific 
      uremic arteriolopathy and arteriolosclerosis skin calcifications were composed of 
      pure calcium-phosphate apatite. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy vascular 
      calcifications were always circumferential, found in small to medium-sized vessels, 
      with interstitial deposits in 22 (76%) of the samples. A thrombosis, most often in 
      noncalcified capillary lumens in the superficial dermis, was seen in 5 samples from 
      patients with CUA. Except for calcium deposits, the vessel structure of patients 
      with CUA appeared normal, unlike thickened arteriolosclerotic vessel walls. Twelve 
      (33%) patients died of CUA. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Calcific uremic 
      arteriolopathy-related skin calcifications were exclusively composed of pure 
      calcium-phosphate apatite, localized circumferentially in small to medium-sized 
      vessels and often associated with interstitial deposits, suggesting its pathogenesis 
      differs from that of arteriolosclerosis. Although the chemical compositions of CUA 
      and arteriolosclerosis calcifications were similar, the vessels' appearances and 
      deposit localizations differed, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms.

TI  - A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study of long-term and incident hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 615-626
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00593-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular morphology and function in long-term survivors of 
      hemodialysis are not well described. METHODS: Single-center cross-sectional study 
      nested within a prospective cohort study of 15 long-term (> 7.5 years) and 15 
      matched incident (< 6 months) hemodialysis patients with 15 external matched 
      controls. Evaluations included heart structure, function and fibrosis (myocardial 
      longitudinal relaxation time, native T1), and aortic dimensions and elasticity, 
      using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      scores were evaluated from computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Incident hemodialysis 
      patients had significantly increased left ventricular mass, greater aortic 
      dimensions and reduced aortic distensibility compared to long-term survivors, 
      whereas the CAC score was significantly higher in long-term than incident patients, 
      median (95% CI) 1127 (10-3861) vs 14 (0-268). Both incident and long-term 
      hemodialysis groups had significantly higher native T1 values compared to controls, 
      mean (95% CI) 1300 ms (1273-1326), 1274 ms (1243-1305) versus 1224 ms (1202-1246), 
      respectively, suggesting interstitial fibrosis or edema. Compared to controls, both 
      hemodialysis groups also had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction: 
      48.7% (43.6-53.9), 54.0% (48.3-59.7) versus 62.2% (58.0-66.4) and longitudinal 
      strain: 14.0% (11.7-16.2), 15.2% (12.7-17.7) versus 19.6% (17.8-21.5). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Incident hemodialysis patients had larger left ventricular mass and unfavorable 
      aortic structure and function compared to long-term survivors, despite a lower CAC 
      burden. Long-term survivors, despite normal ventricular mass and volumes, had signs 
      of fibrosis or edema, given their significantly increased native T1 values.

TI  - Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification have a 
      large hydrodynamic radius of secondary calciprotein particles.
PG  - 992-1000
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The size of secondary calciprotein particles (CPP2) and the speed of 
      transformation (T50) from primary calciprotein particles (CPP1) to CPP2 in serum may 
      be associated with vascular calcification (VC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). METHODS: We developed a high throughput, microplate-based assay using 
      dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure the transformation of CPP1 to CPP2, 
      hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of CPP1 and CPP2, T50 and aggregation of CPP2. We used this 
      DLS assay to test the hypothesis that a large Rh of CPP2 and/or a fast T50 are 
      associated with VC in 45 participants with CKD Stages 4-5 (22 without VC and 23 with 
      VC) and 17 healthy volunteers (HV). VC was defined as a Kauppila score >6 or an 
      Adragao score ≥3. RESULTS: CKD participants with VC had larger cumulants Rh of CPP2 
      {370 nm [interquartile range (IQR) 272-566]} compared with CKD participants without 
      VC [212 nm (IQR 169-315)] and compared with HV [168 nm (IQR 145-352), P < 0.01 for 
      each]. More CPP2 were in aggregates in CKD participants with VC than those without 
      VC (70% versus 36%). The odds of having VC increased by 9% with every 10 nm increase 
      in the Rh of CPP2, after adjusting for age, diabetes, serum calcium and phosphate 
      [odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.16, P = 0.005]. The area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve for VC of CPP2 size was 0.75 (95% 
      CI 0.60, 0.90). T50 was similar in CKD participants with and without VC, although 
      both groups had a lower T50 than HV. CONCLUSIONS: Rh of CPP2, but not T50, is 
      independently associated with VC in patients with CKD Stages 4-5.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is a fatal complication in 
      dialysis. AoAC progression-related molecules in continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) remain unclear. METHODS: AoAC was estimated using plain chest 
      radiography scoring (AoACS) in 30 CAPD patients (age 49.3 ± 13.4 years). AoAC 
      progression was defined as increased AoACS on follow-up chest X-ray at the end of 
      the study (progressors). Fibroblast growth factor-23 and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were 
      measured. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 38.5 months. Progressors were older, had 
      shorter PD vintage, higher body mass index, and higher serum OPG levels (255.6 ± 
      109.2 pg/mL) than nonprogressors (183.4 ± 68.2 pg/mL; p = 0.0400). Progressors also 
      showed higher pulse pressure (62.4 ± 20.0 mm Hg) and pulse wave velocity (1,909.9 ± 
      310.6 cm/s) than nonprogressors (48.5 ± 13.6 mm Hg; p = 0.0030 and 1,390.1 ± 252.8 
      cm/s; p = 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSION: AoAC progression was associated with 
      increased aortic stiffness. OPG may be associated with AoAC progression in CAPD.

TI  - Biomarkers of vascular calcification and mortality in patients with ESRD.
PG  - 745-55
LID - 10.2215/CJN.05450513 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among patients undergoing dialysis and 
      is associated with mortality. Factors such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin 
      (OPN), bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7), and fetuin-A are involved in vascular 
      calcification. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: OPG, OPN, BMP-7, and 
      fetuin-A were measured in blood samples from 602 incident dialysis patients 
      recruited from United States dialysis centers between 1995 and 1998 as part of the 
      Choices for Healthy Outcomes In Caring for ESRD Study. Their association with 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards 
      models adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidity, serum phosphate, and 
      calcium. An interaction with diabetes was tested because of its known association 
      with vascular calcification. Predictive accuracy of selected biomarkers was explored 
      by C-statistics in nested models with training and validation subcohorts. RESULTS: 
      Higher OPG and lower fetuin-A levels were associated with higher mortality over up 
      to 13 years of follow-up (median, 3.4 years). The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for 
      highest versus lowest tertile were 1.49 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.08 to 
      2.06) for OPG and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.92) for fetuin-A. In stratified models, 
      the highest tertile of OPG was associated with higher mortality among patients 
      without diabetes (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.35 to 4.34), but not patients with diabetes 
      (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.93; P for interaction=0.001). In terms of 
      cardiovascular mortality, higher fetuin-A was associated with lower risk (HR, 0.85 
      per 0.1 g/L: 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96). In patients without diabetes, higher OPG was 
      associated with greater risk (HR for highest versus lowest tertile, 2.91; 95% CI, 
      1.06 to 7.99), but not in patients with diabetes or overall. OPN and BMP-7 were not 
      independently associated with outcomes overall. The addition of OPG and fetuin-A did 
      not significantly improve predictive accuracy of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: OPG and 
      fetuin-A may be risk factors for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients 
      undergoing dialysis, but do not improve risk prediction.

      disease patients: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 162-169
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz204 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulphate (NaTS) is mostly used in haemodialysis (HD) patients 
      with calcific uraemic arteriolopathy. This double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study assessed the effect of NaTS on progression of 
      cardiovascular calcifications in HD patients. METHODS: From 65 screened patients, we 
      recruited 60 patients with an abdominal aorta Agatston calcification score ≥100. 
      Thirty patients were randomized to receive NaTS 25 g/1.73 m2 and 30 patients to 
      receive 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously during the last 15 min of HD 
      over a period of 6 months. The primary endpoint was the absolute change of the 
      abdominal aortic calcification score. RESULTS: The abdominal aortic calcification 
      score and calcification volume of the abdominal aorta increased similarly in both 
      treatment groups during the trial. As compared with the saline group, patients 
      receiving NaTS exhibited a reduction of their iliac artery calcification score 
      (-137 ± 641 versus 245  ± 755; P = 0.049), reduced pulse wave velocity (9.6  ± 2.7 
      versus 11.4 ± 3.6; P = 0.000) and a lower carotid intima-media thickness 
      (0.77  ± 0.1 versus 0.83  ±  00.17; P = 0.033) and had better preservation of 
      echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy. No patient of the NaTS 
      group developed new cardiac valve calcifications during the trial as compared with 8 
      of 29 patients in the saline group. By univariate analysis, NaTS therapy was the 
      only predictor of not developing new valvular calcifications. No adverse events 
      possibly related to NaTS infusion were noted. CONCLUSIONS: While NaTS failed to 
      retard abdominal aortic calcification progress, it positively affected calcification 
      progress in iliac arteries and heart valves as well as several other cardiovascular 
      functional parameters.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and the Risk of Cardiovascular and All-Cause 
      Mortality in the General Population: The PREVEND Study.
PG  - 1942-1951
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.120.314187 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification contributes to the cause of cardiovascular 
      disease. The calciprotein particle maturation time (T(50)) in serum, a measure of 
      calcification propensity, has been linked with adverse outcomes in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, but its role in the general population is unclear. We 
      investigated whether serum T(50) is associated with cardiovascular mortality in a 
      large general population-based cohort. Approach and Results: The relationship 
      between serum T(50) and cardiovascular mortality was studied in 6231 participants of 
      the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease) cohort. All-cause 
      mortality was the secondary outcome. Mean (±SD) age was 53±12 years, 50% were male, 
      and mean serum T(50) was 329±58 minutes. A shorter serum T(50) is indicative of a 
      higher calcification propensity. Serum T(50) was inversely associated with 
      circulating phosphate, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and alcohol 
      consumption, whereas plasma magnesium was positively associated with serum T(50) 
      (P<0.001, total multivariable model R(2)=0.281). During median (interquartile range) 
      follow-up for 8.3 (7.8-8.9) years, 364 patients died (5.8%), of whom 95 (26.1%) died 
      from a cardiovascular cause. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, each 
      60 minutes decrease in serum T(50) was independently associated with a higher risk 
      of cardiovascular mortality (fully adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.22 [1.04-1.36], 
      P=0.021). This association was modified by diabetes mellitus; stratified analysis 
      indicated a more pronounced association in individuals with diabetes mellitus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum T(50) is independently associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality in the general population and thus may be an early and 
      potentially modifiable risk marker for cardiovascular mortality.

TI  - Effect of spironolactone on the progression of coronary calcification in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 345-355
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is evidence that aldosterone plays a role in the pathogenesis of 
      vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
      spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, on the progression of 
      coronary calcification (CC) in peritoneal dialysis patients and to identify the 
      factors involved in this progression. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with a coronary 
      calcium score (CCS) ≥ 30, detected through multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) 
      and expressed in Agatston units, were randomly assigned to a group receiving 25mg 
      spironolactone per day for 12 months (spironolactone group) and a control group not 
      receiving this drug. The primary outcome was a percentage change in CCS from 
      baseline to end of the study (relative progression), when a further MDCT was 
      conducted. Patients who had progression of CC were compared with those who did not 
      progress. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, seven in the spironolactone group and nine in 
      the control group, concluded the study. The relative progression of the CCS was 
      similar in both groups, 17.2% and 27.5% in the spironolactone and control groups 
      respectively. Fifty-seven percent of the treated patients and 67% of those in the 
      control group presented progression in the CC scores (p = 0.697). Progressor 
      patients differed from non-progressors because they presented higher levels of 
      calcium and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower levels of albumin. 
      CONCLUSION: In peritoneal dialysis patients, spironolactone did not attenuate the 
      progression of CC. However, large-scale studies are needed to confirm this 
      observation. Disorders of mineral metabolism and dyslipidemia are involved in the 
      progression of CC.

TI  - Mid-term Clinical Outcomes of Immediate Protamine Use Following Elective 
      Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.
PG  - 865-871
LID - 10.1536/ihj.20-126 [doi]
AB  - Bleeding complication has been considered as a serious problem in current 
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Fortunately, several groups have already 
      reported the effectiveness of protamine use just after PCI to immediately remove any 
      arterial sheath. However, there is a concern that protamine reversal may increase 
      non-occlusive thrombus and, in turn, lead to mid-term cardiovascular events such as 
      target vessel revascularization (TVR) or stent thrombosis. Thus, the purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate whether protamine use following elective PCI was associated 
      with mid-term clinical outcomes. In total, 472 patients were included in this study; 
      subsequently, they were divided into protamine group (n = 142) and non-protamine 
      group (n = 330). The primary endpoint was the composite of ischemia-driven TVR and 
      stent thrombosis. The median follow-up period was determined to be at 562 days. In 
      total, 32 primary endpoints were observed during the study period, and the incidence 
      of primary endpoints tended to be greater in the protamine group than in the 
      non-protamine group (P = 0.056). However, the lesion length, the degree of 
      calcification, and the prevalence of hemodialysis were significantly determined 
      greater in the protamine group than in the non-protamine group. In the multivariate 
      Cox proportional hazards model, the use of protamine (versus non-protamine: hazard 
      ratio 0.542 and 95% confidence interval 0.217-1.355, P = 0.191) was deemed not to be 
      associated with the primary endpoint after controlling legion length, calcification, 
      and hemodialysis. In conclusion, immediate protamine use following elective PCI did 
      not increase mid-term ischemia-driven TVR or stent thrombosis. However, immediate 
      protamine use after PCI should be discussed further for the safety of the patient.

LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2019.1650065 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study evaluated associations of serum matrix Gla protein (MGP), 
      plasma vitamin K1, and plasma vitamin K2 with coronary artery calcium score (CACS) 
      and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. 
      Methods: Subjects comprised 112 MHD patients aged 30-60 years and 40 age-matched 
      healthy subjects. Total MGP, vitamin K1, vitamin K2, and lipid profile were examined 
      in all subjects; other clinical data, medication use, and CACS were assessed only in 
      MHD patients. Determinants of MGP in all subjects were identified by regression 
      analysis. Factors associated with CACS and CVD in MHD patients were identified by 
      regression analysis and logistic analysis, respectively. Results: Lower plasma 
      levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides [0.39 (0.24-0.70) vs. 0.77 
      (0.48-1.34) ng/mg, p < 0.001], higher frequency of plasma vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml 
      (p = 0.23), and higher serum total MGP (288.4 ± 44.2 vs. 159.7 ± 40.6 ng/ml, 
      p < 0.0001) were observed in MHD patients than in healthy controls. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with levels of vitamin K1 corrected for triglycerides 
      (p <0 .001) and vitamin K2 ≤ 0.05 ng/ml (p < 0.05) in all subjects. Total MGP level 
      was significantly associated with presence of CVD (p <0 .05), but not CACS, in MHD 
      patients. Conclusion: The end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis is a deficiency 
      state of vitamin K. Total MGP was significantly higher in MHD patients compared to 
      healthy subjects and total MGP was associated with the presence of CVD, but not 
      CACS, in MHD patients.

TI  - Incremental effects of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in medial 
      arterial calcification: Synergistic pathways for peripheral artery disease 
      progression.
PG  - 383-394

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) separately are known to 
      facilitate the progression of medial arterial calcification (MAC) in patients with 
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD), but their combined effect on MAC and 
      associated mediators of calcification is not well studied. The association of MAC 
      and calcification inducer bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and inhibitor fetuin-A, 
      with PAD, is well known. Our aim was to investigate the association of MAC with 
      alterations in BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein expression in patients with PAD with DM 
      and/or CKD. Peripheral artery plaques (50) collected during directional atherectomy 
      from symptomatic patients with PAD were evaluated, grouped into no-DM/no-CKD (n = 
      14), DM alone (n = 10), CKD alone (n = 12), and DM+CKD (n = 14). MAC density was 
      evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, and alizarin red stain. Analysis of 
      inflammation, neovascularization, BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein density was performed 
      by immunohistochemistry. MAC density, inflammation grade and neovessel content were 
      significantly higher in DM+CKD versus no-DM/no-CKD and CKD (p < 0.01). BMP-2 protein 
      density was significantly higher in DM+CKD versus all other groups (p < 0.01), 
      whereas fetuin-A protein density was significantly lower in DM+CKD versus all other 
      groups (p < 0.001). The combined presence of DM+CKD may be associated with MAC 
      severity in PAD plaques more so than DM or CKD alone, as illustrated in this study, 
      where levels of calcification mediators BMP-2 and fetuin-A protein were related most 
      robustly to DM+CKD. Further understanding of mechanisms involved in mediating 
      calcification and their association with DM and CKD may be useful in improving 
      management and developing therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Coronary artery calcification is an acceptable tool for cardiovascular risk 
      assessment in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. We aimed to identify the 
      association and predictive value of components of blood cell parameters with 
      coronary and thoracic aorta vascular calcification (VC) in ESRD population on 
      dialysis. All ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis aged 
      between 18 and 60 years were included in the study. Exclusion criteria comprised 
      patients with active infection or inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, 
      congestive heart failure, angina pectoris and/or documented coronary artery disease, 
      thyroid disease, and hepatic dysfunction. Agatston scoring was used for the 
      evaluation of coronary aorta calcification (CAC) score (CACS) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification (TAC) score (TACS). Compared to participants with no VC, those who had 
      VC were statistically significantly older (P <0.001) and had higher 
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P = 
      0.02 and <0.001, respectively). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
      increasing age (P = 0.00) and higher PLR (P = 0.04) were associated with an 
      increased likelihood of exhibiting VC (CAC or TAC). There was a positive correlation 
      between CACS and age (rs = 0.495, P = 0.00). A statistically significant positive 
      correlation existed between TACS and age (rs = 0.516, P = 0.00). Similarly, a 
      positive correlation was found between NLR, PLR, and TACS (rs = 0.334, P = 0.001, 
      and rs = 0.438, P = 0.00, respectively). On multivariate linear regression analysis, 
      increased age and red cell distribution width were found to be significant 
      predictors of log(n) TACS. PLR of 135 gave a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 
      50% for predicting VC. Being a cost-effective and easily available investigation, 
      the utilization of the correlation of NLR and PLR with CAC and TAC appears 
      promising, particularly in the age group of 30-60 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of cardiac events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients are predicted by coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      independently. It is not clear to what extent low bone mineral density (BMD) is 
      associated with higher risk of CAC and if sex interacts. We investigated the 
      sex-specific associations of CAC score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with 
      BMD of different skeletal sub-regions. METHODS: In 174 ESRD patients, median age 57 
      (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63% males, BMD (measured by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac CT) and circulating 
      inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 104 (60%) patients with 
      CAC > 100 AUs were older, had higher prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, 
      higher level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, 
      interleukin-6 and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower 
      tBMD and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients. Female 
      patients with high CAC (> 100 AUs) had significantly decreased T-score of tBMD, and 
      lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC (≤ 100 AUs); elevated CAC score were 
      associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no 
      such differences was observed in males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) 
      analysis adjusted for age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher 
      CAC score (1057 AUs) was predicted by either per SD (0.13 g/cm(2)) lower tBMD or per 
      SD (0.17 g/cm(2)) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found in male ESRD 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In female, but not male, lower BMD, in particular sub-regions 
      of legs, was associated with higher CAC score independently. Low BMD has the 
      potential to identify increased risk for high CAC score in ESRD patients.

AB  - Vascular calcification and cardiomegaly are highly prevalent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. However, the association of the combination of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) with clinical outcomes in 
      patients with CKD is not well investigated. This study investigated whether the 
      combination of AoAC and CTR is associated with poor clinical outcomes in CKD stages 
      3-5 patients. We enrolled 568 CKD patients, and AoAC and CTR were determined by 
      chest radiography at enrollment. Rapid renal progression was defined as estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2) per year. Both 
      AoAC score and CTR were significantly associated with rapid renal progression. High 
      CTR was correlated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. We stratified 
      the patients into four groups according to the median AoAC score of 4 and CTR of 
      50%. Those with AoAC ≥ 4 and CTR ≥ 50% (vs. AoAC score < 4 and CTR < 50%) were 
      associated with eGFR decline over 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year and cardiovascular 
      mortality. AoAC and CTR were independently associated with eGFR slope. In 
      conclusion, the combination of increased AoAC and cardiomegaly was associated with 
      rapid renal progression and increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD 
      stage 3-5 patients. We suggest that evaluating AoAC and CTR on chest plain 
      radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method for detecting CKD patients at 
      high risk for adverse clinical outcomes.

      kidney disease.

AB  - The role of renal excretion of Pi in relation to vascular calcification (VC) in 
      patients in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. Thus, 
      we determine the relation between fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) and VC, 
      measured using two methods in a cross-sectional study of patients with stage 3 CKD. 
      We recorded demographic data, anthropometry, comorbidities and active treatment. We 
      measured 24-hour urine FEP and, in serum, measured fibroblast growth factor 23 
      (FGF23), α-Klotho, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus. VC was 
      measured by lateral abdominal radiography (Kauppila index (KI)) and CT of the 
      abdominal aorta (measured in Agatston units). In 57% of subjects, abnormal VC was 
      present when measured using CT, and in only 17% using lateral abdominal radiography. 
      Factors associated with VC using CT were age, cardiovascular risk factors, vascular 
      comorbidity, microalbuminuria and levels of FGF23, phosphorus and calcium x 
      phosphorus product (CaxP); although only age (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.41), smoking 
      (OR 21.2, CI 4.4 to 100) and CaxP (OR 1.21, CI 1.06 to 1.37) maintained the 
      association in a multivariate analysis. By contrast, only age (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07 
      to 1.74), CaxP (OR 1.14, CI 1.13 to 1.92) and FEP (OR 1.07,95% CI 1004 to 1.14) were 
      associated with abnormal VC in the lateral abdominal radiography. In conclusion, in 
      patients with stage 3 CKD, the detection of VC by abdominal CT is more sensitive 
      than conventional X-rays. Moreover, CaxP is associated with cardiovascular risk 
      factors and vascular comorbidity; quantification of FEPi in these patients provides 
      additional clinical information in advanced VC detected by KI.

TI  - Evaluation of the coronary circulation and calcification in children on regular 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 1941-1951
LID - 10.1007/s00467-017-3678-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the coronary circulation and 
      calcification in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. 
      METHODS: A total of 50 children with ESRD and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in 
      the study. Cardiac functions and coronary blood flow were evaluated with 
      conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. Coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) was evaluated using high-resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT). 
      RESULTS: The hyperemic coronary flow volume (CFV) and coronary flow reserve were 
      significantly lower in the patient group than in the controls, while there was no 
      significant difference in the baseline CFV between the two groups. Hypertension was 
      present in 60% and CAC was observed in 20% of the children in the patient group. CAC 
      was present in 30% of the children in the hypertensive subgroup. The left ventricle 
      myocardial performance index (LV MPI), CAC score, duration of hypertension and level 
      of diastolic blood pressure were independent predictors of the coronary blood flow, 
      and LV MPI, serum parathyroid hormone, duration of dialysis and E'/A' mitral valve 
      were independent predictors of coronary calcification. CONCLUSION: High diastolic 
      blood pressure, long duration of hypertension, high LV MPI and increased CAC scores 
      are independent risk factors for impaired coronary blood flow in children with ESRD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic renal disease are susceptible to accelerated 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Micro RNAs 
      (miRNAs) have been linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in the 
      general population. AIM: This study was carried out to evaluate the link between 
      miRNA 192 and vascular calcification, pre-existing as well as newly occurring major 
      adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality among hemodialysis patients who are 
      also considered to be potential kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We screened 
      64 potential transplant recipients on hemodialysis at our university hospital. 
      Pre-existing overt cardiovascular disease was recorded; new adverse cardiovascular 
      events and all causes of death over an observational period of 5 years were 
      prospectively followed. Vascular calcification was measured in the aorta using 
      computerized tomography scans, and micro RNA 192 was measured. RESULTS: The final 
      study population included 55 patients followed for 63 months. Micro RNA 192 was 
      significantly lower in patients who had preexisting cardiovascular disease (P = 
      .015) as well and in all patients who had experienced any event by the end of the 
      observational period (P = .012). A multiregression analysis model including micro 
      RNA, age, dialysis vintage, intradialytic hypotension, vascular calcification, 
      diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and smoking found the only independently 
      correlating factor to cardiovascular events in this model to be micro RNA (β = 
      -0.286, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA 192 levels are significantly lower among 
      patients experiencing cardiovascular events while on hemodialysis awaiting kidney 
      transplantation.

PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0218-2 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical relevance of 
      aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients. METHODS: Between January 2010 and 
      September 2014, 1221 patients with urolithiasis were treated in Oyokyo Kidney 
      Research Institute and Hirosaki University Hospital. Among these, 287 patients 
      (Stone group) on whom adequate data were available were included in this 
      retrospective study. We also selected 148 subjects with early stage (pT1N0M0) renal 
      cell carcinoma from 607 renal cell carcinoma patients who underwent radical 
      nephrectomy at Hirosaki University Hospital (Non-stone group) as control subjects. 
      Validity of the Non-stone group was evaluated by comparison with pair-matched 296 
      volunteers from 1166 subjects who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project 
      in 2014. Thereafter, age, body mass index, aortic calcification index (ACI), renal 
      function, serum uric acid concentrations, and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, 
      or cardiovascular disease) were compared between the Non-stone and Stone groups. 
      Independent factors for higher ACI and impaired renal function were assessed using 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed relevance of 
      Non-stone group patients as a control subject by comparing the pair-matched 
      community-dwelling volunteers. Backgrounds of patients between the Non-stone and 
      Stone groups were not significantly different except for the presence of 
      hypertension in the Stone group. ACI was not significantly high in the Stone group 
      compared with the Non-stone group. However, age-adjusted ACI was greater in the 
      Stone group than the Non-stone group. Among urolithiasis patients, ACI was 
      significantly higher in uric acid containing stone patients. The number of patients 
      with stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in the Stone 
      group than in the Non-stone group (12% vs. 4%, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis showed higher aortic calcification index (>13%), and being a 
      stone former were independent factors for stage 3B CKD at the time of diagnosis. 
      CONCLUSION: Aortic calcification and being a stone former had harmful influence on 
      renal function. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN: UMIN000022962.

TI  - Osteocalcin (bone GLA protein) levels, vascular calcifications, vertebral fractures 
      and mortality in hemodialysis patients with diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 635-643
LID - 10.1007/s40620-019-00595-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is recognized as one of the major causes of 
      end stage kidney disease. Bone Gla protein (BGP) is a vitamin K-dependent protein 
      involved in bone mineralization and vascular calcifications (VC). Our goal was to 
      characterize BGP and undercarboxylated BGP (ucBGP) in DM patients on HD, compared to 
      HD patients without DM, and their association with vascular and bone disease. 
      METHODS: 387 HD patients from 18 dialysis centers in Italy. Associations of DM, 
      levels of BGP, vitamin D and VC were evaluated. Time-to-event analysis for all-cause 
      mortality was performed by the Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: Patients with DM had lower 
      levels of total BGP (139.00 vs. 202.50 mcg/L, p < 0.001), 25(OH)D (23.4 vs. 
      30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and ucBGP (9.24 vs. 11.32 mcg/L, p = 0.022). In regression 
      models, the geometric means of total BGP and ucBGP were 19% (p = 0.009) and 26% 
      (p = 0.034) lower in diabetic patients. In univariate Cox regression analysis, DM 
      patients had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR:1.83, 95% CI 1.13-2.96, 
      p = 0.014). Adjustment for confounders confirmed the significant DM-mortality link. 
      We included VC and warfarin into the Cox model, the DM-mortality link was no longer 
      significant, suggesting a role of these risk factors as causal mediators leading to 
      increased mortality in dialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients have an increased 
      mortality risk associated with DM. Furthermore, we found an association between DM 
      and decreased BGP levels. Although our study does not support the notion that BGP 
      levels act as mediator in the DM-mortality link, to our knowledge this is the first 
      study in HD patients suggesting a potential protective role of BGP in the bone, 
      endocrine and vascular pathway.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Altered Circulating Micro RNA -125b and Their 
      Influences on Uremic Vascular Calcification Among Patients With End-Stage Renal 
      Disease.
PG  - e010805
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.010805 [doi]
LID - e010805
AB  - Background Micro RNA -125b (miR-125b) has been shown to regulate vascular 
      calcification ( VC ), and serum miR-125b levels are a potential biomarker for 
      estimating the risk of uremic VC status. However, it is unknown whether clinical 
      features, including chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder molecules, affect 
      serum miR-125b levels. Methods and Results Patients receiving chronic dialysis for 
      ≥3 months were recruited from different institutes. Serum miR-125b and chronic 
      kidney disease-mineral bone disorder effectors, including intact parathyroid 
      hormone, 25- OH -D, fibroblast growth factor-23, osteoprotegerin, and fetuin-A, were 
      quantified. We used multivariate regression analyses to identify factors associated 
      with low serum miR-125b levels and an area under receiver operating characteristic 
      curve curve to derive optimal cutoffs for factors exhibiting close associations. 
      Further regression analyses evaluated the influence of miR-125b on VC risk. Among 
      223 patients receiving chronic dialysis (mean age, 67.3 years; mean years of 
      dialysis, 5.2), 54 (24.2%) had high serum miR-125b levels. Osteoprotegerin ( 
      P=0.013), fibroblast growth factor-23 ( P=0.006), and fetuin-A ( P=0.036) were 
      linearly associated with serum miR-125b levels. High osteoprotegerin levels 
      independently correlated with high serum miR-125 levels. Adding serum miR-125b 
      levels and serum osteoprotegerin levels (≥400 pg/mL) into models estimating the risk 
      of uremic VC increased the area under receiver operating characteristic curve values 
      (for models without miR-125b/osteoprotegerin, with miR-125b, and both: 0.74, 0.79, 
      and 0.81, respectively). Conclusions Serum osteoprotegerin levels ≥400 pg/mL and 
      serum miR-125b levels synergistically increased the accuracy of estimating VC risk 
      among patients receiving chronic dialysis. Taking miR-125b and osteoprotegerin 
      levels into consideration when estimating VC risk may be recommended.

TI  - Inflammation and the bone-vascular axis in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 489-97
LID - 10.1007/s00198-015-3233-8 [doi]
AB  - Bone loss and vascular calcification coincide in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease, similar as to what is observed in the general population. In the present 
      bone biopsy study, we provide further evidence that (micro-)inflammation may 
      represent a common soil for both diseases. INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a 
      common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is predictive of 
      subsequent cardiovascular disease and mortality. Mounting evidence linking bone 
      disorders with vascular calcification has contributed to the development of the 
      concept of the bone-vascular axis. Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of 
      both disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship 
      between aortic calcification, inflammation, and bone histomorphometry in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: Parameters of inflammation and mineral metabolism were assessed 
      in 81 ESRD patients (55 ± 13 year, 68 % male) referred for renal transplantation. 
      Static bone histomorphometry parameters were determined on transiliac bone biopsies 
      performed during the transplant procedure. Aortic calcification was quantified on 
      lateral lumbar X-rays using the Kauppila method. RESULTS: Aortic calcification, low 
      bone turnover, and low bone area were observed in 53, 37, and 21 % of patients 
      respectively. Inflammatory markers were found to be independently associated with 
      aortic calcification (hsIL-6) and low bone area (TNF-α). Low bone area associated 
      with aortic calcification, independent of age, diabetes, and inflammation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Low bone area and inflammation associates with aortic calcification, 
      independent of each other and traditional risk factors. Our data emphasize the role 
      of (micro-)inflammation in the bone-vascular axis in CKD.

      Promote Vascular Calcification: A Role for GRP (Gla-Rich Protein).
PG  - 575-587
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.117.310578 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of mineral crystal formation is a crucial step in ectopic 
      calcification. Serum calciprotein particles (CPPs) have been linked to chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) calcification propensity, but additional knowledge is required 
      to understand their function, assemblage, and composition. The role of other 
      circulating nanostructures, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vascular 
      calcification is currently unknown. Here, we investigated the association of GRP 
      (Gla-rich protein) with circulating CPP and EVs and the role of CKD CPPs and EVs in 
      vascular calcification. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Biological CPPs and EVs were isolated 
      from healthy and CKD patients and comparatively characterized using ultrastructural, 
      analytic, molecular, and immuno-based techniques. Our results show that GRP is a 
      constitutive component of circulating CPPs and EVs. CKD stage 5 serum CPPs and EVs 
      are characterized by lower levels of fetuin-A and GRP, and CPPs CKD stage 5 have 
      increased mineral maturation, resembling secondary CPP particles. Vascular smooth 
      muscle cell calcification assays reveal that CPPs CKD stage 5 and EVs CKD stage 5 
      are taken up by vascular smooth muscle cells and induce vascular calcification by 
      promoting cell osteochondrogenic differentiation and inflammation. These effects 
      were rescued by incubation of CPPs CKD stage 5 with γ-carboxylated GRP. In vitro, 
      formation and maturation of basic calcium phosphate crystals was highly reduced in 
      the presence of γ-carboxylated GRP, fetuin-A, and MGP (matrix gla protein), and a 
      similar antimineralization system was identified in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Uremic CPPs 
      and EVs are important players in the mechanisms of widespread calcification in CKD. 
      We propose a major role for cGRP as inhibitory factor to prevent calcification at 
      systemic and tissue levels.

      Dialysis Patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload (FO) is frequently present in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients and is associated with markers of malnutrition, inflammation, and 
      atherosclerosis/calcification (MIAC) syndrome. We examined the relationships in 
      stable PD patients between phase angle (PhA) and the spectrum of uremic vasculopathy 
      including vascular calcification and arterial stiffness and between PhA and changes 
      in serum fetuin-A levels. METHODS: Sixty-one stable adult PD patients were evaluated 
      in a cross-sectional study (ST1). Phase angle was measured by multifrequency 
      bioimpedance analysis (InbodyS10, Biospace, Korea) at 50 kHz. Augmentation index 
      (AI), a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, was assessed by digital pulse 
      amplitude tonometry (Endo PAT, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). Vascular 
      calcification was assessed by simplified calcification score (SCS). Serum fetuin-A 
      levels were measured by ELISA (Thermo scientific; Waltham, MA, USA). Serum albumin 
      was used as a nutritional marker, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was used as an 
      inflammatory marker. The same assessments were carried out longitudinally (ST2) in 
      the first 33 patients who completed 1 year of evaluation in ST1. RESULTS: In ST1, 
      patients with PhA < 6° had higher CRP levels, AI, and SCS and lower serum albumin 
      and fetuin-A levels, in comparison with patients with PhA ≥ 6°. In addition, PhA was 
      a predictor of both AI (β = -0.351, p = 0.023) and SCS ≥ 3 (EXP (B) = 0.243, p = 
      0.005). In ST2, the increase of PhA over time was associated with decreases in both 
      AI (r = -0.378, p = 0.042) and CRP levels (r = -0.426, p = 0.021), as well as with 
      the increase in serum fetuin-A levels (r = 0.411, p = 0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Phase 
      angle predicts both arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in stable PD 
      patients.

AB  - The study aimed to provide a unique nationwide data and a valuable update on the 
      current situation of vascular calcification (VC) among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study included all patients diagnosed 
      with CKD over a period of one year and six months from September 2015 to February 
      2017 and underwent dialysis. All analyses were done using IBM-SPSS. Of the 842 
      enrolled patients, 836 (99.3%) constituted the descriptive population. The mean age 
      of patients was 51.8 ± 15.4 years. A total of 759 (90.8%) patients had 
      cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of VC in patients with CKD is 40.8%. In

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign of 
      severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. Fetuin-A and 
      osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD therapy. However, 
      there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on dialysis. The aim of 
      our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the relationship between VC and 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and independent predictors of VC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. 
      Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient group was 
      compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A plain 
      radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the evaluation of 
      VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both patients and controls 
      were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients 
      were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly 
      lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly 
      higher in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were 
      independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the following 
      factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was 
      found between patients with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, 
      and 25-OH-vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients 
      undergoing HD and is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the 
      presence of DM, and high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients 
      undergoing HD. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying 
      and the factors contributing to VC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the interaction between serum alkaline 
      phosphatase (ALP) and vascular calcification (VC) affecting cardiovascular events 
      (CVE) and mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. This study 
      investigated the combined effect of ALP and VC on prognosis in ESKD patients 
      starting dialysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 587 ESKD patients treated at a 
      single center between January 2006 and July 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. VC 
      was assessed by the aortic calcification index (ACI) using abdominal computed 
      tomography. Patients were stratified into four groups according to the median ACI 
      (17.18) and serum ALP value (108.0 U/L) as low ACI-low ALP, low ACI-high ALP, high 
      ACI-low ALP, or high ACI-high ALP. The association between ALP and VC and the 
      composite of CVE and death was analyzed. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years 
      (range, 1.5-5.6 years), 140 patients (23.8%) developed CVE and 130 deaths (22.1%) 
      occurred. In the stratified analysis, patients with high ACI-low ALP had a greater 
      risk of the composite endpoint than patients with low ACI-low ALP (adjusted hazard 
      ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-2.60; P = 0.004). Patients with high 
      ACI-high ALP had the greatest risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.77-2.72; P = 0.001). The interaction between ACI and ALP on CVE and 
      mortality was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combined effect 
      of VC and higher ALP was associated with a greater risk of CVE and death, and high 
      serum ALP amplified the risk associated with VC in ESKD patients starting dialysis.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification score and common iliac artery calcification score in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients.
PG  - 837-845
LID - 10.1111/nep.13113 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Many studies have validated Agatston's coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) for assessing vascular calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients. This study aimed to evaluate the CACS and common iliac artery 
      calcification score (IACS) and to examine the variables related to each score. 
      METHODS: The subjects were 145 non-dialysis CKD patients. The CACS and IACS were 
      determined using the same thoracicoabdominal multi-detector computed tomography. 
      Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the factors associated with 
      the CACS or IACS. The associations between progression to renal replacement therapy 
      (RRT) and the CACS or IACS were studied using Cox hazards models. RESULTS: The 
      subjects' median age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and follow-up 
      period were 72 (62-78) years, 32 (18-50) mL/min/1.73m(2) , and 864 (550-1425) days, 
      respectively. Age, diabetes, the serum phosphate level, and the eGFR were found to 
      be significant factors of the CACS [β (95% CI): 0.38 (0.02-0.04), P < 0.0001, 0.28 
      (0.19-0.50), P < 0.0001, 0.16 (0.03-0.45), P < 0.05 and -0.15 (-0.02-0.00), 
      P < 0.05, respectively]. Age and diabetes were shown to be significant factors of 
      the IACS [β (95% CI): 0.53 (0.04-0.06), P < 0.0001, and 0.18 (0.07-0.40), P < 0.01, 
      respectively]. Progression to RRT occurred in 31 patients and was significantly 
      associated with the CACS (hazard ratio: 1.01, P < 0.01), urinary protein level and 
      eGFR, but not the IACS. CONCLUSION: Chronic kidney disease related risk factors for 
      VC, such as the eGFR and hyperphosphataemia, are significantly associated with a 
      high CACS, but not a high IACS, and the CACS is a significant predictor of 
      progression to RRT.

AB  - Vascular calcifications worse outcomes in the general population and in patients on 
      dialysis. We investigated 146 patients on chronic hemodialysis and 63 healthy 
      controls with normal renal function under 65 years of age. All subjects underwent 
      B-mode ultrasonography of common and internal carotid artery, abdominal aorta, 
      common and superficial femoral artery and posterior tibial artery to assess the 
      presence of intimal and medial calcifications. Intimal and media calcifications were 
      present at the level of the carotid vessel, the abdominal aorta, the common femoral 
      artery, the superficial femoral artery and the posterior tibial artery, respectively 
      in 45%, 50%, 45%, 50%, 42% of patients on dialysis and in 5%, 15%, 24%, 5%, 2% of 
      controls (p <0,01). On multivariate logistic analysis of regression, after 
      adjustment for potential confounders, carotid intimal calcification, abdominal 
      aortic calcification, medial calcification of the superficial femoral artery and 
      posterior tibial artery calcification were associated with dialysis and with 
      cardiovascular disease. Only intimal arterial calcification were associated with 
      older age and smoking. Vascular calcifications are extremely common in middle-aged 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis. Ultrasonography currently available in Nephrology, 
      is a sensitive, reproducible, inexpensive imaging technique to identify arterial 
      intimal and medial calcification in high-risk cardiovascular subjects.

TI  - Bone turnover markers predict type of bone histomorphometry and bone mineral density 
      in Asian chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 163-171

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) are 
      well-controlled following the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, 
      the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture are still high in haemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between bone 
      turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone histomorphometry in HD 
      patients. METHODS: Twenty-two chronic HD patients were enrolled. Serum levels of 
      bone turnover markers were measured. Double tetracycline-labelled iliac crest bone 
      specimens were evaluated using specialized a computer program (Osteomeasure). The 
      types of bone histomorphometry were classified based on turnover, mineralization and 
      volume. BMD and coronary artery calcification were also determined. RESULTS: Bone 
      histomorphometry revealed osteitis fibrosa (50%), adynamic bone disease (45%) and 
      mixed uremic osteodystrophy (5%). Serum iPTH level predicted high bone turnover with 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.833 (95% 
      CI = 0.665-1.000, P = 0.008). Serum TRAP-5b also had ROC of 0.733 (95% CI = 
      0.517-0.950, P = 0.065). In addition, when using serum iPTH (cut-off 484.50 ng/mL) 
      or serum TRAP-5b (cut-off 1.91 pg./mL) to predict high turnover, the sensitivity was 
      0.917. On the other hand, when both iPTH and TRAP-5B were above these cut-off, the 
      specificity was 1.000. Low BMD and severe vascular calcification were commonly 
      identified. However, there were no significant correlations between bone biomarkers 
      and BMD or severe vascular calcification. CONCLUSION: Although iPTH levels were 
      close to the target of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guideline, 
      abnormal bone histomorphometry, BMD, and severe vascular calcification are still 
      common. Bone biopsy is still crucially required as an accurate diagnostic tool in 
      providing optimal guide for the treatment. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) 
      have high cardiovascular risk. Both conditions are related to systemic 
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. The prevalence and severity of coronary 
      artery calcification (CaC) is higher in patients with DM, regardless of their renal 
      function. Data about the long-term prognostic role of CaC in diabetic patients with 
      CKD are scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a prospective longitudinal 
      study enrolling 137 patients with advanced CKD. A non-enhanced multislice coronary 
      computed tomography (CT) was performed at baseline. CaC was assessed using Agatston 
      method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC score: severe calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400HU) and mild-moderate calcification group (CaCs<400HU). RESULTS: The 
      median follow-up time was 87.5 months. DM was found in 28% of subjects. The patients 
      with DM showed more severe CaC, lower albumin and higher C-reactive protein serum 
      levels. Serum albumin was correlated with severe CaC (r=-0.45, P=.009). Overall 
      mortality rate reached 58%. Patients with DM also tended to have higher mortality 
      compared to non-diabetic subjects (X(2) 3.51, P=.061) especially those with severe 
      CaC showed higher mortality than those with severe CaC without DM (93% vs.73%, 
      P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CKD and DM have more severe CaC, 
      increased inflammation-malnutrition data and higher mortality compared to those 
      without DM.

LID - 188
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit higher 
      prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CaC) than general population. CaC has 
      been proposed as a risk factor for mortality in end-stage CKD, but most studies in 
      the field are based on short-term follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a cohort, 10-year 
      prospective longitudinal study of consecutive cases referred to the renal unit. A 
      non-enhanced multislice coronary computed tomography was performed at baseline. CaC 
      was assessed by Agatston method. Patients were stratified according to their CaC 
      score: severe calcification group (CaCs< 400 HU) and mild-moderate calcification 
      group (CaCs≥400 HU). The overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality, CV events, and 
      factors potentially associated with CaC development were recorded. RESULTS: 137 
      patients with advanced CKD were enrolled and provided consent. Overall mortality 
      rate was 58%; 40% due to CV events. The rate of overall mortality in the severe 
      calcification group was 75%, and 30% in the low calcification group, whereas the 
      rate of CV mortality was 35% vs. 6%, respectively (p < 0.001). The severe 
      calcification group was older, had higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
      former cardiologic events, and lower albumin serum levels than the mild-moderate 
      calcification group. In a multivariate Cox model, severe CaC was a significant 
      predictor of CV mortality (HR 5.01; 95%CI 1.28 to 19.6, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Among advanced CKD, there was a significantly increase of CV mortality in patients 
      with severe CaCs during a 10-year follow-up period. CaCs could be a useful 
      prognostic tool to predict CV mortality risk in CKD patients.

TI  - Effects of oral activated charcoal on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification 
      in Chinese patients with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 265-272
LID - 10.1007/s40620-018-00571-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between oral activated charcoal (OAC) and 
      hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification is not completely clear. We observed 
      and recorded the effects of OAC on hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in 
      stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 
      we included 97 patients with stage 3-4 CKD. In the first phase of the experiment, 
      the patients were randomly divided into the OAC group and placebo group. The 
      endpoint of this phase was the development of hyperphosphatemia. The patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia were selected into the second phase of the study. These patients 
      underwent coronary artery multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and were randomly 
      divided into three groups: the OAC group, the calcium carbonate (CC) group and the 
      lanthanum carbonate (LC) group. RESULTS: The first and second phases of the 
      experiment were followed for 12 months. In the first phase of the experiment, there 
      was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with 
      hyperphosphatemia between the OAC and placebo groups (28.57% vs. 79.17%, 
      X(2) = 24.958, P = 0.000). In the second phase, the differences in coronary 
      calcification score (CACS) between the OAC group, the CC group and the LC group were 
      statistically significant (525.5 ± 104.2 vs 688.1 ± 183.7 vs 431.4 ± 122.5, 
      P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Oral activated charcoal effectively delays the onset of 
      hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. OAC appears to delay the 
      development of vascular calcifications in stage 3-4 CKD patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several histologic features have been identified in the 
      upper-extremity arteries and veins of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, 
      which may affect arteriovenous fistula maturation. However, it is unclear whether 
      these chronic kidney disease vascular features are abnormal. METHODS: We obtained 
      upper-extremity arterial and venous specimens from 125 advanced chronic kidney 
      disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula creation and from 15 control 
      subjects. We quantified medial fibrosis, micro-calcification, and intimal 
      hyperplasia with appropriate histology stains. We characterized medial collagen 
      fiber configuration in second-harmonic-generation microscopy images for the fiber 
      anisotropy index and the dominant fiber direction. RESULTS: The advanced chronic 
      kidney disease patients were significantly younger than control subjects 
      (53 ± 14 years vs 76 ± 11 years, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, the chronic 
      kidney disease patients had greater arterial medial fibrosis (69% ± 14% vs 
      51% ± 10%, p < 0.001) and greater arterial micro-calcification (3.03% ± 5.17% vs 
      0.01% ± 0.03%, p = 0.02), but less arterial intimal thickness (30 ± 25 µm vs 
      63 ± 25 µm, p < 0.001), as compared to control subjects. The anisotropy index of 
      medial collagen fibers was lower in both arteries (0.24 ± 0.10 vs 0.44 ± 0.04, 
      p < 0.001) and veins (0.28 ± 0.09 vs 0.53 ± 0.10, p < 0.001) in chronic kidney 
      disease patients, indicating that orientation of the fibers was more disordered. The 
      dominant direction of medial collagen fibers in chronic kidney disease patients was 
      greater in the arteries (49.3° ± 23.6° vs 4.0° ± 2.0°, p < 0.001) and the veins 
      (30.0° ± 19.6° vs 3.9° ± 2.1°, p < 0.001), indicating that the fibers in general 
      were aligned more perpendicular to the lumen. CONCLUSION: Advanced chronic kidney 
      disease is associated with several abnormalities in vascular histology and collagen 
      fiber configuration. Future research is needed to investigate whether these 
      abnormalities affect the maturation outcomes of arteriovenous fistulas.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death 
      mainly due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Early risk identification may allow 
      interventions and prevention of fatal events. OBJECTIVES: The study aim was to 
      assess the usefulness of selected CVD biomarkers as predictors of 5-year mortality 
      in patients with different CKD stages. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study included 57 CKD 
      patients: 38 in stage 5 (ESRD), 19 in stage 3 and 4 (CKD3-4), and 19 healthy 
      controls. Blood samples were obtained once to measure fetuin A, adiponectin, leptin, 
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), 
      intracellular-1 (ICAM1) and vascular-1 (VCAM1) adhesion molecules (ELISA or Luminex 
      platform). Computed tomography was performed to assess the calcium score (CS). 
      Patients were prospectively followed for 5 years to evaluate their all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: Serum VCAM1, TNF and IL-6 were significantly higher in more 
      advanced CKD stages. VCAM1 correlated significantly with ICAM1, TNF and IL-6. TNF 
      and IL-6 were also significantly correlated with each other. No significant changes 
      were detected for other markers. IL-6 correlated significantly with CS, age, renal 
      function and CRP. Elevated CS and IL-6 increased over 3 times the 5-year all-cause 
      and cardiovascular mortality risks in patients with CKD or ESRD at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and CS were significantly associated with 5-year risk of all-cause 
      mortality in CKD patients. Our study suggests an involvement of chronic inflammation 
      linked to coronary artery calcification that is likely to contribute to the 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with impaired renal function.

AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification (VC) and 
      requires carboxylation by vitamin K to exert calcification inhibition. Chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients undergo early vascular aging often involving extensive 
      VC. The present cross-sectional study investigated the association between 
      circulating dp-ucMGP levels, MGP expression in vascular tissue and MGP 
      polymorphisms. In 141 CKD stage 5 patients, CAC score was significantly increased in 
      the highest tertile of dp-ucMGP (p = 0.002), and a high medial VC score was 
      associated with elevated dp-ucMGP levels. MGP vascular expression was associated 
      with increased circulating dp-ucMGP and CAC scores. MGP SNP analysis revealed that 
      patients homozygous for the C allele of the rs1800801 variant had a higher CAC score 
      (median 15 [range 0-1312]) compared to patients carrying a T allele (median 0 [range 
      0-966] AU). These results indicate that plasma levels of dp-ucMGP are an independent 
      predictor of increased VC in CKD5 patients and correlate with both higher CAC scores 
      and degree of medial calcification. Additionally, high vascular expression of MGP 
      was associated with higher CAC scores and plasma dp-ucMGP levels. Taken together, 
      our results support that MGP is involved in the pathogenesis of VC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high prevalence 
      of classical coronary risk factors, there is increasing evidence that 
      atherosclerosis is different in renal compared to nonrenal patients. Therefore, the 
      present study compares changes in different vessels obtained at cardiac surgery 
      between patients with early and advanced CKD and nonrenal control patients. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Fifty patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery were divided into 
      three groups: (i) 24 control patients with creatinine <1.3mg/dl, (ii) 14 patients 
      with early CKD (creatinine 1.3-2.0mg/dl), and (iii) 12 patients with advanced CKD 
      (creatinine >2.0mg/dl). Aorta, arteria mammaria interna, and vena saphena (V. 
      saphena) were analyzed using morphometry, Kossa stain for vascular calcification, 
      and immunohistochemistry for markers of inflammation and proosteogenic 
      differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Thereby, aortic wall 
      thickness and calcification score of aortic intima and of V. saphena were 
      significantly higher in advanced CKD patients than in nonrenal control patients, 
      whereas significant vascular inflammation and proosteogenic dedifferentiation of 
      VSMC and calcification of the aortic media were already present in early CKD. 
      Interestingly, marked calcification of the V. saphena magna was seen in advanced 
      CKD. Of note, calcium-phosphate product correlated well with markers of 
      inflammation, but not with calcification itself. CONCLUSIONS: Early stages of CKD 
      are already associated with local up-regulation of proinflammatory and proosteogenic 
      molecules in the vascular wall and calcification of the aortic media. These findings 
      point to the importance of local microinflammation in CKD and may shed new light on 
      the potentially overestimated role of the calcium-phosphate product for vessel 
      calcification.

TI  - Inverse J-shaped relation between coronary arterial calcium density and mortality in 
      advanced chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1202-1211
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy352 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score from cardiac computed tomography 
      (CT) is a composite of CAC volume and CAC density. In the general population, CAC 
      volume is positively and CAC density inversely associated with cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) events, implying that decreased CAC density reflects atherosclerotic 
      plaque instability. We analysed associations of CAC indices with mortality risk in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease [chronic kidney disease Stage 5 (CKD5)]. 
      METHODS: In 296 CKD5 patients undergoing cardiac CT (median age 55 years, 67% male, 
      19% diabetes, 133 dialysed), the Framingham risk score (FRS), presence of CVD and 
      protein-energy wasting (PEW; subjective global assessment) and high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined at baseline. 
      During follow-up for a median of 35 months, 51 patients died and 75 patients 
      underwent renal transplantation. All-cause mortality risk was analysed with 
      competing-risk regression models. Vascular calcification was analysed in biopsies of 
      the arteria epigastrica inferior in 111 patients. RESULTS: Patients in the middle 
      tertile of CAC density had the highest CAC score, CAC volume, age, CVD, PEW, FRS, 
      hsCRP and IL-6. In competing risk analysis, the middle {subhazard ratio [sHR] 10.7 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-57.3]} and high [sHR 8.9 (95% CI 1.5-51.8)] 
      tertiles of CAC density associated with increased mortality, independent of CAC 
      volume. The high tertile of CAC volume, independent of CAC density, associated with 
      increased mortality [sHR 8.9 (95% CI 1.5-51.8)]. Arterial media calcification was 
      prominent and associated with CAC volume and CAC density. CONCLUSIONS: In CKD5, 
      mortality increased linearly with higher CAC score and CAC volume whereas for CAC 
      density an inverse J-shaped pattern was observed, with the crude mortality rate 
      being highest for the middle tertile of CAC density. CAC volume and CAC density were 
      associated with the extent of arterial media calcification.

TI  - Calciphylaxis-Associated Cutaneous Vascular Calcification in Noncalciphylaxis 
      Patients.
PG  - 557-563
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000001519 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a highly morbid disease that is strongly associated with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD); however, the histologic criteria for diagnosis have not been 
      well established nor have their specificity for calciphylaxis been determined. This 
      retrospective study aimed to examine the prevalence of histologic features commonly 
      associated with calciphylaxis in noncalciphylaxis patients. We also sought to 
      evaluate whether these features may be more prevalent in patients with CKD. To 
      assess this, healthy marginal skin tissue from above-the-knee amputation specimens 
      was compared between patients with CKD (n = 23) and without CKD (n = 47). 
      Intravascular calcification of capillaries or small-to-medium arterioles was 
      detected on von Kossa stain in 40.0% of the entire cohort. Capillary calcification 
      and intravascular thrombosis were more prevalent in patients with CKD. Finely 
      stippled capillary calcification was present in 26.1% of patients with CKD versus 
      8.5% of patients without CKD (P = 0.0484), and intravascular thrombosis was present 
      in 8.7% of patients with CKD and 0.0% of patients without CKD (P = 0.0403). None of 
      the patients in this study had clinical evidence of calciphylaxis at presentation 
      and in at least a 1-year follow-up period. This study confirms that the histologic 
      features previously associated with calciphylaxis are nonspecific and are more 
      prevalent in patients with CKD.

TI  - Histopathology of Calciphylaxis: Cohort Study With Clinical Correlations.
PG  - 795-802
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0000000000000824 [doi]
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare, painful, and life-threatening condition with a high 
      mortality rate. Although the etiology of calciphylaxis is not well understood, it 
      has been proposed that calcium deposition within and around subcutaneous vessels 
      restricts blood flow chronically, thereby predisposing the patient to acute 
      pannicular and dermal thrombosis. Given increasing recognition of the role of 
      hypercoagulability in calciphylaxis, this retrospective cohort study sought to 
      evaluate the presence of thromboses and dermal angioplasia in calciphylaxis. 
      Moreover, we aimed to validate previous observations about the histopathology of 
      calciphylaxis compared with skin biopsies from patients with end-stage renal disease 
      but without calciphylaxis. After a meticulous clinical chart review, we assessed the 
      corresponding skin biopsies for the presence of vessel calcification, thromboses, 
      and dermal angioplasia in skin biopsies from patients with calciphylaxis (n = 57) 
      and compared with those from patients with end-stage renal disease but without 
      calciphylaxis (n = 26). Histopathologic findings were correlated with clinical 
      features such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or associated malignancy. Our 
      results validated a prior observation that calciphylaxis was significantly more 
      likely to show calcification of dermal vessels and diffuse dermal thrombi. This 
      study reports the frequent finding of dermal angioplasia, a potential marker of 
      chronic low-grade ischemia, as another frequent microscopic finding in 
      calciphylaxis. Among cases of calciphylaxis, histopathologic changes in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease were indistinguishable from those in patients without 
      chronic kidney disease, thereby implying a final common pathogenic pathway in both 
      uremic and nonuremic calciphylaxis. In future, larger, prospective studies may be 
      useful in validating these findings.

TI  - Associations of Serum Calciprotein Particle Size and Transformation Time With 
      Arterial Calcification, Arterial Stiffness, and Mortality in Incident Hemodialysis 
      Patients.

LID - S0272-6386(20)30889-1 [pii]

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Characteristics of the transformation of primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles (CPPs) in serum, including the size of secondary CPP (CPP2) 
      aggregates and the time of transformation (T(50)), may be markers for arterial 
      calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We examined the associations 
      of CPP2 aggregate size and T(50) with arterial calcification in incident HD 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Incident 
      HD patients (n=402with available CPP2 measures and n=388with available T(50) 
      measures) from the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End-Stage 
      Renal Disease (PACE) Study PREDICTORS: Serum CPP2 size and T(50) at baseline. 
      OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes were baseline coronary artery and thoracic aorta 
      calcifications. Exploratory outcomes included baseline arterial stiffness, measured 
      by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ankle brachial index, and longitudinally, repeat 
      measures of PWV and all-cause mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Tobit regression, 
      multiple linear regression, Poisson regression, linear mixed-effects regression, and 
      Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 55±13 years, 41% were 
      women, 71% were Black, and 57% had diabetes mellitus. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) 
      were correlated with baseline fetuin A level (r=-0.59 for CPP2 and 0.44 for T(50); 
      P<0.001 for both), but neither was associated with baseline measures of arterial 
      calcification or arterial stiffness. Baseline CPP2 size and T(50) were not 
      associated with repeat measures of PWV. During a median follow-up of 3.5 (IQR, 
      1.7-6.2) years, larger CPP2 was associated with higher risk for mortality (HR, 1.17 
      [95% CI, 1.05-1.31] per 100nm larger CPP2 size) after adjusting for demographics and 
      comorbid conditions, but there was no association between baseline T(50) and risk 
      for mortality. LIMITATIONS: Possible imprecision in assays, small sample size, 
      limited generalizability to incident HD populations with different racial 
      composition, and residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: In incident HD patients, neither 
      CPP2 size nor T(50) was associated with prevalent arterial calcification and 
      stiffness. Larger CPP2 was associated with risk for mortality, but this finding 
      needs to be confirmed in future studies.

TI  - Association of abdominal aortic calcification estimated by plain radiography with 
      outcomes in haemodialysis patients: A 6-year follow-up study.
PG  - 559-565

AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) 
      patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD 
      patients. METHODS: Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal 
      aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 
      was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two 
      groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS < 5) and moderate to severe 
      calcification group (AACS ≥ 5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of 
      the study (30 November 2016). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this 
      study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42 ± 13.48 years. 
      Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to 
      severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02-1.10), P = 0.003), 
      longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00-1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 
      3.01 (1.18-7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels 
      (OR 2.83 (1.01-7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 
      22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe 
      calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) 
      and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor 
      calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 
      1.08 (1.01-1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared 
      with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by 
      a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard 
      ratio 3.14 (1.04-9.44), P = 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that AAC is 
      prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD 
      mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and 
      involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for 
      evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

TI  - Impact of Abdominal Aortic Calcification on Central Haemodynamics and Decline of 
      Glomerular Filtration Rate in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4.
PG  - 950-960
LID - 10.1159/000501687 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this population. 
      The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic calcification volume 
      (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 
      a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD 
      stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective observational study. At study 
      entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, 
      haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: 
      The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 
      m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 
      patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only 
      statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male 
      gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 
      0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently 
      associated with AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the 
      presence nor the extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change 
      in GFR during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 
      and 4, only age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not 
      associated with the rate of decline in GFR.

TI  - Vascular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients: 
      interrelationship and clinical impacts.
PG  - 557-563
LID - 10.7150/ijms.23700 [doi]
AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular 
      calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and 
      cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance HD 
      patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest radiographs 
      were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 100 patients 
      (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC 
      (70% vs. 50.2%, P=0.001). VC was independently associated with a 2.42-fold increased 
      risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients 
      with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was independently associated 
      with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or LVH alone was not. Patients 
      with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a composite event of deaths or CVE 
      (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant synergistic interaction was observed 
      between VC and LVH (P for interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently 
      associated with LVH. The coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk 
      of deaths and CVEs than either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic 
      interaction for the risk of deaths and CVEs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is commonly observed in chronic 
      dialysis patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We 
      investigated the factors associated with AAC and analyze the relationship between 
      bone-derived biomarkers and AAC. METHODS: We enrolled 227 stable hemodialysis 
      patients. Vascular calcifications were assessed using lateral lumbar radiography of 
      the abdominal aorta. Demographic data were collected and serum levels of biochemical 
      and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), and 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), were measured. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one 
      patients (71.0%) had AAC. Patients with AAC score≧13 were older, with higher body 
      mass index (BMI), serum calcium, calcium phosphate product, high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and FGF23 levels. Sclerostin and DKK-1 levels were 
      inversely associated with AAC severity, and FGF23 was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Hypertension, vascular disease, hsCRP, FGF23, and sclerostin were 
      independent AAC determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hemodialysis patients have a high 
      prevalence of vascular calcifications. Levels of circulating sclerostin, DKK-1, and 
      FGF23 were related to AAC severity. Sclerostin and FGF23 were independently 
      associated with AAC.

TI  - Arterial Stiffness as a Risk Factor for Subclinical Coronary Artery Calcification in 
      Predialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: From the KNOW-CKD Study.
PG  - 426-434
LID - 10.1159/000499648 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Both arterial stiffness and coronary artery calcification (CAC) are 
      important predictors of cardiovascular disease in the general population and in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Recent studies on arterial stiffness and CAC 
      in subjects with preserved renal function have verified the association between the 
      two. However, the relationship is not well evaluated in CKD patients. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study analyzed 1,385 predialysis CKD patients from the KNOW-CKD 
      cohort. Participants were divided into four groups according to brachial-ankle pulse 
      wave velocity (baPWV) quartile. Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) were assessed 
      using cardiac computed tomography and CAC was defined as a CACS >100. RESULTS: CAC 
      prevalence was higher in the higher baPWV groups (6.4, 9.8, 23.7, and 43.8% for the 
      1st to 4th quartiles of baPWV, respectively, p < 0.001). In Tobit regression 
      analyses that were fully adjusted for traditional and renal cardiovascular risk 
      factors, the CACS ratio comparing the highest and lowest baPWV quartiles was 3.03 
      (95% CI, 1.59-6.87). Similarly, the OR for CAC in the highest baPWV quartile 
      compared to the lowest quartile was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.09-3.60) in a fully adjusted 
      multivariate logistic model. Results were consistent across analyses with different 
      cutoffs for CAC or with different clinically relevant subgroups. CONCLUSION: 
      Increased arterial stiffness measured by high baPWV was associated with CAC in a 
      predialysis CKD cohort. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the effect of 
      arterial stiffness on the development or progression of CAC in CKD.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for vascular calcification in Chinese patients receiving 
      dialysis: baseline results from a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1491-1500
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1467886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With limited data available on calcification prevalence in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients on dialysis, the China Dialysis Calcification Study (CDCS) 
      determined the prevalence of vascular/valvular calcification (VC) and association of 
      risk factors in Chinese patients with prevalent hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). METHODS: CKD patients undergoing HD/PD for ≥6 months were enrolled. 
      Prevalence data for calcification and medical history were documented at baseline. 
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed by electron beam or multi-slice 
      computed tomography (EBCT/MSCT), abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) by lateral 
      lumbar radiography, and cardiac valvular calcification (ValvC) by echocardiography. 
      Serum phosphorus, calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D and FGF-23 were evaluated. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the 
      association between risk factors and VC. RESULTS: Of 1,497 patients, 1,493 (78.3% 
      HD, 21.7% PD) had ≥1 baseline calcification image (final analysis cohort, FAC) and 
      1,423 (78.8% HD, 21.2% PD) had baseline calcification data complete (BCDC). 
      Prevalence of VC was 77.4% in FAC (80.8% HD, 65.1% PD, p < .001) and 77.5% in BCDC 
      (80.7% HD, 65.8% PD). The proportion of BCDC patients with single-site calcification 
      were 20% for CAC, 4.3% for AAC, and 4.3% for cardiac valvular calcification (ValvC), 
      respectively. Double site calcifications were 23.4% for CAC and AAC, 6.5% for CAC 
      and ValvC, and 1.1% for AAC and ValvC, respectively. In total, 17.9% patients had 
      calcification at all three sites. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of total VC in 
      Chinese CKD patients will supplement current knowledge, which is mostly limited, 
      contributing in creating awareness and optimizing VC management.

AB  - Inflammation is central to chronic kidney disease (CKD) pathogenesis and vascular 
      outcomes, but the exact players remain unidentified. Since low density granulocytes 
      (LDGs) are emerging mediators in inflammatory conditions, we aimed to evaluate 
      whether LDGs may be altered in CKD and related to clinical outcomes as biomarkers. 
      To his end, LDGs subsets were measured in peripheral blood by flow cytometry and 
      confocal microscopy in 33 CKD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 15 healthy 
      controls (HC). Analyses were replicated in an additional cohort. DEF3 (marker of 
      early granulopoiesis) gene expression on PBMCs was quantified by qPCR. Total CD15(+) 
      LDGs and both CD14(low)CD16(+) and CD14(-)CD16(-) subsets were expanded in CKD. The 
      relative frequency of the CD14(-)CD16(-) subpopulation was higher among the CD15(+) 
      pool in CKD. This alteration was stable over-time. The increased 
      CD14(-)CD16(-)CD15(+) paralleled Kauppila scores and DEF3 expression, whereas no 
      association was found with CD14(low)CD16(+) CD15(+). Both subsets differed in their 
      CD11b, CD10, CD35, CD31, CD62L, IFNAR1 and CD68 expression, FSC/SSC features and 
      nuclear morphology, pointing to different origins and maturation status. In 
      conclusion, LDGs were expanded in CKD showing a skewed distribution towards a 
      CD14(-)CD16(-)CD15(+) enrichment, in association with vascular calcification. DEF3 
      expression in PBMC can be a marker of LDG expansion.

TI  - Lower Serum Irisin Levels Are Associated with Increased Vascular Calcification in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1159/000487689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular 
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is prevalent 
      and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex and unclear. 
      We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play roles in vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate serum irisin 
      levels and establish their relation to vascular calcification and other parameters 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 150 patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in 
      this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA. 
      Vascular calcification was evaluated by abdominal aortic calcification scores. 
      RESULTS: Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis 
      patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0) vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, 
      P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively correlated with the parathyroid hormone 
      level (P=0.01). The HD patients with vascular calcification showed significantly 
      lower serum irisin concentrations [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, 
      P<0.01]. Compared with the group without vascular calcification multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were 
      significant independent determinant factors for vascular calcification in HD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Our results are the first to provide a clinical evidence of 
      the association between serum irisin and vascular calcification in HD patients. 
      Lower irisin levels, long-term hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk 
      factors in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis (HD) patients have heavy calcium deposits in their stenotic 
      coronary arteries and worse post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prognoses 
      than those who do not undergo HD. Rotational atherectomy (RA) facilitates PCI 
      success in severely calcified lesions. We aimed to identify clinical and procedural 
      characteristics that predict HD patients' long-term prognoses after PCI that 
      included RA in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era. METHODS: This study included 302 
      patients who underwent regular HD from J2T Multicenter Registry database of 1090 
      consecutive patients who underwent RA to treat de novo calcified lesions at three 
      university hospitals between 2004 and 2015. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular 
      (CV) death. RESULTS: During the 5-year observation period, 59 CV deaths (19.5%) 
      occurred. The CV death group and non-CV death group had comparable profiles except 
      significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher brain natriuretic 
      peptide (BNP), lower rate of RA burr upsizing, and lower rate of final thrombolysis 
      in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow achievement in the CV death group. Cox 
      regression analysis revealed that increasing ablation burr size (hazard ratio [HR]: 
      0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.81), final TIMI 3 flow (HR: 0.07; 95% CI: 
      0.02-0.28), lower BNP level, and optimal medication were independently associated 
      with better CV mortality in HD patients. CONCLUSION: In the DES era, oral 
      medications at the time of PCI and stepwise calcium ablation were associated with 
      improved long-term CV mortality in HD patients who are scheduled to undergo RA to 
      treat severely calcified coronary artery stenoses, as therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Gustatory Function and the Uremic Toxin, Phosphate, Are Modulators of the Risk of 
      Vascular Calcification among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12060420 [doi]
LID - 420
AB  - Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of vascular 
      calcification (VC), including aortic arch calcification (AAC). Few investigated the 
      influence of gustatory function on the probability of having VC. We examined whether 
      gustatory function results modulated the probability of having VC in patients with 
      CKD. We prospectively enrolled adults with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), with their AAC rated semi-quantitatively and gustatory 
      function assessed by objective and subjective approaches. Multiple logistic 
      regression was used to analyze the relationship between gustatory function results 
      and AAC. Those with AAC had significantly better objective gustatory function in 
      aggregate scores (p = 0.039) and categories (p = 0.022) and less defective bitter 
      taste (p = 0.045) and scores (p = 0.037) than those without. Multiple regression 
      analyses showed that higher aggregate scores (odds ratio (OR) 1.288, p = 0.032), or 
      better gustatory function, and higher bitter taste scores (OR 2.558, p = 0.019) were 
      each associated with a higher probability of having AAC among CKD patients; such an 
      association was modulated by serum phosphate levels. In conclusion, better gustatory 
      function was independently correlated with having AAC among CKD patients. A 
      follow-up of VC severity may be an underrecognized component of care for CKD 
      patients with a preserved gustatory function.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal aortic calcification by computed tomography for prediction 
      of latent left ventricular stiffness and future cardiovascular risk in pre-dialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease: A single center cross-sectional study.
PG  - 939-948

AB  - Introduction: There is general interest in finding clinical markers for left 
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), a major cause of cardiorenal syndrome 
      leading to heart failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim was to 
      assess the utility of computed tomography (CT)-based abdominal aortic calcification 
      (AAC) for the prediction of LVDD and prognosis of asymptomatic pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients. Materials and methods: We prospectively evaluated 218 pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients [median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); 40.9 mL/min/1.73m²]. 
      Non-contrast CT scan and echocardiography were performed to determine the aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) as a semi-quantitative measure of AAC. Results: The median 
      ACI was 11.4. AAC and LVDD were diagnosed in 193 patients (89%) and 75 patients 
      (34%), respectively. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the 
      estimation of LVDD, ACI of 20 showed optimal sensitivity (52.0%) and specificity 
      (62.8 %) (AUC = 0.664, p < .001). High ACI group included more patients with 
      LVDD-related factors, such as old age, hypertension, diabetes, and more severe CKD. 
      LVDD was significantly more common in patients with high ACI group [39 (50%) and 36 
      (26%), respectively, p<0.001]. Multivariate analysis showed that ACI correlated 
      significantly with E/A (β=-0.993, p=0.003), E/e' (β=0.077, p<0.001), and 
      cardio-ankle vascular index (β=0.209, p=0.001). Correspondingly, E/e' correlated 
      with logBNP and log(ACI+1), and increased proportionately and significantly with the 
      quartiles of ACI values. Cox proportional hazard models showed that ACI was an 
      independent predictor of CV outcome (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 
      1.00-1.06, p=0.029). Conclusion: The results would suggest the usefulness of AAC 
      assessment by CT to predict latent LVDD and future CV risk in asymptomatic 
      pre-dialysis CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary arterial plaques in patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) are assumed to have increased calcification due to underlying renal disease 
      or initiation of dialysis. This relationship may be confounded by comorbid type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: From a single-center OCT registry, 60 patients were 
      analyzed. Twenty patients with ESRD and diabetes (ESRD-DM) were compared to 2 groups 
      of non-ESRD patients: 20 with and 20 without diabetes. In each patient, one 20 mm 
      segment within the culprit vessel was analyzed. RESULTS: ESRD-DM patients exhibited 
      similar calcium burden, arc, and area compared to patients with diabetes alone. When 
      compared to patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes exhibited a greater 
      summed area of calcium (DM: Median 9.0, IQR [5.3-28] mm(2) vs Non-DM: 3.5 [0.1-14] 
      mm(2), p = 0.04) and larger calcium deposits by arc (DM: Mean 45 ± SE 6.2° vs 
      Non-DM: 21 ± 6.2°, p = 0.01) and area (DM: 0.58 ± 0.10 mm(2) vs Non-DM: 
      0.26 ± 0.10 mm(2), p = 0.03). Calcification deposits in ESRD-DM patients 
      (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) and patients with diabetes (0.14 ± 0.02 mm) were more superficially 
      located relative to patients without diabetes (0.21 ± 0.02 mm), p = 0.01 for both. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary calcification in DM and ESRD-DM groups exhibited similar 
      burden, deposit size, and depth within the arterial wall. The increase in coronary 
      calcification and cardiovascular disease events seen in ESRD-DM patients may not be 
      secondary to ESRD and dialysis, but instead due to a combination of declining renal 
      function and diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) and atherosclerosis are associated 
      with an increased cardiovascular morbimortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN) are involved in both VC and CKD. Soluble 
      tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) has been related to 
      cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that OPG, OPN and sTWEAK levels may be 
      associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. 
      METHODS: The presence of calcified or non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques was 
      assessed in 1043 stage 3 to 5D CKD patients from The NEFRONA Study. Biochemical 
      measurements and OPG, OPN and sTWEAK serum levels were analyzed. Patients were 
      followed for cardiovascular outcomes (41 ± 16 months). RESULTS: At recruitment, 26% 
      of CKD patients had VC. The adjusted odds ratios for having VC were 2.22 
      (1.32-3.75); p=.003 for OPG, and 0.45 (0.24-0.84); p=.01 for sTWEAK concentrations. 
      After follow-up, 95 CV events occurred. In a Cox model, patients with OPG or OPN 
      above and sTWEAK below their optimal cut-off points had an adjusted higher risk of 
      cardiovascular events [HR: 2.10 (1.49-3.90); p=.02; 1.65 (1.02-2.65); p=.04; 2.05 
      (1.28-3.29), p=.003; respectively]. When CKD patients were grouped according to the 
      number of biomarkers above (OPG and OPN) or below (sTWEAK) their cut-off points, the 
      combination of these biomarkers showed the highest risk for cardiovascular events 
      [HR: 9.46 (3.80-23.5) p < .001]. A composite score of these three biomarkers 
      increased the C-statistic and net reclassification index beyond conventional risk 
      factors and VC. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of OPG, OPN and sTWEAK increased the 
      predictability of cardiovascular outcomes.

PG  - 48-51
LID - 10.5414/CN109470 [doi]
AB  - The current case report describes a chronic hemodialysis patient presenting with 
      painful penile ulceration that was clinically and histologically proven to be 
      related to calcific uremic arteriolopathy. The patient subsequently developed severe 
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding that was both endoscopically and histologically 
      shown to be due to acute esophageal necrosis (AEN), also known as necrotizing 
      esophagitis and "black esophagus". AEN is a rare condition characterized by diffuse 
      necrosis of the esophageal mucosa. The condition is diagnosed endoscopically with 
      demonstration of circumferential mucosal necrosis involving the distal esophagus 
      that can extend proximally. Mortality rates for both calcific uremic ateriolopathy 
      and acute esophageal necrosis are high. Management of both conditions is reviewed. 
      The patient recovered from the acute illness, but expired 6 months later due to 
      progressive failure to thrive. To our knowledge, AEN has not previously been 
      described secondary to calcific uremic arteriolopathy. .

TI  - FGF-23, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular diseases in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 121-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0422-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients have bad prognosis and 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent their main threatening complication. 
      Fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) has been associated with all kinds of evil 
      consequences, including cardiovascular morbidity, but some studies demonstrated the 
      contrary. Therefore, it is important to know whether FGF-23 is associated with 
      cardiovascular risk or protection. The purpose of this study was to assess the links 
      between FGF-23 and intimal vascular calcification (VC) and with the presence of CVD 
      in chronic HD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on a cohort 
      of randomly selected 88 prevalent HD patients. We recorded demographical, clinical, 
      and biochemical data, including FGF-23. VC was evaluated on carotid ultrasound. CVD 
      were registered. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.68 ± 14.49 years, HD vintage was 59.61 
      ± 52.39 months, and 20 patients were diabetic (22.72 %). VC was present in 54 
      patients (61.4 %) and 25 patients (28.4 %) had CVD. FGF-23 correlated positively 
      with HD vintage (r = 0.37; p < 0.001) and iPTH (r = 0.21; p = 0.048). FGF-23 did not 
      correlate with VC score. Patients with CVD were older (p = 0.006), had lower FGF-23 
      (p = 0.008), higher VC score (p = 0.009), lower Hb (p = 0.008), albumin (p = 0.003), 
      and creatinine (p = 0.03). Low FGF-23 was identified as a risk factor for CVD. 
      CONCLUSION: We report on a novel association between low FGF23 and CVD in chronic HD 
      patients and a lack of correlation of FGF-23 with VC. FGF-23 could play a role in 
      cardiovascular protection that remains to be confirmed in larger studies.

PG  - 1102-1111
LID - 10.7150/ijms.45470 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with high 
      prevalence rates of proteinuria, vascular calcification and cardiomegaly. In this 
      study, we investigated relationships among proteinuria, aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) and cardio-thoracic ratio (CTR) in patients with CKD stage 3A-5. In addition, 
      we investigated correlations among proteinuria and decline in renal function, 
      overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Methods: We enrolled 482 pre-dialysis 
      patients with CKD stage 3A-5, and determined AoAC and CTR using chest radiography at 
      enrollment. The patients were stratified into four groups according to quartiles of 
      urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (U(PCR)). Results: The patients in quartile 4 had 
      a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope, and higher prevalence 
      rates of rapid renal progression, progression to commencement of dialysis, overall 
      and CV mortality. Multivariable analysis showed that a high U(PCR) was associated 
      with high AoAC (unstandardized coefficient β: 0.315; p = 0.002), high CTR 
      (unstandardized coefficient β: 1.186; p = 0.028) and larger negative eGFR slope 
      (unstandardized coefficient β: -2.398; p < 0.001). With regards to clinical 
      outcomes, a high U(PCR) was significantly correlated with progression to dialysis 
      (log per 1 mg/g; hazard ratio [HR], 2.538; p = 0.003), increased overall mortality 
      (log per 1 mg/g; HR, 2.292; p = 0.003) and increased CV mortality (log per 1 mg/g; 
      HR, 3.195; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Assessing proteinuria may allow for the early 
      identification of high-risk patients and initiate interventions to prevent vascular 
      calcification, cardiomegaly, and poor clinical outcomes.

TI  - Plasma Complement Protein C3a Level Was Associated with Abdominal Aortic 
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.

AB  - The complement system plays an important role in cardiovascular disease in patients 
      on hemodialysis. Vascular calcification is also one of the major causes of 
      cardiovascular disease. We want to investigate the relationship between complement 
      activation and vascular calcification in dialyzed patients. One hundred eight 
      hemodialysis patients and 65 heathy controls were enrolled prospectively. Plasma 
      C3a, C5a, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) 
      levels were detected using ELISA. Plasma C3c, fB, fH, C1q, and C4 levels were 
      measured by immunity transmission turbidity. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      was measured by abdomen lateral plain radiograph, and the AAC score was calculated. 
      We identified increased level of MBL and decreased level of C3c and complement 
      factor B compared with normal control. However, C1q, complement factor H, and C4 
      levels remained at a similar level compared with individuals with normal renal 
      function. The C3a and C5a levels increased, without change of MAC. Forty two of 108 
      HD patients had the AAC score. C3a levels were correlated with AAC score (r = 0.461, 
      p = 0.002). The median C3a concentration was 238.72 (196.96, 323.41) ng/mL. When 
      evaluated as AAC categories (≤ 4, > 5) with ordinal logistic regression, univariate 
      analyses revealed that higher C3a levels were associated with severe AAC, while 
      multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and calcium level showed that higher 
      C3a levels (OR, 6.28 (1.25-31.69); p = 0.03) were associated with severe AAC. The 
      areas under the curve (AUC) for C3a to diagnose severe abdominal aortic 
      calcification were 0.75(0.58-0.92, 0.01). The complement system was activated in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Higher C3a levels are independently associated with severe 
      AAC. Plasma C3a might have a diagnostic value for the severe AAC in HD patients.

TI  - The interplay between bone and vessels in pediatric CKD: lessons from a 
      single-center study.
PG  - 1565-1575
LID - 10.1007/s00467-018-3978-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mineral and bone disorders associated to chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD) 
      are a daily challenge for pediatric nephrologists, with a significant risk of 
      long-term bone and vascular comorbidities. METHODS: This single-center study is a 
      prospective transversal evaluation of pediatric CKD patients of our center, part of 
      the European 4C study. In addition to clinical and biochemical data, vascular and 
      bone evaluation was performed: 24-h blood pressure assessment, carotid intima-media 
      thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and high-resolution peripheral 
      quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the ultra-distal tibia. Results are 
      presented as median (range). RESULTS: At a median age of 12.9 years (10.2-17.9), SDS 
      height of - 1.0 (- 3.3-1.2) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
      33 mL/min/1.73m(2) (11-72), 32 patients (8 girls) were evaluated. Median calcium, 
      phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25 OHD3 levels were 2.44 mmol/L 
      (2.24-2.78), 1.43 mmol/L (1.0-2.7), 80 pg/mL (9-359), and 70 nmol/L (32-116), 
      respectively. Bivariate Spearman and backward multivariable analyses showed that 
      calcium and bone trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), were positively associated with 
      diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (both for the 24 h, day and night 
      assessment), whereas PTH and vitamin D did not predict blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We show that the greater the serum levels of calcium, the greater the (diastolic and 
      mean) blood pressure; moreover, the greater the Tb. Th, the greater the (diastolic 
      and mean) blood pressure. The role of calcium supplements to explain such findings 
      in early pediatric CKD can be discussed.

TI  - Vascular calcification burden of Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease: 
      methodology of a cohort study.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0132-3 [doi]
LID - 129
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a common complication associated with chronic 
      kidney disease and the major cause of cardiovascular disease in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease. The vascular calcification risk burden is still unknown in 
      China. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of vascular calcification and 
      assess the predictive value of vascular calcification in patients with stage 5 
      chronic kidney disease on dialysis in China. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a national, 
      multicenter, non-interventional, prospective cohort study planning to recruit 1520 
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis 
      for at least 6 months in 24 dialysis centers in China. All the patients provided 
      written informed consents before participating in this study. It will include a 
      baseline visit and 24 months follow-up period with 4 other visits at 6-month 
      intervals. Vascular calcification images will be obtained to determine the 
      prevalence of vascular calcification, coronary artery calcification, abdominal 
      aortic calcification and cardiac valve calcification. Association between vascular 
      calcification and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events will be assessed. Disease management, as assessed by serum 
      level of calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone and its impact on 
      vascular calcification, will also be surveyed. DISCUSSION: The new results gained 
      from this study will supplement limited current available data and provide better 
      clinical decisions in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.

TI  - Relationship between serum sclerostin, vascular sclerostin expression and vascular 
      calcification assessed by different methods in ESRD patients eligible for renal 
      transplantation: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 311-323
LID - 10.1007/s11255-018-2033-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification (VC) is known to be prevalent in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Sclerostin has been identified to be involved in the 
      cross-talk between the kidney, vasculature, and bone. The aims of the present study 
      were to evaluate vessel sclerostin expression and its correlation with VC, as well 
      as serum sclerostin levels. METHODS: A total of 51 adult ESRD patients undergoing 
      living donor renal transplant (RT) were enrolled in this study. Serum sclerostin 
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The thoracic aorta 
      calcification (TAC) was measured by computed tomography (CT). The aortic 
      calcification area index (ACAI) was used to evaluate the severity of TAC. During the 
      RT surgery, the internal iliac arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded in 40 
      patients, followed by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression and von 
      Kossa-staining for vascular medial calcification degree. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      rate of TAC detected by CT was 58.82%. The positive rates of the internal iliac 
      arterial calcification and vessel sclerostin expression were both 45%. Vessel 
      sclerostin was strongly co-localized with medial calcification. Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that only serum sclerostin was significantly associated with the 
      presence of TAC, the severity of TAC and the positive expression of vessel 
      sclerostin. Kappa test showed that the consistency of the two different 
      calcification assessment methods, as well as the consistency of vessel sclerostin 
      expression and von Kossa-staining were high. Furthermore, the cutoff points of serum 
      sclerostin for vessel sclerostin expression, the presence of VC evaluated by CT and 
      that evaluated by pathology were 1599.92 pg/mL, 2475.52 pg/mL, and 2116.23 pg/mL, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two methods, namely CT and pathology, to evaluate VC 
      were highly consistent. Serum sclerostin was an independent determinant of positive 
      expression of vessel sclerostin and VC in ESRD patients eligible for RT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common, serious and elusive complication 
      of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As a pro-calcifying risk factor, non-thyroidal 
      illness may promote vascular calcification through a systemic lowering of vascular 
      calcification inhibitors such as matrix-gla protein (MGP) and Klotho. METHODS AND 
      MATERIAL: In 97 ESRD patients eligible for living donor kidney transplantation, 
      blood levels of thyroid hormones (fT3, fT4 and TSH), total uncarboxylated MGP 
      (t-ucMGP), desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), descarboxyprothrombin 
      (PIVKA-II), and soluble Klotho (sKlotho) were measured. The degree of coronary 
      calcification and arterial stiffness were assessed by means of cardiac CT-scans and 
      applanation tonometry, respectively. RESULTS: fT3 levels were inversely associated 
      with coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores and measures of arterial stiffness, 
      and positively with dp-ucMGP and sKlotho concentrations. Subfractions of MGP, 
      PIVKA-II and sKlotho did not associate with CAC scores and arterial stiffness. fT4 
      and TSH levels were both inversely associated with CAC scores, but not with arterial 
      stiffness. DISCUSSION: The positive associations between fT3 and dp-ucMGP and 
      sKlotho suggest that synthesis of MGP and Klotho is influenced by thyroid hormones, 
      and supports a link between non-thyroidal illness and alterations in calcification 
      inhibitor levels. However, the absence of an association between serum calcification 
      inhibitor levels and coronary calcification/arterial stiffness and the fact that MGP 
      and Klotho undergo post-translational modifications underscore the complexity of 
      this association. Further studies, measuring total levels of MGP and membrane bound 
      Klotho, should examine this proposed pathway in further detail.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous 
      pancreas-kidney transplantation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/nep.12212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD 
      artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients 
      undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD. METHODS: Laboratory testing 
      was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) 
      transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral 
      abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale. 
      RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their 
      median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months 
      (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with 
      the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence 
      of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate 
      analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer 
      dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). 
      In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, 
      presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, 
      and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. CONCLUSION: VC 
      is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older 
      patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. 
      However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association 
      of VC to BMD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) confers a marked increase in 
      risk for vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, fracture and mortality, 
      with likely contributing factors including dysregulated bone metabolism and mineral 
      homeostasis. In general population studies, increased vascular calcification is 
      directly related to mortality and inversely related to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In patients with CKD, 
      abnormalities in turnover, mineralization and bone volume reduce the ability of DXA 
      to predict fracture. The trabecular bone score (TBS) obtained from lumbar spine DXA 
      images, provides a surrogate measure of microarchitectural integrity not captured by 
      BMD. This study aimed to examine the association of the TBS to prevalent abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) in patients with CKD receiving dialysis. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study of dialysis patients awaiting transplantation. All 
      patients underwent laboratory testing, lateral spinal radiographs including the 
      abdominal aorta, DXA imaging and TBS assessment. AAC scores were determined using 
      the Kauppila method. Correlations and linear regression models were used to 
      determine predictors of AAC scores. RESULTS: 146 patients (60% male, mean age 
      48 ± 13 years) were included, of whom 49% had prevalent calcification with an AAC 
      score ≥ 1. Of those with calcification, the mean AAC score was 7 ± 5.5 and 42 
      patients had scores ≥ 6, considered to indicate severe AAC. TBS values corresponding 
      to intermediate or high risk for fracture (<1.31) were present in 35% of patients. 
      TBS values correlated inversely to AAC scores (β = -0.206, p = 0.013) and remained 
      significant in multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, BMI and time on 
      dialysis (-0.160, p = 0.031). There was no significant correlation of AAC scores to 
      any BMD parameter. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of AAC in relatively young 
      dialysis patients awaiting transplantation and their AAC scores are inversely 
      related to the TBS but not to DXA-derived BMD parameters. In patients with CKD on 
      dialysis, TBS assessment reflects microarchitectural abnormalities of bone not 
      captured by DXA. The inverse relationship of TBS to vascular calcification may 
      provide insights into bone-vascular interactions in CKD.

AB  - Elevated levels of FGF23 in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are 
      associated with adverse health outcomes, such as increased mortality, large vessel 
      disease, and reduced white matter volume, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. 
      Apart from the well-known link between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, especially 
      diabetes and hypertension, and cerebrovascular damage, elevated FGF23 is also 
      postulated to be associated with cerebrovascular damage independently of CKD. 
      Elevated FGF23 predisposes to vascular calcification and is associated with vascular 
      stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in the general population with normal renal 
      function. These factors may lead to microangiopathic changes in the brain, 
      cumulative ischemia, and eventually to the loss of white matter fibers. The 
      relationship between FGF23 and brain integrity in individuals without CKD has 
      hitherto not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the association 
      between FGF23, and white matter integrity in a cohort of 50 participants with 
      varying degrees of CV risk burden, using high resolution structural human brain 
      connectomes constructed from MRI diffusion images. We observed that increased FGF23 
      was associated with axonal loss in the frontal lobe, leading to a fragmentation of 
      white matter network organization. This study provides the first description of the 
      relationship between elevated levels of FGF23, white matter integrity, and brain 
      health. We suggest a synergistic interaction of CV risk factors and FGF23 as a 
      potentially novel determinant of brain health.

TI  - In-situ analysis of mast cells and dendritic cells in coronary atherosclerosis in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).
PG  - 871-886
LID - 10.14670/HH-11-988 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Mast cells (MC) and dendritic cells (DC) have immune modulatory function and 
      can influence T-cell activity. Both cell types have been found in atherosclerotic 
      plaques and are thought to play an important role for plaque stability. Compared to 
      matched segments of the non-renal population, patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) show a more pronounced and more aggressive course of atherosclerosis with 
      higher plaque calcification and significantly higher complications rates. It was the 
      aim of this study to analyze the number and localization of MCs and DCs, 
      macrophages, T- and B-cells as well as the expression of markers of inflammation 
      such as CRP and NFκB in calcified and non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques of 
      patients with CKD and control patients. METHODS: Fifty coronary atherosclerotic 
      plaques from patients with endstage CKD (CKD, n=25) and control (n=25) patients were 
      categorized according to the Stary classification and investigated using 
      immunohistochemistry (markers for MC, DC, T, B, macrophage and NFκB). Expression was 
      analyzed separately for the complete plaque area as well as for the different plaque 
      subregions and correlations were analyzed. RESULTS: We found only very few DCs and 
      MCs per lesion area with slightly increased numbers in calcified plaques. MCs per 
      plaque area were significantly more frequent in CKD than in control patients and 
      this was independent of plaque calcification. MCs were most frequently found in the 
      shoulder and basis of the plaque. DCs per plaque area were significantly less in 
      calcified plaques of CKD compared to control patients. In control, but not in CKD 
      patients, DCs were significantly more frequent in calcified than in non-calcified 
      plaques. Within the plaques DCs were similarly distributed between all 4 subregions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary atherosclerotic plaques of CKD patients showed a significantly 
      higher number of MCs whereas DCs were less frequent compared to control patients 
      particularly if plaques were calcified. These findings might indicate a potential 
      proinflammatory role of MCs, but not of DCs in atherosclerotic lesions of CKD 
      patients, adding another characteristic of advanced atherosclerosis in these 
      patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1543-3 [doi]
LID - 345
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from 
      cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play 
      a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify 
      CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe 
      hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 
      2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and 
      clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were 
      analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 
      patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 
      AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of 
      patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In 
      univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total 
      cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely 
      correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In 
      multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that 
      CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral 
      neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with 
      Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

PG  - 262-8
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2014.00250 [doi]
AB  - ♦ BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is strongly associated with cardiovascular 
      disease and mortality. However, some factors related to vascular calcification in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain 
      unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of osteoprotegerin (OPG), 
      osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), 
      magnesium, and phosphate clearance with vascular calcification in PD subjects, 
      assessed by plain radiographs. ♦ METHODS: Simple vascular calcification scores 
      (SVCS) obtained from plain X-rays of the pelvis and hands, and the Kauppila Index 
      (KI) from lateral lumbar X-rays were assessed in 76 adults receiving PD for ≥ 6 
      months (43 women, median age 39 years, median time on PD 1.4 years). Levels of OPG, 
      OPN, OCN, and FGF-23 were determined by luminometry. ♦ RESULTS: Serum OPG levels 
      were higher in subjects with vascular calcification (n = 22 with SVCS > 3; n = 19 
      with KI > 7) compared with those with less calcification (p < 0.001). Spearman's 
      correlation coefficients between OPG and SVCS and KI were r = 0.49 and r = 0.51, 
      respectively (both p < 0.001). Subjects with vascular calcification had 
      significantly lower renal phosphate clearance. Multiple regression analysis showed 
      that vascular calcification assessed by SVCS was associated with age (r = 0.2, p = 
      0.042), diabetes mellitus (r = 2.4, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.09, p = 
      0.037), and OPG (r = 0.22, p = 0.001). Vascular calcification assessed by KI was 
      associated with age (r = 0.16, p < 0.001), time on PD (r = 0.54, p = 0.001) and OPG 
      (r = 0.08, p = 0.04). Osteocalcin, OPN, FGF-23, and magnesium were not associated 
      with vascular calcification. ♦ CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of OPG were consistently 
      associated with vascular calcification in subjects on PD.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score predicts the occurrence of coronary artery 
      disease in middle-aged peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 336-340
LID - 10.1111/nep.13231 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score in dialysis patients was associated 
      with coronary artery disease (CAD) in cross-sectional study, but the use of AAC 
      score in the CAD prediction was not clear. We aimed to use AAC score in the 
      estimation of CAD occurrence in middle-aged peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. 
      METHODS: Middle-aged (45-65 years old) PD patients were recruited and followed up 
      until CAD occurrence, patient mortality, or PD failure. We quantified AAC score by 
      lateral lumbar radiography, and used receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis to find 
      the cut-off value for CAD prediction. RESULTS: There were 187 patients recruited for 
      study with a mean follow-up of 1027 ± 427 days. AAC score in patients with CAD 
      during follow-up period (9.7 ± 7.6, n = 41) was higher than in patients without CAD 
      occurrence (5.5 ± 6.1, n = 146) (P < 0.001). Multivariate hazard ratio of AAC score 
      for CAD was 1.07 (P = 0.044). ROC showed that AAC score of 5.5 had a sensitivity of 
      0.667 and a specificity of 0.581 in the prediction of CAD occurrence. Patients with 
      AAC score above 5.5 had significantly higher cumulative incidence of CAD than 
      patients with AAC score below 5.5 (Log-rank test, P = 0.003). Age (P = 0.002), 
      diabetes (P = 0.002), hypertension (P = 0.032), longer dialysis vintage (P < 0.001) 
      and lower serum potassium (P = 0.012) were parameters significantly associated with 
      higher AAC score. CONCLUSION: AAC score can predict CAD occurrence in PD patients. 
      Age, diabetes, hypertension, dialysis vintage and serum potassium level are factors 
      associated with higher AAC score.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Fetuin-A: Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease in 
      Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1159/000491025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: "T50," shortened transformation time from primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein fetuin-A 
      is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid For Vascular Outcome Prevention 
      In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled 
      clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We 
      conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly selected subcohort of 
      patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum T50 and fetuin-A were 
      determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. 
      RESULTS: During a median surveillance of 2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD 
      events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were 
      associated with CVD after adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood 
      pressure, age, sex, race, preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, 
      total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin 
      inhibitor, or lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 
      urinary albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, 
      T50, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI 
      1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect 
      modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as reduced 
      fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained associated 
      with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD risk factors, 
      measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical characteristics and 
      demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term KTRs. Increased hsCRP was 
      an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are representative 
      markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical 
      outcomes remain undetermined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 523 patients with 
      nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been examined with fundus photography 
      for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple radiographs were analyzed for the 
      presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC of the abdominal aorta and 
      iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was evaluated in terms of the rate of 
      renal function decline and composite of any cardiovascular event or death. CKD 
      patients with retinopathy showed higher prevalence of apVC than those without 
      retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001).The presence of retinopathy was 
      independently associated with apVC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate 
      analysis, compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence 
      of both apVC and retinopathy were independently associated with rapid renal function 
      decline (β = -1.51; 95% CI -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were 
      not. Compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite 
      end points were 1.05 (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 
      1.17, 3.67) for patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with 
      both apVC and retinopathy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of VC and 
      retinopathy was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular 
      events or deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.

AB  - The effect of chronic metabolic acidosis (MA) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the 
      setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to 
      study this relationship in nondialysis CKD patients.This cross-sectional, 
      single-center study prospectively enrolled 95 clinically stable CKD patients (median 
      age 61 (58, 65) years, 60% male, median eGFR 27 (22, 32) mL/min). Data on CKD 
      etiology, CVD history, CVD traditional, and nontraditional risk factors were 
      obtained. Also, markers of subclinical CVD were assessed: intima-media thickness 
      (IMT), abdominal aortic calcifications (Kauppila score-AACs), cardio-ankle vascular 
      index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI), ejection fraction, and interventricular 
      septum thickness. Using the serum bicarbonate cutoff value of 22 mEq/L, comparisons 
      between MA (<22 mEq/L; 43 patients) and non-MA (≥22 mEq/L; 52 patients) groups were 
      performed.Vascular (40%), tubulointerstitial (24%), and glomerular (22%) 
      nephropathies were the main causes of CKD. Twenty-three percent of patients had 
      diabetes mellitus, but only 5% were considered to have diabetic nephropathy. 
      Patients with chronic MA had lower eGFR (P < .01), higher iPTH (P = .01), higher 
      serum phosphate (P < .01), and increased serum cholesterol (P = .04) and 
      triglycerides (P = .01).Higher ABI (P = .04), lower IMT (P = .03), CAVI (P = .05), 
      and AACs (P = .03) were found in patients with chronic MA.Separate binomial logistic 
      regression models were performed using ABI (cutoff 0.9), CAVI (cutoff 9), IMT 
      (cutoff 0.1 cm), and AACs (cutoff 1) as dependent variables. MA was used as 
      independent variable and adjustments were made for iPTH, serum phosphate, eGFR, 
      proteinuria, cholesterol, triglycerides, CVD score. The absence of MA was retained 
      as an independent predictor only for the presence of AACs.In conclusion, the present 
      study shows a potential advantageous effect of MA on vascular calcifications in 
      predialysis CKD patients. Thus, a guideline relaxation of the serum bicarbonate 
      target might prove to be beneficial in CKD patients at high risk of vascular 
      calcifications. However, one should always consider the negative effects of MA. 
      Therefore, additional research is warranted before any clear clinical 
      recommendation.

TI  - Frequency of abdominal aortic calcification in a group of Iraqi hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1098-104
AB  - Cardiovascular complications including abdominal aortic calcification significantly 
      affect the mortality and morbidity in patients on a hemodialysis (HD) program. The 
      objective of this study is to find the frequency of abdominal aortic calcification 
      in patients on regular HD and to evaluate the effect of parameters on frequency and 
      severity of abdominal aortic calcification. Fifty-four patients with end-stage renal 
      disease on regular HD were studied from January 2011 to December 2011 to evaluate 
      abdominal aortic calcification by plain abdominal X-ray. The study showed that 10 
      (18.5%) patients had abdominal aortic calcification. Only one (1.9%) had grade 3 
      calcification and among the remaining, five (9.3%) patients had grade 1 and four 
      (7.4%), grade 2. There was a statistically significant difference (P <0.05) in the 
      means of serum cholesterol among those with and without abdominal aortic 
      calcification. Hypertension was noticed in most patients with abdominal aortic 
      calcification. The frequency of abdominal aortic calcification is directly related 
      to age and duration of dialysis. The only biochemical parameter with a statistically 
      significant effect was serum cholesterol.

TI  - Association between Dietary Intake and Coronary Artery Calcification in Non-Dialysis 
      Chronic Kidney Disease: The PROGREDIR Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu10030372 [doi]
LID - 372
AB  - Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a widespread condition in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Diet may play an important role in CAC, but this role is not clear. 
      This study evaluated the association between macro-and micronutrient intakes and CAC 
      in non-dialysis CKD patients. We analyzed the baseline data from 454 participants of 
      the PROGREDIR study. Dietary intake was evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. 
      CAC was measured by computed tomography. After exclusion of participants with a 
      coronary stent, 373 people remained for the analyses. The highest tertile of CAC was 
      directly associated with the intake of phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. There was 
      a higher intake of pantothenic acid and potassium in the second tertile. After 
      adjustments for confounding variables, the intake of pantothenic acid, phosphorus, 
      calcium and potassium remained associated with CAC in the generalized linear mixed 
      models. In order to handle the collinearity between these nutrients, we used the 
      LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression to evaluate the 
      nutrients associated with CAC variability. In this approach, the nutrients that most 
      explained the variance of CAC were phosphorus, calcium and potassium. Prospective 
      studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess the role of interventions 
      regarding these micronutrients on CAC prevention and progression.

TI  - Nutrition Status Predicts Severity of Vascular Calcification in Non-Dialyzed Chronic 
      Kidney Disease.
PG  - 316-321
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-16-0911 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major complication in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) that increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Geriatric nutritional 
      risk index (GNRI) is a simple nutritional assessment tool that predicts poor 
      prognosis in elderly subjects. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the 
      correlation between GNRI and severity of vascular calcification in non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients.Methods and Results:We enrolled 323 asymptomatic CKD patients. To evaluate 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), we used aortic calcification index (ACI) 
      determined on non-contrast computed tomography. The patients were divided into three 
      groups according to GNRI tertile. Median ACI significantly decreased with increasing 
      GNRI tertile (15.5%, 13.6%, and 7.9%, respectively; P=0.001). On multivariate 
      regression analysis GNRI was significantly correlated with ACI (β=-0.15, P=0.009). 
      We also investigated the combination of GNRI and C-reactive-protein (CRP) for 
      predicting the severity of AAC. Low GNRI and high CRP were significantly associated 
      with severe AAC, compared with high GNRI and low CRP (OR, 4.07; P=0.004). 
      CONCLUSIONS: GNRI was significantly associated with AAC in non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Impact of BMI on cardiovascular events, renal function, and coronary artery 
      calcification.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1159/000362862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in the 
      general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI on 
      CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease not on 
      dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis initiation, 
      and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. METHODS: CKD patients were 
      divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of dialysis, and 
      extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and multivariable analysis 
      were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD 
      stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, 
      albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour 
      proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 
      years. RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 
      0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not increase 
      the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or 
      multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not 
      increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 
      0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 
      0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to 
      other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 
      95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of 
      CAC extent or progression. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High 
      BMI increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to 
      CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact 
      of high BMI on dialysis initiation.

TI  - FGF-23 levels are associated with vascular calcification, but not with 
      atherosclerosis, in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 609-17
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1231-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim 
      of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma 
      FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent 
      coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution color Doppler 
      ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs 
      was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 
      400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, 
      and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level 
      was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 
      0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence 
      of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal 
      regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs 
      together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model 
      r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in 
      patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the 
      prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with 
      carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

TI  - Low serum butyrylcholinesterase is independently related to low fetuin-A in patients 
      on hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1713-1720
LID - 10.1007/s11255-018-1957-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fetuin-A, which plays a protective role against the atherosclerosis and 
      progression of vascular calcification, is decreased in patients on hemodialysis 
      (HD). Fetuin-A and serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) levels decrease during 
      malnutrition. We explored whether BChE was independently related to fetuin-A in 
      patients on HD. METHODS: Laboratory data including BChE and serum fetuin-A were 
      acquired from 230 patients on HD between August 2017 and April 2018. Nutritional 
      status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). Abdominal 
      aortic calcification index (ACI) was measured using computed tomography. Patients 
      were stratified into two groups: low fetuin-A (< lowest quartile) and non-low 
      fetuin-A (≥ lowest quartile) groups. Patient background, medication, and laboratory 
      data were compared. The receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to 
      determine the optimal cutoff values of BChE and GNRI for lower fetuin-A level. 
      Factors independently related with lower fetuin-A levels were determined using 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The lowest quartile value of 
      fetuin-A and optimal cutoff values of BChE and GNRI were 0.213 g/L, 200 IU/L, and 
      92.6, respectively. The study included 57 and 173 patients in the low fetuin-A and 
      non-low fetuin-A groups, respectively. Significant between-group differences were 
      observed for age, C-reactive protein (CRP), history of cardiovascular disease, serum 
      albumin, GNRI, and BChE. Multivariate analysis showed that BChE of < 200 IU/L [odds 
      ratio (OR) 3.05], CRP (OR 2.49), and GNRI of < 92.6 (OR 2.34) were independent 
      factors for lower fetuin-A level after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: BChE 
      was a significant independent marker for fetuin-A levels in patients on HD, in 
      addition to GNRI.

TI  - Correlations of Plasma Desphosphorylated Uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein with 
      Vascular Calcification and Vascular Stiffness in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 167-172
LID - 10.1159/000453368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification 
      and needs vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. High levels of 
      desphosphorylated uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) were significantly associated with 
      vitamin K deficiency and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to explore 
      the correlations of plasma dp-ucMGP with vascular calcification and vascular 
      stiffness in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study enrolled 83 CKD stages 3-5 patients. Vascular calcification score was 
      determined by calcific lesions in the abdominal aorta (AAC) shown by lateral lumbar 
      film; vascular stiffness was assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and 
      pulse wave velocity, while plasma dp-ucMGP levels were measured using ELISA method. 
      Multivariate regression analyses were used to select factors that were independently 
      associated with vascular calcification and vascular stiffness. RESULTS: The mean age 
      was 62.9 ± 13.9 years. CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 constituted 51.8, 13.3, and 34.9%, 
      respectively. The median of plasma dp-ucMGP levels in CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 were 
      586 (452-888), 870 (594-1,591), and 1,050 (518-1,298) pmol/L, respectively. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification (AAC score ≥1) was 63.4% and that of vascular 
      stiffness (CAVI ≥9) was 46.3%. Vascular calcification was correlated with vascular 
      stiffness (r2 = 0.50, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis models 
      to predict vascular calcification showed that age and plasma dp-ucMGP levels were 
      significantly correlated with vascular calcification (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.09-1.33; p < 
      0.001 and OR 1.002; 95% CI 1.001-1.004; p = 0.004, respectively). In contrast, there 
      was no association between plasma dp-ucMGP levels and vascular stiffness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Plasma dp-ucMGP levels increase according to the severity of CKD. 
      Plasma dp-ucMGP was positively associated with vascular calcification and might be 
      utilized as an early marker for vascular calcification in CKD patients.

LID - 10.1159/000330327 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has peculiar 
      characteristics. The aim of this study was to analyze atherosclerosis, vascular 
      calcification and nitration in arteries from CKD patients. METHODS: External iliac 
      and renal artery segments from 27 stage 5 CKD patients and 25 donor controls, 
      respectively, were collected during the transplantation procedure. RESULTS: CKD 
      patients presented a significantly higher degree of lesion. In a large proportion 
      (72%) of CKD patients, we observed vascular calcifications. Immunohistochemistry for 
      nitrotyrosine revealed a significant increase in nitrotyrosine production in 
      arteries from CKD patients compared with control donors. In addition, within CKD 
      patients, nitrotyrosine staining was significantly stronger in arteries with media 
      calcification when compared with arteries without media calcification. CONCLUSION: 
      The arteriopathy in the CKD patients appears in an early age and seems to be 
      distinct from the arteriopathy of the general population, especially due to intense 
      calcification and vascular oxidative stress.

TI  - First-time-in-human randomized clinical trial in healthy volunteers and 
      haemodialysis patients with SNF472, a novel inhibitor of vascular calcification.
PG  - 2867-2876
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13752 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: SNF472 is a calcification inhibitor being developed for the treatment of 
      cardiovascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) and in calciphylaxis patients. 
      This study investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      intravenous (IV) SNF472 in healthy volunteers (HV) and HD patients. METHODS: This is 
      a first-time-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I study to 
      assess the safety, tolerability and PK of SNF472 after ascending single IV doses in 
      HV and a single IV dose in HD patients. A pharmacodynamic analysis was performed to 
      assess the capability of IV SNF472 to inhibit hydroxyapatite formation. RESULTS: 
      Twenty HV and eight HD patients were enrolled. The starting dose in HV was 
      0.5 mg kg(-1) and the dose ascended to 12.5 mg kg(-1) . The dose selected for HD 
      patients was 9 mg kg(-1) . Safety analyses support the safety and tolerability of IV 
      SNF472 in HD patients and HV. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild in 
      intensity. No clinically significant effects were observed on vital signs or 
      laboratory tests. PK results were similar in HD patients and HV and indicate a lack 
      of significant dialysability. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated that SNF472 
      administration reduced hydroxyapatite crystallization potential in HD patients who 
      received IV SNF472 9 mg kg(-1) by 80.0 ± 2.4% (mean ± standard error of the mean, 
      95% CI, 75.3-84.8) compared to placebo (8.7 ± 21.0%, P < 0.001, 95% CI, -32.4 to 
      49.7). CONCLUSION: The results from this study showed acceptable safety and 
      tolerability, and lack of significant dialysability of IV SNF472. It is a potential 
      novel treatment for cardiovascular calcification in end-stage renal disease and 
      calciphylaxis warranting further human studies.

TI  - Skin autofluorescence associates with vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1784-90

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between tissue advanced 
      glycation end products, as reflected by skin autofluorescence, and vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Three hundred 
      patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease underwent multislice computed 
      tomography to estimate total coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and had tissue 
      advanced glycation end product assessed using a skin autofluorescence reader. Intact 
      parathyroid hormone (P<0.001) displaced estimated glomerular filtration rate as 
      third most significant factor associated with skin autofluorescence after age 
      (P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (P<0.001) in multiple regression analysis. On 
      univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, every 1-U increase in skin 
      autofluorescence was associated with a 7.43-fold (95% confidence intervals, 
      3.59-15.37; P<0.001) increased odds of having CACS ≥400 compared with those with 
      zero CACS. Skin autofluorescence retained significance in predicting CACS ≥400 (odds 
      ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.44-9.18; P=0.006) when adjusting for age, 
      sex, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, C-reactive protein, lipids, blood pressure, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intact parathyroid hormone but marginally 
      lost significance when additionally adjusting for diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 
      2.23; 95% confidence intervals, 0.81-6.14; P=0.1). Combination of diabetes mellitus 
      and higher intact parathyroid hormone was associated with greater skin 
      autofluorescence and CACS versus those without diabetes mellitus and having lower 
      intact parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue advanced glycation end product, as 
      reflected by skin autofluorescence, showed a significant novel association with 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. These data suggest that increased 
      tissue advanced glycation end product may contribute to vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and warrant further experimental 
      investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND Determination of prognosis based on ischemia detection, using 
      single‑photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT‑MPI), 
      can be challenging in patients with multiple affected coronary arteries. AIMS The 
      aim of the study was to examine the outcomes of SPECT‑MPI combined with the coronary 
      artery calcium score (CACS) to identify predictors of adverse cardiac events (ACEs) 
      in patients for whom ischemia detection may be difficult using SPECT‑MPI. METHODS 
      The study group included 195 patients with a history of chronic kidney disease, 
      suspected ischemic cardiomyopathy, or left bundle branch block. All patients 
      underwent SPECT‑MPI and CACS evaluation. During the follow‑up, ACEs were recorded. 
      Perfusion and functional parameters as well as the CACS were analyzed to find the 
      predictors of ACEs. RESULTS The ACEs were recorded in 58 individuals (29.7%) and 
      were significantly associated with ischemia (P <0.001), abnormal functional 
      parameters (P = 0.04), and higher CACSs (P <0.001). The optimal cutoff value of the 
      CACS to predict an ACE was 530. Cox proportional hazards models revealed that age, 
      mild and severe ischemia, functional abnormalities, and a CACS of 530 or higher were 
      significant predictors of ACEs. In the subgroup of individuals without ischemia, a 
      CACS of 530 or higher was significantly associated with poor outcome, while we 
      recorded only 3 ACEs in these patients when the CACS was lower than 530. CONCLUSIONS 
      The addition of the CACS to SPECT‑MPI improves the identification of patients at 
      higher risk for ACEs, even in individuals for whom SPECT‑MPI is challenging.

TI  - Lower serum magnesium is associated with vascular calcification in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a cross sectional study.
PG  - 129

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent among dialysis 
      patients and is associated with increased cardiovascular and all cause mortality. 
      Magnesium (Mg) inhibits vascular calcification in animal and in-vitro studies but 
      whether the same effect occurs in humans is uncertain. METHODS: A single centre 
      cross-sectional study of 80 prevalent peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients; on PD only 
      for a minimum of 3 months. A radiologist blinded to patient status calculated their 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) scores on lateral lumbar spine radiographs, a 
      validated surrogate for CAC. RESULTS: Eighty patients provided informed consent and 
      underwent lumbar spine radiography. The mean serum Mg was 0.8 mmol/L (standard 
      deviation 0.2) and mean AAC score 8.9 (minimum 0, maximum 24). A higher serum Mg 
      level was associated with a lower AAC score (R (2) = 0.06, unstandardized 
      coefficient [B] = -7.81, p = 0.03), and remained after adjustment for age, serum 
      phosphate, serum parathyroid hormone, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking 
      history, and diabetes (model adjusted R (2) = 0.36, serum Mg and AAC score 
      B = -11.44, p = 0.00). This translates to a 0.1 mmol/L increase in serum Mg being 
      independently associated with a 1.1-point decrease in AAC score. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that Mg may inhibit vascular calcification. If this association is 
      replicated across larger studies with serial Mg and vascular calcification 
      measurements, interventions that increase serum Mg and their effect on vascular 
      calcification warrant further investigation in the PD population.

PG  - 822-827
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.239643 [doi]
AB  - Several biomolecules potentially serve as promoters or inhibitors of calcification 
      in dialysis patients which include fetuin A, matrix gla protein, osteopontin, 
      osteoprotegerin, etc. The primary aim was to compare the biomarkers of coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) and to study its role as predictors of CAC in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. Of 126 patients undergoing chronic HD, 100 patients 
      completed the study. Blood samples were drawn for serum creatinine, electrolytes, 
      calcium, phosphorus, Vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), lipid profile, high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, fetuin A, and fibroblast growth factor-23 
      (FGF-23). Non-contrast Computed Tomography scan of the coronary arteries was 
      conducted on all participants. Participants who were positive for CAC (P group) were 
      compared with those negative for CAC (N group) using two sample t-test. Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the predictors of CAC. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) was 60% with higher prevalence seen in 
      males (71%), older age group, patients with dialysis vintage >5 years (27%), and 
      diabetic population (62%). Mean serum phosphorus was significantly higher (P <0.001) 
      and fetuin A (P <0.001) was significantly lower in the P group. Age (OR: 1.2, P = 
      0.004), serum phosphorus (OR: 1.8, P = 0.024), and fetuin A (OR: 0.0006, P = 0.001) 
      were found as predictors of CAC. CAC was more prevalent in males, patients with 
      higher age group and in those with longer dialysis vintage and diabetic population. 
      Participants with CAC exhibited significantly high phosphorus and low fetuin A 
      levels. Age, phosphorus level, and fetuin A were found to be predictors of CAC in 
      dialysis patients. FGF-23 could not predict CAC.

TI  - Relation of fibroblast growth factor-23 and cardiovascular calcification in 
      end-stage kidney disease patients on regular hemodialysis.

AB  - More than half of deaths in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are due to 
      cardiovascular disease. Elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) was found to 
      be associated with mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients and correlates with 
      peripheral calcification. Aortic calcification is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification. Both aortic and peripheral vascular calcifications were associated 
      with mortality in chronic kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the relation 
      between intact FGF-23 and cardiovascular calcification in patients with ESKD who 
      were maintained on regular HD. Sixty clinically stable ESKD patients on regular HD 
      were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. They were evaluated by basal 
      abdominal X-ray. They were divided into two groups: (Group A, n = 30), patients with 
      abdominal aortic calcification who underwent multislice computerized tomography scan 
      to measure coronary artery calcification score; and (Group B, n = 30), patients 
      without abdominal aortic calcification. All of them were evaluated by lipid profile 
      and dialysis adequacy parameters. Fifty percent of patients had vascular 
      calcification. We found a significant positive correlation between age and intact 
      FGF-23; significant positive correlations between age, body mass index, duration of 
      HD, and abdominal aortic calcification score. FGF-23 of all patients was elevated 
      and had significant positive correlation with aortic and coronary calcifications in 
      addition to lipid profile, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and inflammatory 
      markers. Plasma intact FGF-23 was elevated in nondiabetic ESKD patients, and 
      vascular calcification was prevalent in such group of patients with many traditional 
      and nontraditional risk factors. Possibly through its disturbing effects on minerals 
      and parathyroid hormone, FGF-23 might indirectly affect vascular calcification. LVMI 
      was higher in patients with vascular calcification and correlated positively with 
      it.

AB  - Vascular calcification is common in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and can be 
      measured using abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). Loss of residual renal function 
      (RRF) is associated with increased mortality in HD patients. However, the 
      association between loss of RRF and vascular calcification is unknown. The aim of 
      the study was to analyze the association between loss of RRF and VC in HD patients. 
      All chronic HD (HD for more than 3 months) patients of China Medical University 
      Hospital in 2014 were included. AAC scores were measured semi-quantitatively based 
      on later lumbar radiographs. Loss of RRF was defined as urine output less than 200 
      mL per day. The association between loss of RRF and AAC was analyzed using logistic 
      regression. Four hundred and thirty-eight chronic HD patients with a mean age of 63 
      ± 12 years were analyzed. The median (interquartile range) AAC score of all patients 
      was 7 (2-13). The AAC score of patients with loss of RRF was 9 (3-22), significantly 
      higher than that of patients with RRF 5 (0-17) (P = 0.004). Loss of RRF, independent 
      of patients' age, diabetes, C-reactive protein, calcium-phosphorus product and 
      vintage of dialysis was associated with higher AAC scores. Loss of RRF was 
      associated with vascular calcification in HD patients.

TI  - Differential Impact of Chronic Kidney Disease on Coronary Calcification and

PG  - 228-236
LID - 10.1159/000489097 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the combined effects of chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and diabetes on the extent and developmental pattern of coronary 
      artery disease (CAD). METHODS: A total of 3,017 self-referred asymptomatic 
      individuals without known CAD who underwent 64-channel dual-source coronary computed 
      tomography angiography between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled. The patients were 
      divided into six groups based on their diabetes status (nondiabetic or diabetic) and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal renal 
      function; eGFR 60-89, mild CKD; or eGFR 30-59, moderate CKD). We compared the 
      coronary artery calcium score (CACS), segment stenosis score (SSS), and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD among the groups. RESULTS: In nondiabetics, whereas SSS and ≥50% 
      obstructive CAD were not different as renal function deteriorated, after adjusting 
      for cardiovascular risk factors, CACS showed a unique developmental pattern: no CACS 
      increase until mild CKD, but abrupt increase from the stage of moderate CKD 
      (moderate vs. normal renal function, adjusted OR 5.118, 95% CI 1.293-20.262, p = 
      0.020). In diabetics, patients from the stage of mild CKD were more likely to have 
      ≥50% obstructive CAD (p = 0.004), higher CACS (p = 0.020), and SSS (p = 0.001) in 
      multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CKD did not have a significant 
      impact on the development of coronary atherosclerosis, but affected the progression 
      of coronary calcification more markedly from the stage of moderate CKD in 
      nondiabetics. However, in diabetics, the deterioration of renal function was 
      significantly associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and 
      calcification from the stage of mild CKD.

TI  - Vascular calcification in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 777-80
AB  - Vascular calcifications represent a severe complication of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5. The 
      factors influencing the development of this complication are in close relation with 
      the pathology of chronic dialysis premorbid condition, and with therapy as well. The 
      present article highlights the association between several factors and the 
      development or the aggravation of vascular calcifications in continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The results are not always in accordance with 
      similar literature data, but there is a lack of researches regarding mineral 
      metabolism in peritoneal dialysis patients versus those on chronic hemodialysis.

TI  - Usefulness of pretransplant aortic arch calcification evaluation for kidney 
      transplant outcome prediction in one year follow-up.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455588 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events and 
      hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We aimed 
      to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict 
      post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its 
      association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in 
      one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 
      kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two 
      radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa 
      et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The mismatching results were 
      repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and 
      carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry 
      before and one year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and 
      cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1 year. We found out that eGFR(1year) 
      correlated with eGFR(discharge) and calcium based on hospital discharge data 
      (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFR(discharge) 
      (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR(1year) than AoAC combined with 
      recipient eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four 
      (10.81%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV 
      ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In 
      conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE 
      rate within 1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray 
      together with recipient eGFR(discharge) could be related to kidney function in 
      one-year follow-up.

TI  - Impact of Renal Functional/Morphological Dynamics on the Calcification of Coronary 
      and Abdominal Arteries in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1092-1104
LID - 10.5551/jat.39271 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Fast-progressing vascular calcification (VC) is accompanied by renal atrophy 
      and functional deterioration along with atherosclerosis in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). However, the relationship between VC progression and renal 
      functional and/or morphological changes remains unclear. METHODS: We included 70 
      asymptomatic patients with CKD without hemodialysis in our study. To identify 
      temporal variations, the coronary artery calcification score (CACS), abdominal 
      aortic calcification index (ACI), and renal parenchymal volume index (RPVI) were 
      determined via spiral computed tomography scans taken during the study. We 
      investigated significant factors related to annualized variations of CACS (ΔCACS/y) 
      and ACI (ΔACI/y). RESULTS: During the follow-up period (4.6 years), median values of 
      CACS [in Agatston units (AU)] and ACI increased from 40.2 to 113.3 AU (p=0.053) and 
      from 13.2 to 21.7% (p=0.036), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that CACS 
      at baseline (p＜0.001) and diabetes mellitus (DM) status (p=0.037) for ΔCACS/y and 
      ACI at baseline (p=0.017) and hypertension (HT) status (p= 0.046) for ΔACI/y were 
      significant independent predictors. Furthermore, annualized RPVI variation was 
      significantly related to both ΔCACS/y and ΔACI/y (R=-0.565, p＜0.001, and R=-0.289, 
      p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, independent contributions of the 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and annualized eGFR variation to VC 
      progression were not confirmed. CONCLUSION: The degree of VC at baseline, DM, HT, 
      and changes in renal volume, but not eGFR, had a strong impact on VC progression in 
      patients with CKD.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast 
      activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent data indicate 
      that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet 
      receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was 
      assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to 
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin 
      levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
      determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. 
      Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) 
      (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of 
      AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin 
      levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher 
      body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower 
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In 
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history 
      (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
      determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that 
      patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
      multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
      experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
      protects against progression of vascular calcification.

TI  - Effect Modification of Chronic Kidney Disease on the Association of Circulating and 
      Imaging Cardiac Biomarkers With Outcomes.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.116.005235 [doi]
LID - e005235
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin T and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are elevated in 
      >50% of dialysis patients and are associated with poor outcomes. Few data 
      investigated these associations in earlier chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We studied whether CKD modified associations of elevated BNP, 
      N-terminal-pro-BNP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, coronary artery 
      calcification, and left ventricular hypertrophy with all-cause death and 
      cardiovascular death/events in 3218 multiethnic individuals followed for 12.5 years, 
      and whether biomarkers added prognostic information to traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors in CKD. Of the cohort, 279 (9%) had CKD. There were 296 deaths and 218 
      cardiovascular deaths/events. Of non-CKD individuals, 7% died and 6% had 
      cardiovascular death/event versus 32% and 30% of CKD participants, P<0.001 for both. 
      The interaction between BNP and CKD on death was significant (P=0.01): the adjusted 
      hazard ratio in CKD was 2.05, 95% CI (1.34, 3.14), but not significant in non-CKD, 
      1.04 (0.76, 1.41). CKD modified the association of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 
      T with cardiovascular death/event, adjusted hazard ratio 3.34 (1.56, 7.18) in CKD 
      versus 1.65 (1.16, 2.35) in non-CKD, interaction P=0.09. There was an interaction 
      between N-terminal-pro-BNP and CKD for death in those without prior cardiovascular 
      disease. Addition of each biomarker to traditional risk factors improved risk 
      prediction, except coronary artery calcification was not discriminatory for 
      cardiovascular death/event in CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac biomarkers, with the 
      exception of coronary artery calcification, prognosticated outcomes in early-stage 
      CKD as well as, if not better than, in non-CKD individuals, even after controlling 
      for estimated glomerular filtration rate, and added to information obtained from 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors alone.

TI  - Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1758-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard for 
      evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less 
      costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries 
      has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome 
      predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in 
      predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance 
      hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. METHODS: Four 
      hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic 
      radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the 
      methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were 
      followed prospectively for 5 years. RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with 
      the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT 
      (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher 
      prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and 
      eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, 
      whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function 
      and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 
      as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, 
      whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all 
      three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, 
      whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. 
      Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, 
      serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but 
      not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients. CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting 
      mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed 
      the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray 
      examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
      biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients 
      with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited 
      lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
      associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
      AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
      dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
      circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were independently associated with AoAC.

TI  - Effects of Lanthanum Carbonate on Coronary Artery Calcification and Cardiac 
      Abnormalities After Initiating Hemodialysis.
PG  - 310-320
LID - 10.1007/s00223-017-0347-3 [doi]
AB  - It is known that calcium-containing phosphate binders are more closely associated 
      with the progression of vascular calcification than non-calcium-containing phosphate 
      binders. In this study, we investigated the effect of the non-calcium-containing 
      phosphate binder, lanthanum carbonate on the progression of coronary artery 
      calcification and cardiovascular abnormalities compared to that of 
      calcium-containing phosphate binder in chronic kidney disease patients during the 
      early period after initiating hemodialysis. This was a randomized open-label study 
      in which patients were divided into the calcium carbonate or lanthanum carbonate 
      group. We evaluated blood samples, coronary artery calcification using 
      high-resolution computed tomography, and cardiac abnormalities using 
      echocardiography prior to and after initiating hemodialysis. Cardiac dimension and 
      systolic function were significantly improved in the lanthanum carbonate group 
      compared to those in the calcium carbonate group. Although statistically significant 
      differences were not observed in all the patients, only among patients with moderate 
      coronary artery calcification, the changes in coronary artery calcification score at 
      18 months were significantly smaller in the lanthanum carbonate group than those in 
      the calcium carbonate group. The percent change in coronary artery calcification at 
      18 months was significantly correlated with the serum fibroblast growth factor 23 
      levels at 18 months (r = 0.245, P < 0.05). This significant correlation was 
      particularly strong in patients with moderate coronary artery calcification 
      (r = 0.593, P < 0.001). Our study suggests that lanthanum carbonate ameliorates 
      cardiac abnormalities, and may slow coronary artery calcification development in 
      patients with moderate coronary artery calcification, during the early period 
      following hemodialysis initiation.

TI  - Calcification in arteriovenous fistula blood vessels may predict arteriovenous 
      fistula failure: a 5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 881-887
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1515-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for 
      hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains 
      unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the 
      light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification 
      process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the 
      calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity. METHODS: The 
      study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a 
      mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent 
      primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic 
      region was detected using X-ray examination. RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood 
      vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis 
      demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of 
      AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of 
      AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these 
      standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels 
      calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 
      (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications of 
      AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize 
      the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method 
      for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be 
      monitored more closely.

TI  - Abdominal aorta calcification predicts cardiovascular but not non-cardiovascular 
      outcome in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: A prospective cohort study.

AB  - Abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) is associated with worse clinical outcomes in 
      dialysis patients. However, the long-term prognostic values of AAC to cardiovascular 
      (CV) and non-CV mortality in patients starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain 
      unknown. This study is aimed to the analyze the predictive power of AAC to CV and 
      non-CV mortality in PD patients. We prospectively enrolled 123 patients undergoing 
      PD. All patients received quantitative analysis of AAC via abdominal computer 
      tomography at enrollment. The AAC ratio was measured by the area of the whole aorta 
      affected by aortic calcification above the iliac bifurcation. The CV mortality and 
      non-CV mortality during the follow-up period were investigated using the Cox 
      proportional hazard model and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      analysis. After median 6.8 (interquartile range, 3.6-9.2) years of follow-up, there 
      were 18 CV mortality, 24 non-CV mortality and 42 total mortality. The age and AAC 
      ratio were significantly higher in CV mortality group compared with others without 
      CV mortality. In time-dependent ROC analysis, AAC had excellent predictive power of 
      CV mortality (AUC:0.787) but not non-CV mortality (AUC:0.537). The best cutoff value 
      of AAC ratio to predict CV mortality was 39%. In addition, AAC was not associated 
      with non-CV mortality but remained to be a significantly predictor of CV mortality 
      after adjusted with clinical covariates in different Cox proportional hazard models. 
      AAC has excellent prognostic value of CV mortality but is unable to predict non-CV 
      morality in patients undergoing PD.

TI  - Albuminuria Changes and Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes: The 
      DCCT/EDIC Study.
PG  - 1969-1977
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In trials of people with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria 
      reduction with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is associated with lower risks of 
      cardiovascular events and CKD progression. We tested whether progression or 
      remission of microalbuminuria is associated with cardiovascular and renal risk in a 
      well characterized cohort of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: We studied 1441 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications 
      Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. Albumin 
      excretion rate (AER) was quantified annually or biennially for up to 30 years. For 
      each participant, albuminuria status was defined over time as normoalbuminuria (AER 
      continuously <30 mg/d), sustained microalbuminuria (AER, 30-299 mg/d on two 
      consecutive visits), macroalbuminuria (AER≥300 mg/d), or remitted microalbuminuria 
      (transition from sustained microalbuminuria to AER<30 mg/d on two consecutive 
      visits). We tested associations of time-updated albuminuria status with adjudicated 
      clinical cardiovascular events, the development of reduced GFR (<60 ml/min per 1.73 
      m(2) on two consecutive visits), and subclinical cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: At 
      least one cardiovascular event occurred in 184 participants, and 98 participants 
      developed reduced eGFR. Compared with normoalbuminuria, sustained microalbuminuria, 
      remitted microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria were each associated with higher 
      risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence 
      intervals [95% CIs]: 1.79 [1.13 to 2.85], 2.62 [1.68 to 4.07], and 2.65 [1.68 to 
      4.19], respectively) and reduced eGFR (adjusted HRs [95% CIs], 5.26 [2.43 to 11.41], 
      4.36 [1.80 to 10.57], and 54.35 [30.79 to 95.94], respectively). Compared with 
      sustained microalbuminuria, remission to normoalbuminuria was not associated with 
      reduced risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.68 to 2.59) or 
      reduced eGFR (adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.56 to 5.49). Compared with 
      normoalbuminuria, sustained microalbuminuria, remitted microalbuminuria, and 
      macroalbuminuria were associated with greater carotid intima-media thickness, and 
      macroalbuminuria was associated with a greater degree of coronary artery 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetes, microalbuminuria and 
      macroalbuminuria are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and 
      reduced eGFR, but achieving a remission of established microalbuminuria to 
      normoalbuminuria does not appear to improve outcomes.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification and renal resistive index in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease: is there a connection?
PG  - 173-9
LID - 10.1007/s40620-013-0021-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) and renal resistive index (RRI), parameters associated with 
      cardiovascular outcome, in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. 
      METHODS: Seventy-seven stable patients mainly in CKD stages 3B and 4 (44 and 28%), 
      median age 69 years, with a positive history of systemic atherosclerosis were 
      prospectively enrolled. RRI, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), Kauppila score 
      for AAC (AACs), cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) 
      were assessed. Traditional and non-traditional atherosclerosis risk factors were 
      also evaluated. RESULTS: Vascular (50%), diabetic (26%) and primary glomerular 
      nephropathies (8 %) were the main causes of CKD. AAC was highly prevalent (77%). In 
      the whole cohort, RRI was directly related to AACs (rs = 0.35, p < 0.001). AACs 
      correctly identified patients with RRI >0.7 in 69% (56-81%) of cases, a cut-off of 5 
      resulting the best combination of sensitivity (65%) and specificity (68%). Compared 
      to those with AACs <5, patients with AACs >5 were older, had higher serum 
      cholesterol, C-reactive protein and IMT, lower ABI, but similar CAVI, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, serum calcium and phosphate. In the whole cohort, AACs 
      was negatively correlated with ABI (rs = -0.51, p < 0.001) and positively with IMT 
      (rs = 0.27, p = 0.01), supporting a role for Kauppila score in integrating 
      information on both intra- and extrarenal atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: As Kauppila 
      score correlates with RRI in non-dialysis CKD patients, it could be a fast, 
      convenient and relatively inexpensive tool for estimating RRI, and consequently the 
      intrarenal vascular status, but further research is warranted.

TI  - Serum sclerostin: the missing link in the bone-vessel cross-talk in hemodialysis 
      patients?
PG  - 2165-74
LID - 10.1007/s00198-015-3127-9 [doi]
AB  - We found for the first time that in maintenance hemodialysis patients, higher 
      sclerostin serum level was associated with severe abdominal aortic calcification 
      (AAC). In addition, cortical bone microarchitecture (density and thickness) assessed 
      by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at tibia 
      was also independently associated with severe AAC. These results suggest that 
      sclerostin may be involved in the association of mineral and bone disorder with 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. INTRODUCTION: Severe abdominal 
      aortic calcifications are predictive of high cardiovascular mortality in maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients. In patients with end-stage renal disease, a high aortic 
      calcification score was associated with lower bone turnover on bone biopsies. Thus, 
      we hypothesized that sclerostin, a Wnt pathway inhibitor mainly secreted by 
      osteocytes and acting on osteoblasts to reduce bone formation, may be associated 
      with vascular calcifications in MHD patients. METHODS: Fifty-three MHD patients, 
      aged 53 years [35-63] (median [Q1-Q3]) were included. Serum was sampled before the 
      MHD session to assay sclerostin. Framingham score was computed and the abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) score was assessed according to Kauppila method on 
      lateral spine imaging using DEXA. Tibia bone status was evaluated by high-resolution 
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Patients were distributed 
      into two groups according to their AAC score: patients with mild or without AAC 
      (score below 6) versus patients with severe AAC (score of 6 and above). RESULTS: In 
      multivariate analysis, after adjustment on age, dialysis duration and diabetes, 
      serum sclerostin and cortical thickness were independently associated with severe 
      AAC (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43 for each 0.1 ng/mL increase [95 % confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.10-1.83]; p = 0.006 and 0.16 for 1 SD increase [0.03-0.73]; p = 0.018, 
      respectively). A second cardiovascular model adjusted on Framingham score and the 
      above mentioned confounders showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated sclerostin 
      serum level and poorer tibia cortical bone structure by HR-pQCT were positively and 
      independently associated with higher odds of severe AAC in MHD patients. Serum 
      sclerostin may become a biomarker of mineral and bone disorder and vascular risk in 
      MHD patients.

TI  - Mismatch between stiffness in elastic and muscular arteries as a predictor of 
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 375-382
LID - 10.1007/s40520-017-0787-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is one of the risk factors for arterial stiffness 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that a mismatch between 
      elastic and muscular arteries, represented as pulse wave velocity (PWV) ratio, could 
      depict the extent of vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease. We also 
      aimed to compare the predictive PWV ratio value to other factors possibly related to 
      vascular calcification in dialysis population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, in 60 chronic dialysis patients without previous cerebrovascular events, 
      cardiovascular disease and events or clinically evident peripheral artery disease 
      (ankle-brachial index >0.9), carotid-femoral and carotid-radial PWV as well as 
      central hemodynamic parameters were measured by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor). 
      The PWV ratio using carotid-femoral PWV divided by carotid-radial PWV was 
      calculated. Each patient underwent blood tests and chest X-ray for aortic arch 
      calcification scoring. Two experienced radiologists blinded to patient's medical 
      data evaluated chest X-rays (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.76) and calculated how many 
      sectors were calcified (Ogawa et al. in Hemodial Int 13:301-306, 2009). Differently 
      scored chest X-rays were repeatedly reviewed and a consensus was reached. RESULTS: 
      The study population consisted of 31 (51.7%) males and 29 (48.3%) females, mean age 
      52.73 ± 13.76 years. Increased risk for aortic arch calcification was associated 
      with higher PWV ratio even after adjustment for age, height, heart rate, ferritin 
      level and C-reactive protein level (OR 2.59E+04, 95% CI 2.43E+01, 2.65E+09, 
      p = 0.021). PWV ratio together with above-mentioned variables could predict the 
      presence of aortic arch calcification with specificity of 93% (95% CI 78, 99%) and 
      sensitivity of 53% (95% CI 34, 72%). CONCLUSION: The elastic and muscular arteries' 
      stiffness mismatch was strongly associated with the extent of aortic arch 
      calcification in this dialysis population and had better calcification predictive 
      value compared to other demographic, hemodynamic and biochemical markers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A functioning and reliable arteriovenous fistula is a lifeline for 
      individuals suffering from chronic kidney disease. The success and failure to 
      arteriovenous fistula maturation have been frequently related to patient and surgeon 
      factors. METHOD: In total, 138 participants with stage IV and V chronic kidney 
      disease were included in this prospective observational study. Preoperative vascular 
      mapping using ultrasound was performed to evaluate the condition and size of the 
      vessels to fulfil the inclusion criteria. Intraoperatively, the vessel size was 
      measured prior to anastomosis under magnified view. A specimen from the arterial 
      wall of 5 mm in diameter was obtained from the arterotomy for histopathology 
      assessment. Arteriovenous maturation was assessed at 6 weeks with the guidance of 
      the ultrasound criteria of rule of sixes. RESULTS: From the total of 138 
      participants, 110 participants (79.7%) had matured arteriovenous fistula in 6 weeks. 
      The mean size of the artery measured intraoperatively was 3.82 ± 1.33 mm and the 
      vein was 4.05 ± 1.20 mm. Microcalcification in the arterial media which was 
      hypothesised to be the cause of the arteriovenous fistula failure was insignificant, 
      with a p value of 0.115. Despite having atherosclerosis in the artery, 83.3% of the 
      arteriovenous fistula matured. CONCLUSION: Microcalcification and atherosclerosis 
      are frequently seen in the arteries of chronic kidney disease patients, but they do 
      not explain arteriovenous fistula non-maturation.

TI  - Activation of the mTORC1 pathway by inflammation contributes to vascular 
      calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 101-110
LID - 10.1007/s40620-018-0486-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the progression of 
      vascular calcification (VC). This study was designed to explore the effects and 
      underlying mechanisms of inflammation on VC in the radial arteries of patients with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with arteriovenostomy. METHODS: Forty-eight ESRD 
      patients were divided into control (n = 25) and inflammation groups (n = 23) 
      according to plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Surgically removed tissues from 
      the radial arteries of patients receiving arteriovenostomy were used in this study. 
      Alizarin Red S staining was used to examine calcium deposition. The expression of 
      inflammation markers, bone structure-associated proteins and mammalian target of 
      rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) pathway-related proteins was assessed by 
      immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α 
      (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) was increased in the radial 
      arteries of the inflammation group. Additionally, Alizarin Red S staining revealed a 
      marked increase in calcium deposition in the inflammation group compared to 
      controls. Further analysis by immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the 
      deposition was correlated with the increased expression of bone-associated proteins 
      such as bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin and collagen I, which 
      suggested that inflammation induces osteogenic differentiation in vascular tissues 
      and that osteogenic cells are the main cellular components involved in VC. 
      Interestingly, there was a parallel increase in the expression of phosphorylated 
      mTOR (p-mTOR) and pribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p-S6K1) in the inflammation group. 
      Furthermore, mTORC1 pathway-related proteins were significantly associated with the 
      enhanced expression of bone formation biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation 
      contributed to VC in the radial arteries of ESRD patients via the induction of 
      osteogenic differentiation in vessel walls, which could be regulated by the 
      activation of the mTORC1 pathway.

PG  - 21-7

AB  - The increased vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has been associated with disturbances in 
      mineral-bone metabolism. In order to determine markers of the vascular calcification 
      frequently observed in these patients, blood samples of elderly male and female 
      hemodialysis CKD patients were used to measure serum levels of: osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG), total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (sRANKL), and 
      fetuin-A by enzyme immunoassay; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP-5b), and 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) by immunoenzymometric assay; osteocalcin 
      (OC) by ELISA; iPTH by immunoradiometric assay; 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), by 
      I(125) radioimmunoassay; and calcium and phosphorus by photometric assay. Serum OPG, 
      BAP, iPTH, phosphorus, and OC levels were higher and serum 25(OH)D(3), 
      1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and fetuin-A levels lower in both male and female CKD patients than 
      in their respective controls. Our results indicate that the bone formation and 
      resorption parameters are altered in elderly male and female hemodialysis CKD 
      patients. These changes may lead to vascular calcifications and cardiovascular 
      complications, given that elevated OPG and OC levels and reduced fetuin-A levels are 
      associated with cardiovascular events.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and associated 
      factors of carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 309 panoramic 
      radiographs of patients with CKD (180 men and 129 women; mean age 43.7 years) 
      undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated by a single radiologist to determine the 
      frequency of CAC. An analysis of associated factors, such as age, sex, time spent in 
      hemodialysis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, biochemical parameters, and 
      other systemic diseases, was also performed. RESULTS: The presence of CAC in 
      patients with CKD, as determined on the basis of panoramic radiography, was 15.9%. 
      The χ(2) test revealed that there was a statistically significant association 
      between certain factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, and the presence 
      of CAC (P < .05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that time spent in hemodialysis 
      was significantly associated with the occurrence of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant 
      presence of CAC was detected on digital panoramic radiographs in patients with CKD 
      undergoing hemodialysis. Calcification was more frequent in older patients, women, 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus, and patients who had undergone hemodialysis for 
      longer periods.

TI  - Effect of Sodium Thiosulfate on Arterial Stiffness in End-Stage Renal Disease 
      Patients Undergoing Chronic Hemodialysis (Sodium Thiosulfate-Hemodialysis Study): A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 219-227
LID - 10.1159/000488009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness (AS) and vascular calcification are significantly 
      related to a high cardiovascular mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (IV STS) can prevent and delay the vascular 
      calcification progression in uremic states; however, the STS effect on AS has not 
      been assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the STS efficacy on vascular 
      calcification and AS in HD patients. METHODS: Fifty HD patients with abnormal AS, as 
      measured via the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI ≥8), were prospectively 
      randomized to open-label 12.5 g IV STS during the last HD hour twice weekly for 6 
      months (n = 24) or the usual care (control group; n = 26). Patients and treating 
      physicians were not blinded. The CAVI, coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, 
      hemodynamics, and biochemical parameters were measured at the baseline and at 3 and 
      6 months. RESULTS: All the baseline parameters were comparable. The IV STS 
      significantly reduced the CAVI when compared to the control group (mean CAVI 
      difference = -0.53; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.06; p = 0.03). A significant CAVI improvement 
      was seen in those patients without diabetes mellitus. The natural logarithm of the 
      CAC volume score was significantly increased in the control group. The high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein level was slightly lowered in the IV STS group (not 
      significant). CONCLUSION: The intradialytic STS treatment significantly reduced the 
      AS, as measured by the CAVI, and stabilized the vascular calcification in the HD 
      patients. STS may be a novel therapeutic strategy for delaying and treating the 
      structural and functional vascular wall abnormalities in HD patients.

PG  - 489-496
LID - 10.1536/ihj.17-351 [doi]
AB  - Serum indoxyl sulfate (IS; a uremic toxin) levels, which are significantly higher in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease, including those undergoing hemodialysis, than 
      in the robust, are associated with both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related 
      mortality. Furthermore, coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to 
      interpret the association between serum IS levels and coronary plaque burden (CPB) 
      or CAC.A total of 30 consecutive patients on hemodialysis, who underwent 320-row 
      coronary multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography for suspected coronary 
      artery disease, were enrolled in this prospective study. Coronary artery percent 
      atheroma volume (a CPB marker) and percent calcium volume (a CAC marker) assessed 
      using MDCT were evaluated. Furthermore, various oxidative and inflammatory markers 
      typified by serum IS levels at a dialysis-free day were measured. Using these data, 
      we investigated correlation between the inflammatory marker IS and CPB or 
      CAC.Multivariable analysis indicated that serum IS levels were positively correlated 
      with CAC [partial regression coefficient, 2.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      0.35-5.43; P = 0.03] but not with CPB, even after adjustment for cofounders. 
      Composite cardiovascular events, namely, as all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction, disabling stroke, and hospital admission for other cardiovascular 
      events, were reported to be 50% in all patients (95% CI, 32.1-67.9).In patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis, serum IS levels were significantly associated with CAC but 
      not with CPB.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an important predictor 
      of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, 
      little is known regarding AAC progression in these patients. This study aimed to 
      identify risk factors associated with AAC progression in patients with CKD without 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: We recruited 141 asymptomatic patients with CKD without 
      hemodialysis [median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
      40.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] and evaluated the progression of the abdominal aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) over 3 years. To identify risk factors contributing to the 
      rate of ACI progression, the associations between baseline clinical characteristics 
      and annual change in ACI for each CKD category were analyzed. The annual change of 
      ACI (ΔACI/year) was calculated as follows: (second ACI - first ACI)/duration between 
      the two evaluations. RESULTS: Median ΔACI/year values significantly increased in 
      advanced CKD stages (0.73%, 0.87%, and 2.24%/year for CKD stages G1-2, G3, and G4-5, 
      respectively; p for trend = 0.041). The only independent risk factor for AAC 
      progression in mild to moderate CKD (G1-3, eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was pulse 
      pressure level (β = 0.258, p = 0.012). In contrast, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level 
      was significantly correlated with ΔACI/year (β = 0.426, p = 0.007) among patients 
      with advanced CKD (G4-5, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      suggests that the AAC progression rate was significantly accelerated in patients 
      with advanced CKD. In addition, measuring PTH is useful to evaluate both bone 
      turnover and AAC progression in patients with advanced CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be associated with vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing dialysis through hypomagnesemia. However, only 
      few studies have demonstrated the influence of PPIs on vascular calcification in 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). This study aimed to investigate whether 
      the use of PPIs accelerates vascular calcification in patients on HD. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 200 HD patients who underwent regular blood 
      tests and computed tomography (CT) between 2016 and 2017. The abdominal aortic 
      calcification index (ACI) was measured using abdominal CT. The difference in the ACI 
      values between 2016 and 2017 was evaluated as ΔACI. Patients were divided into PPI 
      and non-PPI groups, and variables, such as patient background, medication, 
      laboratory data, and ΔACI were compared. Factors independently associated with 
      higher ΔACI progression (≥ third tertile value of ΔACI in this study) were 
      determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The PPI and 
      non-PPI groups had 112 (56%) and 88 (44%) patients, respectively. Median and third 
      tertile value of ΔACIs were 4.2% and 5.8%, respectively. Serum magnesium was 
      significantly lower in the PPI (2.1 mg/dL) than in the non-PPI (2.3 mg/dL) group (P 
      <0.001). Median ΔACI was significantly higher in the PPI (5.0%) than in the non-PPI 
      (3.8%) group (P = 0.009). A total of 77 (39%) patients had a higher ΔACI. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed that PPIs (odds ratio = 2.23; 95% confidence interval 
      = 1.11-4.49), annual mean calcium phosphorus product, ACI in 2016, baseline serum 
      magnesium levels, and HD vintage were independent factors associated with higher 
      ΔACI progression after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: PPI use may accelerate 
      vascular calcification in patients on HD. Further studies are necessary to elucidate 
      their influence on vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a predictor of poor survival and 
      cardiovascular outcome in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; however, there is 
      scarce information of VC in Latin America, and virtually no data in our setting. We 
      undertook this study to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of VC in a 
      hemodialysis (HD) population from western Mexico and to determine possible 
      associated factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed in 52 
      patients. VC was evaluated using plain X-ray films (Adragao's score) of hands and 
      pelvis; clinical and biochemical variables were also collected. Statistical analysis 
      was carried out with Student t and χ(2) tests performed as appropriate and logistic 
      regression to determine predictors of VC. RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years, 48% were 
      female, 23% had diabetes mellitus (DM), and median time on dialysis was 46 months. 
      Percentage prevalence was 52% with a mean calcification score of 2.0 ± 2.6; 23% of 
      patients had severe calcification. VC was present in about 23-37% among the 
      different vascular territories evaluated (radial, digital, femoral and iliac). 
      Patients with calcification were significantly older, had a higher frequency of DM, 
      higher alkaline phosphatase and lower HDL lipoproteins than those without VC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, VC in these patients was significantly predicted only by an 
      older age (OR [95% CI]: 1.15 [1.01-1.31], p = 0.04); lower HDL-cholesterol and 
      higher alkaline phosphatase were marginal predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Half of our HD 
      patients had VC. Territories of radial, iliac, femoral and digital arteries were 
      roughly equally affected, and 25% of patients had a calcification considered as 
      severe. Older age was the only significant predicting variable for VC, with low 
      HDL-cholesterol and high alkaline phosphatase as marginal predictors.

AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in predialysis CKD patients and patients on 
      hemodialysis (HD) and to study the risk factors associated with it. In this 
      prospective study, 205 patients were including 104 patients with predialysis CKD and 
      101 patients were on maintenance hemodialysis. AAC was assessed using lateral lumbar 
      radiography. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, 
      highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and total cholesterol were analyzed. AAC 
      was observed in 26 % of predialysis CKD patients and 34% in HD patients. Using 
      multivariate analysis, the age (P = 0.001) was identified as independent predictor 
      for the presence of AAC in predialysis patients, and for HD, the predictors were age 
      (P = 0.025), time on dialysis (P = 0.001), hsCRP (P = 0.002), and corrected calcium 
      (P = 0.030). In conclusion, the prevalence of AAC varies mainly with age and 
      glomerular filtration rate levels in predialysis CKD patients. Advanced age, time on 
      dialysis, and inflammation may be associated with presence and extent of AAC in HD 
      patients. Further research into the risk factors and outcome for AAC is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Presence and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      indicate severe atherosclerosis and predict cardiovascular events (CVE) in dialysis 
      (ESRD patients) and nondialysis patients (CKD patients). This study aimed at 
      evaluating the prevalence and progression of CAC and CVE in CKD patients with 
      diabetes in whom atherosclerosis of coronary arteries is the leading cause of CVE. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted in both out- and in-patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, stage 2-5. CAC were assessed by the total calcium (TC) 
      score. CT scans were performed at the entry and at the end of the study. RESULTS: 
      Patients (n = 341) were divided into nondiabetic (n = 281) and diabetic patients (n 
      = 60). CAC prevalence and TC score were higher in diabetics and associated with age, 
      diabetes mellitus and pulse pressure. Diabetics with CKD presented a higher 
      percentage of CAC progression and CVE. CONCLUSION: Prevalence, extent, progression 
      of CAC and CVE are higher in diabetics with concomitant CKD. These findings may 
      promote a more aggressive protocol of screening and care in type 2 diabetics with 
      concomitant CKD.

TI  - Two years of maintenance hemodialysis has a pronounced effect on arterial stiffness 
      progression.
PG  - 193-199
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-0971-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The change of aortic stiffness, but not the particular baseline value, 
      plays a crucial role in estimating the patient risk with end-stage renal disease. 
      Therefore, we aimed to analyze the evolution of central and peripheral arterial 
      stiffness in hemodialysis population without previous cardiovascular events during a 
      2-year follow-up. METHODS: 60 hemodialysis patients (mean age 57.61 ± 13.01 years) 
      were prospectively interviewed, and they underwent blood tests, chest X-ray for 
      aortic calcification evaluation and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements at the 
      baseline, after 6 months and after 2 years of observation period. RESULTS: We found 
      significant progression of aortic PWV (12.73 vs. 14.24 m/s, p = 0.032) and 
      regression of brachial PWV (11.53 vs. 8.85 m/s, p < 0.001). CRP increase influenced 
      evolution of aortic PWV (β = 0.331, p = 0.031, R(2) = 0.599). Higher 
      β2-microglobulin values was related to the progression of aortic PWV (β = 0.219, 
      p = 0.022, R(2) = 0.568). Mean arterial blood pressure had influence only on the 
      short-term arterial stiffness evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis experience pronounced changes of arterial stiffness during the 2-year 
      follow-up period. The progression of aortic stiffness is related to inflammatory 
      response and particularly is influenced by β2-microglobulin concentration and aortic 
      calcification.

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to 
      exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess 
      characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 
      124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent 
      patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were 
      compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. 
      Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, 
      and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area 
      stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean 
      calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3° 
      vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments 
      (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. 
      There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium 
      >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 
      4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the 
      HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial 
      calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, 
      HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more 
      extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of 
      non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an 
      overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to 
      the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with 
      long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.

TI  - The Predictive Value of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring for Major Adverse Cardiac

AB  - The prognostic performance of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for predicting 
      adverse outcomes in patients with decreased renal function remains unclear. We aimed 
      to examine whether CACS improves risk stratification by demonstrating incremental 
      value beyond a traditional risk score according to renal function status. 9,563 
      individuals without known coronary artery disease were enrolled. Estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was ascertained using the 
      modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, and was categorized as: ≥90, 
      60 to 89, and <60. CACS was categorized as 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400. 
      Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (95% CI) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), comprising 
      all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and late revascularization (>90 days). 
      Mean age was 55.8 ± 11.5 years (52.8% male). In total, 261 (2.7%) patients 
      experienced MACE over a median follow-up of 24.5 months (interquartile range: 16.9 
      to 41.1). Incident MACE increased with higher CACS across each eGFR category, with 
      the highest rate observed among patients with CACS >400 and eGFR <60 (95.1 per 1,000 
      person-years). A CACS >400 increased MACE risk with HR 4.46 (95% CI 1.68 to 11.85), 
      6.63 (95% CI 4.03 to 10.92), and 6.14 (95% CI 2.85 to 13.21) for eGFR ≥90, 60 to 89, 
      and <60, respectively, as compared with CACS 0. Further, CACS improved 
      discrimination and reclassification beyond Framingham 10-year risk score (FRS) (AUC: 
      0.70 vs 0.64; category free-NRI: 0.51, all p <0.001) for predicting MACE in patients 
      with impaired renal function (eGFR < 90). In conclusion, CACS improved risk 
      stratification and provided incremental value beyond FRS for predicting MACE, 
      irrespective of eGFR status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), and it is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
      mortality. Deoxycholic acid, a metabolite of circulating bile acids, is elevated in 
      CKD and induces vascular mineralization and osteogenic differentiation in animal 
      models. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of clinical trial participants. SETTING & 
      PARTICIPANTS: 112 patients with moderate to severe CKD (estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, 20-45mL/min/1.73m(2)) who participated in a randomized controlled 
      study to examine the effects of phosphate binders on vascular calcification. 
      PREDICTOR: Serum deoxycholic acid concentration. OUTCOMES: Baseline coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) volume score and bone mineral density (BMD) and change in CAC 
      volume score and BMD after 9 months. MEASUREMENTS: Deoxycholic acid was assayed in 
      stored baseline serum samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 
      CAC was measured using a GE-Imitron C150 scanner, and BMD was determined using 
      computed tomographic scans of the abdomen with calibrated phantom of known density. 
      RESULTS: Higher serum deoxycholic acid concentrations were significantly correlated 
      with greater baseline CAC volume and lower baseline BMD. After adjusting for 
      demographics, coexisting illness, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, and concentrations of circulating markers of mineral metabolism, including 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth 
      factor 23, a serum deoxycholic acid concentration > 58ng/mL (the median) was 
      positively associated with baseline CAC volume (β=0.71; 95% CI, 0.26-1.16; P=0.003) 
      and negatively associated with baseline BMD (β = -20.3; 95% CI, -1.5 to -39.1; 
      P=0.04). Serum deoxycholic acid concentration > 58ng/mL was not significantly 
      associated with change in CAC volume score after 9 months (β=0.06; 95% CI, -0.09 to 
      0.21; P=0.4). The analysis for the relationship between baseline deoxycholic acid 
      concentrations and change in BMD after 9 months was not statistically significant, 
      but was underpowered. LIMITATIONS: The use of nonfasting serum samples is a 
      limitation because deoxycholic acid concentrations may vary based on time of day and 
      dietary intake. Few trial participants with complete data to evaluate the change in 
      CAC volume score (n=75) and BMD (n=59). No data for changes in deoxycholic acid 
      concentrations over time. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with moderate to severe CKD, 
      higher serum deoxycholic acid concentrations were independently associated with 
      greater baseline CAC volume score and lower baseline BMD.

TI  - Study of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders in newly detected advanced 
      renal failure patients: A Hospital-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - 874-885
AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected, untreated 
      predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a tertiary care 
      hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational study. A total of 95 
      (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent clinical evaluation, 
      biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
      albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25- hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any abnormality including 
      fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular calcification (CVC)]. 
      Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 33.6% of the study 
      patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 
      hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. CVC was seen in 
      22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly involving the mitral valve. Patients 
      with CVC were more likely to be males and smokers. There was no significant 
      difference in iPTH levels between patients with or without CVC. AAC was seen in 
      10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray. Patients with AAC had higher levels of 
      iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels of calcium compared to patients without 
      AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in 41.05% of our patients and was more 
      prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 
      25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that newly detected, naïve Indian CKD patients have 
      a high prevalence of disturbances of mineral metabolism including

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mineral and bone disorder (MBD), especially hyperphosphatemia, is an 
      independently risk factor for adverse prognosis in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). However, CKD-MBD among Chinese population was poorly studied. This 
      study aimed to investigate the status of MBD and its association with cardiovascular 
      parameters in Chinese patients with predialysis CKD. METHODS: Chinese Cohort Study 
      of Chronic Kidney Disease (C-STRIDE) is a prospective multicenter cohort study 
      involving predialysis CKD patients in China. Markers of MBD, including serum 
      phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone, were measured in baseline 
      samples at the patients' entry. The association between serum phosphorus and 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were 
      examined by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Altogether 3194 predialysis 
      patients with mean estimated glomerular filtration of 51.8 ± 33.1 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2 
      were included. The proportion of patients with hyperphosphatemia were 2.6%, 2.9%, 
      6.8%, and 27.1% in CKD Stages 3a, 3b, 4, and 5, respectively. Moreover, 71.6% of the 
      patients with hyperphosphatemia did not receive any phosphate-binder (PB). Lateral 
      abdominal X-rays were obtained in 2280 patients, 9.8% of the patients were diagnosed 
      as having AAC. Altogether 2219 patients had data of echocardiography, and 13.2% of 
      them were diagnosed with LVH. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
      serum phosphorus was independently associated with the presence of AAC and LVH. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese patients with CKD, the percentage of hyperphosphatemia is 
      comparable to that of other countries while the usage of PBs is suboptimal. The 
      prevalence of vascular calcification in Chinese patients is relatively lower 
      compared with the Caucasian population.

TI  - High-Flux Hemodialysis Benefits Hemodialysis Patients by Reducing Serum FGF-23 
      Levels and Reducing Vascular Calcification.
PG  - 3467-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: High- and low-flux hemodialysis (HFHD and LFHD, respectively) are 
      dialysis procedures designed to eliminate blood toxins that accumulate in end-stage 
      renal disease. HFHD may reduce vascular calcification by removing serum fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 (FGF-23). However, whether HFHD is better than LFHD is still under 
      debate. We therefore compared the efficacy of HFHD and LFHD in controlling FGF-23 
      and vascular calcification. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty hemodialysis patients were 
      recruited and randomly treated with either HFHD or LFHD. Fasting venous blood was 
      collected at baseline, six months, and twelve months after the treatment. We then 
      measured levels of FGF-23, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline 
      phosphatase. Further, abdominal lateral radiographs were taken to calculate aorta 
      abdominalis calcification scores (AACs). RESULTS: Compared to the LFHD group, FGF-23 
      and AACs in the HFHD group significantly decreased after 12 months treatment 
      (p=0.049 and p=0.002, respectively). AACs were positively correlated with FGF-23 in 
      all patients (p=0.004), the HFHD group alone (p=0.040), and the LFHD group alone 
      (p=0.037). We also found that older patients, patients with higher blood phosphorus 
      levels, and higher FGF-23 levels had an increased risk of aorta abdominalis 
      calcification (p=0.048, p=0.003, p=0.001, respectively). HFHD was more able to 
      reduce the risk of aorta abdominalis calcification than LFHD (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: 
      FGF-23 is an independent risk factor for the development of vascular calcification. 
      HFHD may benefit hemodialysis patients by reducing serum FGF-23 levels and 
      controlling vascular calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes mellitus, 
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy are the most 
      commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true 
      visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To 
      date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. 
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: 
      Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy 
      subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice 
      multidetector computed tomography scanner. RESULTS: There were no differences in 
      age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between 
      healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT 
      measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with 
      nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant 
      relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48). 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS 
      in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy 
      subjects.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the role of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in 
      vascular calcification of patients with chronic hemodialysis. METHODS: The inferior 
      epigastric arteries were obtained from 23 patients on chronic haemodialysis and 16 
      patients with renal carcinoma as control. Haematoxylin-eosin staining, elastic fibre 
      staining, Alizarin Red calcium staining and immunohistochemical staining of PTHrP, 
      bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), Cbfa1/Runx2 were performed. Real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine mRNA expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 
      and Cbfa1/Runx2. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the effects of 
      PTHrP-siRNA and rh-PTHrP-1-34 on the expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 and Cbfa1/Runx2 in 
      human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and 
      intracellular calcium content in HASMCs were assessed after treatment with 10 mmol/L 
      β-glycerol phosphoric acid for 48 h. RESULTS: Vascular calcification was confirmed 
      in 78.2% of patients on chronic haemodialysis, and the expressions of PTHrP, BMP-2 
      and Cbfa1 in the arteries were significantly upregulated. PTHrP-siRNA could 
      downregulate the expression of PTHrP by 60%, BMP-2 by 25% and Cbfa1 by 25% at 24 h 
      (P < 0.05). Exogenous rh-PTHrP-1-34 could upregulate the expressions of BMP-2 and 
      Cbfa1 by 1.37-fold and 1.46-fold, respectively, at 24 h in a time-independent manner 
      (P < 0.05), which were attenuated by PTHrP-siRNA. Moreover, it could promote 
      intracellular calcium deposition and increase ALP activities, which were partially 
      blocked by PTHrP-siRNA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular calcification was common in 
      patients with chronic haemodialysis, to which PTHrP might contribute by activating 
      BMP-2/ Cbfa1 signalling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the most appropriate technique to diagnose 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. This is primarily because of the 
      absence of direct comparisons of predictive values of the various calcification 
      scores, especially outside the coronary vascular beds, to detect clinical outcomes. 
      METHODS: We included 93 haemodialysis patients and performed 6 vascular 
      calcification scores: two scores utilised simple X-rays of abdominal aorta and 
      peripheral vessels. CT scans of the thoracic, upper abdominal and lower abdominal 
      aorta were performed to calculate the aortic calcification index and CT of the 
      pelvis for calcification of iliac vessels. Patients were followed for 63months (mean 
      46.8months) for first major cardiovascular events and mortality. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      cardiovascular events and 28 deaths occurred. Calcification was detected more 
      sensitively in central and peripheral beds using CT scans compared to X-rays 
      (p<0.001). CT scans detected calcification more frequently in distal than proximal 
      vascular beds (p<0.001). Calcification of the pelvic vessels and lower abdominal 
      aorta were most predictive of events including pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
      O.R. 6.5 (95% C.I. 2-22; p=0.001) and O.R. 3 (95% C.I. 1.1-9; p=0.035); new major 
      cardiovascular events H.R. 4.2 (95% C.I. 1.5-11; p=0.006) and H.R. 2 (95% C.I. 
      0.8-5.3; p=0.1) as well as mortality H.R. 2.8 (95% C.I. 1.3-6; p=0.01) and H.R. 2.2 
      (95% C.I. 1.04-5; p=0.04) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CT based techniques are more 
      sensitive than plain X-rays at detecting peripheral and aortic vascular 
      calcifications. Distal CT scans of the aorta and pelvic vessels have the highest 
      predictive value for cardiovascular events and mortality.

AB  - AIM: Vascular stiffness is associated with cardiovascular mortality in dialysis 
      patients and related with vascular calcification and microvascular inflammation. The 
      objective of this study is to compare predictability of two different vascular 
      calcification scoring systems using plain radiographs in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients. METHODS: Vascular stiffness was represented by heart-to-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity (hfPWV) in our 79 PD patients. Peripheral vascular calcification score 
      (PVCS) and abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) were measured from plain 
      radiographs. Microvascular inflammation was represented by peritoneal protein 
      clearance (PPC). Regression analysis and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve analysis were used for analysis. RESULTS: The hfPWV revealed correlation with 
      PVCS and AACS independently. In the ROC curve analysis, area under the curve (AUC) 
      of PVC score was 0.7119 (P = 0.006), and AUC of AACS were 0.6960 (P = 0.011). After 
      multiple linear regression analysis, PVCS remained as a predictor of vascular 
      stiffness (R(2) = 0.579, β = 0.210, P = 0.038). The combination of PVCS and PPC 
      exhibited a trend toward better predictability for vascular stiffness (AUC 0.7738, P 
      = 0.001) than any of the two parameters alone. CONCLUSION: It is assumed that the 
      PVCS system is more predictable for vascular stiffness in our study. Moreover, the 
      combination of PVCS and PPC might be more useful as a screening test for vascular 
      stiffness.

TI  - The effect of magnesium supplementation on vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease-a randomised clinical trial (MAGiCAL-CKD): essential study design and 
      rationale.
PG  - e016795

LID - e016795
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality, which is thought to be caused by increased 
      propensity towards vascular calcification (VC). Magnesium (Mg) inhibits 
      phosphate-induced VC in vitro and in animal models and serum Mg is inversely 
      associated with cardiovascular mortality in predialysis CKD and in end-stage renal 
      disease. This paper will describe the design and rationale of a randomised 
      double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial, which will investigate 
      whether oral Mg supplementation can prevent the progression of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in subjects with predialysis CKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will 
      randomise 250 subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 
      45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 12 months treatment with either slow-release Mg hydroxide 
      30 mmol/day or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point is change in 
      CAC score as measured by CT at baseline and after 12 months treatment. Secondary end 
      points include change in pulse wave velocity, bone mineral density, measures of 
      mineral metabolism and clinical end points related to cardiovascular and renal 
      events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the local 
      biomedical research ethics committees and data protection agencies and will be 
      performed in accordance with the latest revision of the Helsinki Declaration. The 
      trial will examine for the first time the effect of increasing the uptake of a 
      putative VC inhibitor (ie, Mg) on progression of CAC in subjects with predialysis 
      CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02542319, pre-results.

TI  - Aberrant activation of Wnt pathways in arteries associates with vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to increased cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of vascular calcification in CKD patients 
      remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical association between 
      abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification in ESRD patients. 
      METHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples of 
      radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous fistula surgery. Expression of 
      Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association 
      between Wnt activities and vascular calcification rates. RESULTS: 
      Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that increased expressions of β-catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed in the subjects with vascular 
      calcification. Further correlation analysis identified that β-catenin expression in 
      overall arterial samples was significantly associated with the expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also found significant correlation between expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis demonstrated that Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular 
      calcification in patients with ESRD. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased 
      activation of Wnt pathways in the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is 
      significantly correlated with the incidence of vascular calcification. These 
      findings support Wnt pathways as a potential target for future therapy of vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

TI  - FGF23 is independently associated with vascular calcification but not bone mineral 
      density in patients at various CKD stages.
PG  - 2017-25
LID - 10.1007/s00198-011-1838-0 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: The hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is involved in mineral 
      homeostasis but may also have a role in vascular calcification and bone 
      mineralization. In a cohort of 142 patients with CKD stages 2-5D, plasma FGF23 was 
      independently associated with aortic calcification but not with pulse wave velocity 
      or bone mineral density. INTRODUCTION: FGF23 is involved in mineral homeostasis but 
      may also have a role in vascular calcification and bone mineralization. Previous 
      studies related to FGF23 and vascular and bone outcomes have been restricted to 
      dialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to establish whether or not 
      plasma FGF23 is associated with aortic and coronary calcification, arterial 
      stiffness, and bone mineral density in patients with early as well as late stages of 
      CKD. METHODS: In a cohort of 142 patients with CKD stages 2-5D, we made routine 
      biochemistry and intact FGF23 determinations, and assessed aortic and coronary 
      calcification, bone mineral density (BMD), and arterial stiffness by multislice 
      spiral computed tomography and automated pulse wave velocity (PWV). RESULTS: Plasma 
      intact FGF23 levels were elevated in CKD patients; the elevation preceded that of 
      serum phosphate in early-stage CKD. Patients with elevated FGF23 levels had higher 
      aortic and coronary calcification scores than patients with lower FGF23 levels. 
      Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that only age (p < 0.001) and 
      FGF23 (p = 0.008) were independently associated with aortic calcification score. 
      Plasma FGF23 was neither associated with PWV nor with BMD. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      suggest that plasma FGF23 is an independent biomarker of vascular calcification in 
      patients with various CKD stages including early stages. The association between 
      vascular calcification and FGF23 levels appears to be independent of BMD. It remains 
      to be seen whether this association is independent of bone turnover and bone mass.

TI  - Relationships between abdominal aortic calcification, glomerular filtration rate, 
      and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic 
      kidney disease .
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.5414/CN109441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an established risk factor for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized 
      that AAC is associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as 
      with some other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled clinical 
      trial (RENEXC). A total of 151 patients (aged 66 ± 14 years) with an average 
      measured GFR (mGFR) of 22.5 ± 8.2 mL/min/1.73m2, not on renal replacement therapy, 
      irrespective of number of comorbidities, were included. GFR was measured with 
      iohexol clearance and estimated using cystatin C- and creatinine-based equations 
      (eGFR). AAC was evaluated with lateral lumbar X-ray using the scoring system 
      described by Kauppila. All patients underwent laboratory analyses, 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and standard echocardiography. Multiple linear 
      regression analyses controlling for sex, age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and 
      hypertension were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of AAC in this group of 
      patients was 73%, and 47% had severe calcification (AAC score ≥ 7). More men (76%) 
      had AAC than women (69%). AAC score was associated with mGFR (p = 0.03), eGFR (p = 
      0.006), plasma albumin (p = 0.006), plasma phosphate (p = 0.01), pulse pressure (p = 
      0.004), left ventricular mass (LVM) (p = 0.02), left atrial volume (LAV; p < 0.001), 
      and left atrial volume index (LAVI; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: AAC was highly prevalent 
      in CKD. The degree of calcification in the abdominal aorta was strongly associated 
      with a decline in GFR, a decrease in plasma albumin, an increase in plasma 
      phosphate, an increase in pulse pressure, and cardiac structural changes, such as an 
      increase in LVM, LAV, and LAVI. .

TI  - Association of interleukin-6 with aortic stiffness in end-stage renal disease.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aortic stiffness, a nontraditional risk factor, is 
      associated with high rate of mortality in CKD. Using a CKD animal model with medial 
      vascular calcification, we previously reported increased mRNA expression of 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in 
      calcified aorta. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between 
      IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, and aortic stiffness in end-stage renal disease patients. In a 
      cross-sectional study, we enrolled 351 patients on dialysis. Aortic stiffness was 
      assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), while central pulse 
      pressure and augmentation index were assessed using generalized transfer function 
      applied to the radial artery pressure wave form. Plasma IL-6, TNF, and IL-1β were 
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 was associated with cf-PWV 
      adjusted for mean blood pressure (MBP) (standardized β = 0.270; P < .001). In a 
      multivariate adjusted model for age, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and MBP, IL-6 was 
      still associated with cf-PWV (standardized β = 0.096; P = .026). The impact of age, 
      diabetes, and CVD on cf-PWV was partially mediated by IL-6 in a mediation analysis. 
      However, there were no associations between TNF, IL-1β, and aortic stiffness. While 
      IL-6 was associated with augmentation index (standardized β = 0.224; P < .001) and 
      central pulse pressure (standardized β = 0.162; P = .001) when adjusted for MBP and 
      heart rate, this relationship was not significant after adjusting for potential 
      confounders.This study suggests a potential role of IL-6 for CKD-related aortic 
      stiffness.

TI  - Association of mineral content outside of bone with coronary artery calcium and 
      1-year cardiovascular prognosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 988-1001
LID - 10.1111/aor.13461 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery calcifications (CACs) are common among maintenance hemodialysis 
      (MHD) patients and associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to 
      cardiovascular events. The insight into chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone 
      disorder (CKD-MBD) established a correlation between dysregulated mineral metabolism 
      and CACs. This study aimed to identify the association of mineral content outside of 
      bone (MCOB) with CACs and cardiovascular events in MHD patients. In the pilot 
      prospective study with no intervention, patients underwent body composition 
      assessment by body composition monitor after hemodialysis and computed tomography 
      examination using the Agatston scoring method simultaneously within a week. The 
      primary end point included cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. 
      Correlations and receiver operating characteristic analysis elucidated the 
      associations of MCOB with CACs; multivariate analysis assessed the cardiovascular 
      risk for groups with different MCOB. One hundred three eligible patients with an 
      average age of 48 (35-63) years old were enrolled and followed up to 12 (11-12.5) 
      months, among which 52.4% had detectable CACs at baseline. MCOB showed an inverse 
      correlation with Agatston score and significantly discriminated the patients with 
      Agatston score > 0 (AUC = 0.737; P < 0.001) and 400 (AUC = 0.733; P < 0.001). MCOB 
      ≤ 9.2657 mg/kg was an independent risk factor for CACs (OR = 4.853; P = 0.044) and 
      strong predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (HR = 10.108; 
      P = 0.042), as well as rehospitalization (HR = 2.689; P = 0.004). MCOB inversely 
      correlated with the presence and extent of CACs, and could discriminate Agatston 
      score > 0 and 400, which also presented as an independent indicator for CKD-MBD and 
      1-year cardiovascular prognosis in adult MHD patients. Additional studies are 
      required for identifying this issue.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: In the general population lipid-rich plaques are prone to 
      rupture and healing of the plaque involves calcification. Patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis have a severe derangement of mineral metabolism and calcification of 
      the arterial tree may have different implications. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2005, 
      125 hemodialysis patients (60 men) underwent computed tomography imaging for 
      quantification of coronary artery calcium via the Agatston and the Volume methods. 
      Since the Agatston score is derived by multiplying the density by the volume of a 
      calcified lesion, the Agatston/Volume ratio (AVR) is an indication of the density 
      (i.e. calcium accumulation) within the plaque. RESULTS: Patients were classified as 
      high AVR (>1) or low (≤1) AVR. Survival analyses tested the association between AVR 
      and all-cause mortality during a median follow-up of 5 years. The mean age was 
      57.2±13.5 years; 75% of the patients had AVR >1. The mortality rate of patients with 
      AVR >1 was significantly higher than in patients with AVR ≤1 (Hazard Ratio(HR): 
      2.46; 95% Confidence Intervals(CI): 1.16-5.21, p ≤0.018). After adjustment for 
      confounders, AVR >1 remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 
      2.24; 95% CI: 1.02-4.88, p ≤0.042). There was a significant interaction of plaque 
      density and calcium volume on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Increased plaque density is an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. These data 
      suggest that increased calcium content in the coronary arteries of patients in 
      dialysis is an index of high-risk rather than a marker of plaque stabilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with mortality and cardiovascular 
      events in patients with chronic kidney disease. AST-120, which adsorbs uremic 
      toxins, is reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death in 
      chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate the 
      association between abdominal aortic calcification and the use of AST-120 in 
      predialysis chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was 
      conducted including 199 predialysis chronic kidney disease patients (stages 4 and 5) 
      who underwent abdominal plain computed tomography in our institution between 2005 
      and 2010. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by aortic calcification index 
      (ACI). Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not AST-120 was 
      administered for at least six months, and ACI was compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: The aortic calcification index was significantly lower in patients taking 
      AST-120 [12.2 (2.5-30.3) vs. 25.7 (13.4-45.3) %, P < 0.001]. According to 
      multivariate linear regression analysis, the use of AST-120 was independently and 
      significantly correlated with ACI after adjusting for confounding factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of AST-120 was independently associated with less aortic 
      calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.

AB  - Severe vascular calcification develops almost invariably in chronic kidney patients 
      posing a substantial risk to quality of life and survival. This unmet medical need 
      demands identification of novel therapeutic modalities. We aimed to pinpoint 
      components of the uremic microenvironment triggering differentiation of vascular 
      progenitors to calcifying osteoblast-like cells. In an unbiased approach, assessing 
      the individual potency of 63 uremic retention solutes to enhance calcific phenotype 
      conversion of vascular progenitor cells, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and 
      TNF-α were identified as the strongest inducers followed by FGF-2, and PTH. 
      Pharmacologic targeting of these molecules alone or in combination additively 
      antagonized pro-calcifying properties of sera from uremic patients. Our findings 
      stress the importance of pro-inflammatory cytokines above other characteristic 
      components of the uremic microenvironment as key mediators of calcifying 
      osteoblastic differentiation in vascular progenitors. Belonging to the group of 
      "middle-sized molecules", they are neither effectively removed by conventional 
      dialysis nor influenced by established supportive therapies. Specific pharmacologic 
      interventions or novel extracorporeal approaches may help preserve regenerative 
      capacity and control vascular calcification due to uremic environment.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients with nondialysis CKD over 3 years.
PG  - 654-66
LID - 10.2215/CJN.07450714 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in CKD, but little 
      is known about its prognostic effect on patients with nondialysis CKD. The 
      prevalence of VC and its ability to predict death, time to hospitalization, and 
      renal progression were assessed. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The 
      Study of Mineral and Bone Disorders in CKD in Spain is a prospective, observational, 
      3-year follow-up study of 742 patients with nondialysis CKD stages 3-5 from 39 
      centers in Spain from April to May 2009. VC was assessed using Adragao (AS; x-ray 
      pelvis and hands) and Kauppila (KS; x-ray lateral lumbar spine) scores from 572 and 
      568 patients, respectively. The primary end point was death. Secondary outcomes were 
      hospital admissions and appearance of a combined renal end point (beginning of 
      dialysis or drop >30% in eGFR). Factors related to VC were assessed by logistic 
      regression analysis. Survival analysis was assessed by Cox proportional models. 
      RESULTS: VC was present in 79% of patients and prominent in 47% (AS≥3 or KS>6). Age 
      (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.07; P<0.001), 
      phosphorous (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.20; P<0.001), and diabetes (OR, 2.11; 95% 
      CI, 1.32 to 3.35; P=0.002) were independently related to AS≥3. After a median 
      follow-up of 35 months (interquartile range=17-36), there were 70 deaths (10%). 
      After multivariate adjustment for age, smoking, diabetes, comorbidity, renal 
      function, and level of phosphorous, AS≥3 but not KS>6 was independently associated 
      with all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.01; P=0.03) and 
      cardiovascular (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.27 to 9.45; P=0.02) mortality as well as a 
      shorter hospitalization event-free period (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.22; P<0.001). 
      VC did not predict renal progression. CONCLUSIONS: VC is highly prevalent in 
      patients with CKD. VC assessment using AS independently predicts death and time to 
      hospitalization. Therefore, it could be a useful index to identify patients with CKD 
      at high risk of death and morbidity as previously reported in patients on dialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vascular calcification can predict cardiovascular (CV) morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the prevalence, 
      association factors, and outcomes of chest X-ray-detected aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We included 190 
      patients undergoing PD (mean age, 52.6 ± 14.3 years) for whom chest radiographs were 
      available. AoAC revealed by chest X-ray was graded from 0 to 3 according to an AoAC 
      score (AoACS). Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the factors 
      associated with AoACS. After adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      mean blood pressure, and history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading 
      and mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard 
      model. RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001), PD duration (p = 0.004), history of CV disease 
      (p < 0.001), and renal Kt/V (p = 0.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean 
      follow-up of 55.1 ± 32.1 months, patients with Grade 2 (p = 0.011) or Grade 3 
      (p < 0.001) AoAC had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In 
      addition, patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than 
      those with Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (p = 0.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.736; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; p = 0.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HR = 3.289; 95% 
      CI, 1.156-9.359; p = 0.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality after 
      adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HR = 36.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; 
      p = 0.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment. CONCLUSION: 
      In patients undergoing PD, CXR-detected severe AoAC was an independent risk factor 
      for all-cause and CV mortalities.

TI  - Histopathology of Veins Obtained at Hemodialysis Arteriovenous Fistula Creation 
      Surgery.

AB  - Stenosis from venous neointimal hyperplasia is common in native arteriovenous 
      fistulas (AVFs). However, the preexisting histologic characteristics of veins at 
      fistula creation, and associations thereof with baseline patient factors, have not 
      been well characterized. In this study, we conducted histologic analysis of a 
      segment of the vein used for anastomosis creation, obtained during AVF creation from 
      554 of the 602 participants in the multicenter Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation 
      Cohort Study. We quantified intimal and medial areas and lengths of the internal and 
      external elastic lamina by morphometry and assessed venous wall cells by 
      immunohistochemistry, extracellular matrix with Movat stain, and calcium deposition 
      by alizarin red stain. We also studied a representative subset of veins for markers 
      of monocyte/macrophage content, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and neoangiogenesis. 
      Neointima occupied >20% of the lumen in 57% of fully circumferential vein samples, 
      and neointimal hyperplasia associated positively with age and inversely with black 
      race. The neointima was usually irregularly thickened, sometimes concentric, and 
      contained α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells of smooth muscle or myofibroblast 
      origin. Proteoglycans admixed with lesser amounts of collagen constituted the 
      predominant matrix in the neointima. In 82% of vein samples, the media of vessel 
      walls contained large aggregates of collagen. A minority of veins expressed markers 
      of inflammation, cell proliferation, cell death, calcification, or neoangiogenesis. 
      In conclusion, we observed preexisting abnormalities, including neointimal 
      hyperplasia and prominent accumulation of extracellular matrix, in veins used for 
      AVF creation from a substantial proportion of this cohort.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for cardiovascular disease among chronic kidney disease 
      patients: results from the Chinese cohort study of chronic kidney disease 
      (C-STRIDE).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is observed 
      among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in developed countries, limited 
      information is available about CVD prevalence and risk factors in the Chinese CKD 
      population. The Chinese Cohort of Chronic Kidney Disease (C-STRIDE) was established 
      to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of CVD among Chinese CKD patients. 
      METHODS: Participants with stage 1-4 CKD (18-74 years of age) were recruited at 39 
      clinical centers located in 28 cities from 22 provinces of China. At entry, the 
      socio-demographic status, medical history, anthropometric measurements and lifestyle 
      behaviors were documented, and blood and urine samples were collected. Estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the CKD-EPI creatinine equation. 
      CVD diagnosis was based on patient self-report and review of medical records by 
      trained staff. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the 
      association between risk factors and CVD. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred 
      fifty-nine Chinese patients with pre-stage 5 CKD were enrolled, and 3168 finished 
      all required examinations and were included in the study. In total, 40.8% of the 
      cohort was female, with a mean age of 48.21 ± 13.70 years. The prevalence of CVD was 
      9.8%, and in 69.1% of the CVD cases cerebrovascular disease was observed. 
      Multivariable analysis showed that increasing age, lower eGFR, presence of 
      hypertension, abdominal aorta calcification and diabetes were associated with 
      comorbid CVD among CKD patients. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 
      these risk factors were 3.78 (2.55-5.59) for age 45-64 years and 6.07 (3.89-9.47) 
      for age ≥65 years compared with age <45 years; 2.07 (1.28-3.34) for CKD stage 3a, 
      1.66 (1.00-2.62) for stage 3b, and 2.74 (1.72-4.36) for stage 4 compared with stages 
      1 and 2; 2.57 (1.50-4.41) for hypertension, 1.82 (1.23-2.70) for abdominal aorta 
      calcification, and 1.70 (1.30-2.23) for diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      reported the CVD prevalence among a CKD patient cohort and found age, hypertension, 
      diabetes, abdominal aorta calcification and lower eGFR were independently associated 
      with higher CVD prevalence. Prospective follow-up and longitudinal evaluations of 
      CVD risk among CKD patients are warranted.

TI  - Scavenging Intracellular ROS Attenuates p-Cresyl Sulfate-Triggered Osteogenesis 
      through MAPK Signaling Pathway and NF-κB Activation in Human Arterial Smooth Muscle 
      Cells.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12080472 [doi]
LID - 472
AB  - Osteogenesis in human arterial smooth muscle cell (HASMC) is a key feature of uremic 
      vascular calcification (UVC). Concerning pro-oxidant properties of p-cresyl sulfate 
      (PCS), the therapeutic effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger on PCS 
      triggered inflammatory signaling transduction in osteogenesis was investigated in 
      this translational research. Based on severity level of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), arterial specimens with immunohistochemistry stain were quantitatively 
      analyzed for UVC, oxidative injury and osteogenesis along with PCS concentrations. 
      To mimic human UVC, HASMC model was used to explore whether PCS-induced ROS could 
      trigger mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways with nuclear factor-κB 
      (NF-κB) translocation that drive context-specific gene/protein expression, including 
      Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In 
      parallel with PCS accumulation, CKD arteries corresponded with UVC severity, 
      oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), Runx2 and ALP. PCS directly 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
      (JNK)/P38 (pERK/pJNK/pP38) and modulated NF-κB translocation to promote expressions 
      of Runx2 and ALP in HASMC. Notably, intracellular ROS scavenger attenuated pERK 
      signaling cascade and downstream osteogenic differentiation. Collectively, our data 
      demonstrate PCS induces osteogenesis through triggering intracellular ROS, 
      pERK/pJNK/pP38 MAPK pathways and NF-κB translocation to drive Runx2 and ALP 
      expressions, culminating in UVC. Beyond mineral dysregulation, osteocytic conversion 
      in HASMC could be the stimulation of PCS. Thus PCS may act as a pro-osteogenic and 
      pro-calcific toxin. From the perspective of translational medicine, PCS and 
      intracellular ROS could serve as potential therapeutic targets for UVC in CKD 
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of 
      studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant recipients, 
      and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft 
      prognosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal 
      transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We 
      established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before 
      transplantation. We analyzed the impact of calcification in graft and patient 
      survival, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal 
      function, and mineral metabolism. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) 
      before renal transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical 
      differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass 
      index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to 
      first 2 years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft 
      survival in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In 
      line with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and 
      cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P = 
      .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent predictor 
      for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time of 
      transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after renal 
      transplantation.

TI  - Growth Arrest-specific 6 Protein and Matrix Gla Protein in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 249-55
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Plasma protein growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) and matrix Gla protein 
      (MGP) are crucial mediators of vascular calcification and are involved in the 
      development of vascular complications in chronic kidney diseases. This study was set 
      out to investigate the relationship between plasma GAS6 levels and MGP in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Forty-six hemodialysis and 46 healthy individuals with normal kidneys were 
      recruited. Plasma GAS6 and MGP concentrations and related biochemical factors were 
      quantified as well as collection of data on clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Plasma GAS6 levels were significantly higher in the hemodialysis patients as 
      compared with the control group (763.52 ± 187.91 pg/mL versus 421.63 ± 189.91 pg/mL, 
      P < .001). Plasma MGP concentration was significantly lower in the hemodialysis 
      patients than the control group (52.35 ± 12.35 ng/mL versus 6.60 ± 19.54 ng/mL, P < 
      .001). The levels of GAS6 were inversely associated with MGP (r = -0.341, P = .02) 
      in the hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Increased GAS6 and decreased MGP levels 
      in hemodialysis patients, as mediators of induction or prevention of vascular 
      calcification, and their inverse correlation may suggest that there might be a role 
      in increased calcification process in hemodialysis patients or only as a secondary 
      phenomenon of advanced kidney failure. Their direct role on vascular calcification 
      needs further studies in the future.

TI  - Cigarette Smoking is Associated with Decreased Bone Gla-protein (BGP) Levels in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 603-609
LID - 10.2174/1570161115666170919182421 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-protein (BGP or osteocalcin) is a 
      vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of bone mineralization. 
      Smoking is a risk factor for osteoporosis. METHODS: We carried out a secondary 
      analysis of the Vitamin K Italian (VIKI) study to investigate the association 
      between cigarette smoking and BGP levels in patients with end stage renal disease. 
      Data were collected in 370 haemodialysis patients, 37% (136) smokers (or ex-smokers) 
      and 63% (234) nonsmokers. Vascular calcifications and vertebral fractures 
      (quantitative morphometry) were identified on spine radiographs. RESULTS: Smokers 
      had significantly lower BGP levels (152 vs. 204 µg/L, p=0.003). Smokers had lower 
      plasma phosphate levels (4.2 vs. 4.7 mg/dl, p<0.01). Lower BGP levels were 
      associated with aortic calcification (p<0.001), iliac calcification (p=0.042) and 
      vertebral fractures (p=0.023). In addition, the regression model showed that smoking 
      is associated with a significant reduction of total BGP levels by about 18% 
      (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical study in a haemodialysis 
      population, which identifies cigarette smoking as a potential factor that can lower 
      BGP levels, a protective agent in bone and vascular health.

AB  - AIM: To explore the relationship between circulating bone-specific alkaline 
      phosphatase (BALP) levels and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in patients 
      receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: A total of 156 MHD patients were 
      enrolled. Serum BALP levels were measured using ELISA, and AAC was assessed via 
      lateral abdominal radiography. RESULTS: BALP was positively correlated with AAC 
      score (r = 0.389; p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, dialysis vintage and BALP were independent risk 
      factors for AAC in MHD patients. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis 
      indicated that the area under the curve of BALP for the prediction of AAC was 0.737 
      (95% CI: 0.619-0.855; p < 0.01). When the detection cut-off level was 17.55 μg/l, 
      its sensitivity was 81.7% and specificity was 74.5%. CONCLUSION: Serum BALP is 
      closely correlated with vascular calcification in MHD patients.

TI  - Impact of vascular calcifications on arteriovenous fistula survival in hemodialysis 
      patients: a five-year follow-up.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1159/000380823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis 
      patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The aim 
      of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications may have 
      on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival. METHODS: This study included 90 
      patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular calcification scores 
      ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access calcification score); patients 
      were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and 
      severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 
      5 years after calcification measurement or until the patient's 
      death/transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with more pronounced vascular 
      calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed a significant relationship between calcification score and male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and 
      intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal 
      differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification 
      scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 
      3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 
      (CI 0.97-22.38). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse 
      survival of native arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.

TI  - Serum magnesium level and vascular stiffness in children with chronic kidney disease 
      on regular hemodialysis.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this 
      population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple 
      cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, 
      we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness 
      in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children 
      with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children 
      age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured, and Doppler 
      ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the peak systolic 
      velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) 
      arteries were recorded in the study patients. There were significantly lower serum 
      Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the controls (1.7 ± 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 
      ± 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the 
      aorta and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 ± 0.07 mm vs. 
      0.40 ± 0.09 mm; 0.98 ± 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 ± 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, 
      respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding the PSV of 
      the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study patients and the controls 
      (P >0.05). A negative correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT 
      (AIMT) (r = -0.682; P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was 
      found between the AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 
      0.025, 0.472, P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were 
      associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our 
      results warrants further study.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency, cardiovascular disease and abnormal bone mineral metabolism 
      are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Abnormal bone mineral metabolism has 
      been linked to vascular calcification in CKD. Sclerostin has emerged as an important 
      messenger in cross talk between bone-vascular axis. We analyzed sclerostin in 
      subjects who participated in the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial 
      investigating the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on vascular function in 
      non-diabetic CKD stage G3-4 and vitamin D ≤ 20 ng/ml [CTRI/2013/05/003648]. Patients 
      were randomized (1:1) to receive either two directly observed oral doses of 300,000 
      IU of cholecalciferol or matching placebo at baseline and 8 weeks. Of the 120 
      subjects enrolled, 58 in the cholecalciferol group and 59 in the placebo group 
      completed the study. At baseline, serum levels of sclerostin were similar in both 
      groups (cholecalciferol - median;190pg/ml, IQR;140-260 pg/ml and placebo - 
      median;180 pg/ml, IQR; 140-240 pg/ml, p = 0.67). 16 weeks after cholecalciferol 
      supplementation, there was no change in level of sclerostin (mean change;1.10 pg/ml, 
      95%CI; -27.34 to 29.34 pg/ml, p = 0.25). However, a significant decrease in 
      sclerostin level was noted in the placebo group (mean change; -31.94 pg/ml, 95%CI; 
      -54.76 to -9.13 pg/ml, p = 0.002). Change (Δ) in sclerostin level at 16 weeks 
      correlated negatively with Δ eGFR (r = -0.20, p = 0.03) and positively with Δuric 
      acid (r = 0.37, p < 0.001) but not with Δ25(OH) D (r = 0.06, p = 0.54), Δ iPTH 
      (r = - 0.03, p = 0.78) ΔFGF23 (r = - 0.08, p = 0.38) and Δ125 (OH)(2) D (r = - 0.04, 
      p = 0.65). In conclusion, high dose cholecalciferol supplementation did not change 
      sclerostin levels in non-diabetic stage 3-4 CKD subjects.

      Patients on Haemodialysis.
PG  - 169-74
LID - 10.1159/000431288 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that vascular calcification (VC) score was 
      associated with mortality in patients on haemodialysis (HD) and that a high serum 
      level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 were the 
      only factors associated with VC progression. AIM: To assess the impact of VC 
      progression on HD patient survival. METHODS: The study cohort including 85 HD 
      patients studied between 2006 and 2007 and between 2009 and 2010 was divided into 
      patients with VC progression (PG+, n = 38) and no-progression (PG-, n = 47), based 
      on VC scores measured twice at 3-year intervals (VC1 and VC2). Patients were 
      followed during 3 additional years. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis determined that 
      PG+ displayed increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 2.4; 95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 1.12-4.8; p = 0.03). This result was confirmed using a Cox proportional 
      hazards model adjusted for age, dialysis duration, the VC1 score, and the mean 
      FGF-23 and iPTH serum levels (HR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.12-6.6; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: VC 
      progression is associated with poor survival in patients on HD, irrespective of a 
      patient's baseline VC score.

TI  - Protocol adherence and the progression of cardiovascular calcification in the 
      ADVANCE study.
PG  - 146-52
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfs356 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE study assessed the progression of vascular and cardiac valve 
      calcification in 360 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) 
      assigned randomly to treatment either with cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D (≤ 6 
      µg/week of intravenous paricalcitol equivalent) or with varying doses of vitamin D 
      alone for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis, we compared CAC progression 
      among 70 protocol-adherent subjects given cinacalcet and low doses of vitamin D 
      (CPA) as specified in the study protocol and 120 control subjects given vitamin D 
      sterols. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics did not differ between CPA and 
      control subjects. The mean (standard error of the mean, SEM) doses of vitamin D at 
      week 2 were 4.7 (0.3) and 12.8 (1.0) µg/week in CPA and control subjects, 
      respectively, and the corresponding mean cumulative doses of vitamin D over 52 weeks 
      in each group were 225 (22) and 671 (47) µg. The median change in Agatston CAC score 
      after 52 weeks was less in CPA subjects than in controls (17.8% versus 31.3%, P = 
      0.02). The median increase in calcification scores in the aortic valve also was less 
      in CPA subjects than in controls (6.0% versus 51.5% P = 0.02). Reductions in serum 
      parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus levels were significantly greater in CPA 
      subjects than in controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The progression of cardiovascular 
      calcification was attenuated among cinacalcet-treated subjects with sHPT given low 
      doses of vitamin D per protocol compared with control subjects in whom sHPT was 
      treated with higher doses of vitamin D sterols alone.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the distribution of coronary artery calcium 
      score (CACS) by age group and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and to evaluate the 
      association between CV risk factors and CACS classification in asymptomatic adults. 
      The study included 31,545 asymptomatic Koreans, over 20 years of age with no 
      previous history of malignancy, proven coronary artery disease, or stroke, who 
      underwent CACS computed tomography at the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical 
      Center, between January 2005 and June 2013. Mean (±SD) age was 53.8 (±8.5) years 
      overall, 56.1 (±8.3) in men, and 53.3 (±8.5) in women. They were classified into 
      five groups based on their resting CACS: none (CAC = 0), minimal (0 < CAC ≤ 10), 
      mild (10 < CAC ≤ 100), moderate (100 < CAC ≤ 400), and extensive (400 > CAC). Older 
      age groups exhibited higher CACS values. The proportion of CACS classification in 
      our study was 55.5 % with no CACS, 9.5 % with minimal CACS, 19.8 % with mild CACS, 
      10.8 % with moderate CACS, and 4.3 % with extensive CACS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 
      were calculated for CV risk factors to determine their association with CACS. When 
      analyzed according to sex, in males, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with the 
      presence of hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, chronic kidney 
      disease, and smoking status. While, in females, the adjusted OR for CACS increased 
      with the presence of HT, DM, and obesity. CV risk factors appear to be significantly 
      associated with CACS in the Korean population.

TI  - Association of Soluble TNFR-1 Concentrations with Long-Term Decline in Kidney 
      Function: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 2713-2721
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2018070719 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1), which plays a causative role in endothelial 
      cell dysfunction and inflammation, is expressed on the cell surface in glomerular 
      and peritubular capillary endothelium of the kidneys. Higher soluble TNF receptor-1 
      (sTNFR-1) concentrations are associated with kidney disease progression among 
      persons with established diabetic kidney disease. However, no studies have assessed 
      sTNFR-1's role in long-term kidney function changes in a multiethnic population 
      without cardiovascular disease at baseline. METHODS: We tested associations between 
      baseline sTNFR-1 concentrations and 10-year decline in eGFR (incident ≥40% decline 
      and annual proportional decline) among 2548 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study 
      of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study. Serum creatinine 
      concentrations were determined at enrollment and study years 3, 5, and 10. RESULTS: 
      Mean age of participants was 61 years old, 53% were women, and mean baseline eGFR 
      was 79 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Serum sTNFR-1 was inversely associated with baseline 
      eGFR. Over median follow-up of 9.3 years, 110 participants developed ≥40% decline in 
      eGFR; each SD higher concentration of sTNFR1 was associated with higher risk of 40% 
      eGFR decline (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 
      1.77; P<0.001). The highest sTNFR-1 tertile was associated with adjusted annualized 
      decline in eGFR of 1.94% (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.09). Associations persisted across 
      subgroups defined by demographics, hypertension, diabetes, and baseline CKD status. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum sTNFR-1 concentrations are associated with faster 
      declines in eGFR over the course of a decade in a multiethnic population, 
      independent of previously known risk factors for kidney disease progression.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin as a predictor of renal and cardiovascular outcomes in renal 
      transplant recipients: follow-up data from the ALERT study.
PG  - 2571-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr694 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic kidney disease, vascular calcification 
      contributes to increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. CV risk 
      remains high after successful renal transplantation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a 
      glycoprotein, involved in the regulation of the vascular calcification process. 
      Previous studies have shown that elevated OPG is predictive of mortality in 
      high-risk populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value 
      of OPG for graft function, CV events and all-cause death, in a large transplant 
      cohort. METHODS: OPG was measured at baseline in renal transplant recipients 
      enrolled in the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) study, a 
      randomized placebo-controlled intervention study comparing fluvastatin and placebo. 
      Patients were followed for 6.7 years with evaluation of pre-specified end points, 
      graft loss, graft function, CV events and death. RESULTS: OPG was analysed in 1889 
      renal transplant recipients, with a mean value of 4.69 ± 1.85 pg/L. The number of 
      renal and CV events increased by quartiles of OPG. In the multivariate analysis, OPG 
      in the fourth as compared to first quartile was an independent predictor of graft 
      failure or doubling of serum creatinine [hazard ratio (HR) 2.20 (1.56-3.11), P < 
      0.001], major CV events [HR 2.40 (1.58-3.64), P < 0.001], cardiac mortality [HR 2.80 
      (1.32-5.94), P = 0.007] and all-cause mortality [HR 2.31 (1.53-3.49), P < 0.001]. 
      CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of kidney transplant patients with long-term 
      follow-up, OPG was independently associated with renal events, CV events and 
      mortality.

      transplantation.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.1159/000334597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis 
      patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT 
      interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to 
      elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval 
      duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We performed a 
      single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. 
      Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. 
      Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays. RESULTS: In the final 
      analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT 
      interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an 
      independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of 
      aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular 
      history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged 
      QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is 
      associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommendations concerning 
      screening for VC differ. Possible ability to prevent and reversibility of VC are 
      major subjects on debate whether screening for VC could improve outcomes of renal 
      patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the significance of simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) based on plane radiographic films and to test 
      its association with non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients on chronic HD. 
      METHODS: A study population consisted of 95 prevalent HD patients in the HD unit of 
      Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health sciences Kaunas Clinics. Clinical data 
      and laboratory tests information were collected from medical records. SVCS was 
      evaluated as it is described by Adragao et al. After measurement of VC, HD patients 
      were observed for novel non-fatal cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Patients were 
      divided into two groups: SVCS≥3 (57 patients [60%]) and <3 (38 patients [40%]). The 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a significant difference in non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events in the group with SVCS≥3 vs. <3 group (26.3% vs. 7.8%; log 
      rank 5,49; P=0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed a negative 
      impact of VC, hyperphosphatemia, and lower ejection fraction on cardiovascular 
      events. No statistically significant differences were observed comparing parameters 
      of Ca-P metabolism disorders between groups with different SVCS. On separate 
      analysis, the presence of VC in hands was also associated with higher rate of novel 
      cardiovascular events (score 0 goup-5 events [10.6%] vs. score≥1 group-13 events 
      [27%], log rank P=0.035). CONCLUSION: VC assessed by simple and inexpensive 
      radiological method was an independent predictor of novel non-fatal cardiovascular 
      events in HD patients.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score among several vascular calcification scores of 
      plain radiograph is the most reliable predictor of severe coronary artery 
      calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 729-735
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2017.1398666 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) score on computed tomography (CT) or 
      vascular calcification (VC) scores on plain radiographs are associated with 
      cardiovascular events and fracture. We investigated which VC score among several VC 
      scores on plain radiographs is predictor of CAC, and whether VC scores are related 
      with bone mineral density (BMD) in dialysis patients. METHODS: We checked several 
      plain radiographs (hands and pelvis [HP], feet and lateral lumbar spine), BMD and 
      multidetector CT scans of 55 patients maintaining dialysis in this cross-sectional 
      study. We analyzed data to find predictors for severe CAC which was defined as CAC 
      scores >400 on CT. RESULTS: Patients with severe CAC on CT had a higher proportion 
      of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score ≥5, HP score ≥3 and feet ≥1 than those 
      without severe CAC. The CAC score on CT was positively correlated with all VC scores 
      on plain radiographs. The AAC and CAC scores were negatively correlated with 
      T-scores for the BMD at the forearm and positively correlated with osteoprotegerin 
      levels. Among several VC scores on plain radiographs, the AAC ≥5 were independently 
      associated with severe CAC on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Several plain radiographs evaluating 
      VC scores, including a lateral lumbar spine view at the very least, can replace CT 
      checking CAC score in dialysis patients. The AAC score ≥5 may not only reveal severe 
      CAC but also give a hint of low bone mass at the forearm.

TI  - Are we overconcerned about secondary hyperparathyroidism and underestimating the 
      more common secondary hypoparathyroidism in our dialysis patients?
PG  - 102-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of hyper and 
      hypo-parathyroid state in prevalent dialysis patients. The second part of the study 
      was to look for the prevalence of vascular calcification (abdominal aortic) and 
      factors predicting calcification in these patients. METHODS: All adult patients, who 
      were more than 1 month on dialysis, were included in the study. A total of 68 
      patients, of which 75% were on hemodialysis and 25% on peritoneal dialysis, were 
      finally studied. Patients' parathyroid status was defined as per target 
      recommendation of KDOQI--hypoparathyroid with iPTH < or = 150 pg/ml and 
      hyperparathyroid with iPTH > 300 pg/ml. Vascular calcification was determined by X 
      ray of lateral lumbar spine to look for abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). The 
      AAC was scored as validated. The prevalence of hyper- and hypoparathyroidism in 
      dialysis patients was determined as percentage of total dialysis patients. The 
      prevalence of AAC and factors predicting it was analyzed by 'univariate' and 
      'multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 50.04 
      +/- 14.15 years, 58.82% were males and 42.64% were diabetics. Mean duration of 
      dialysis was 22.36 +/- 19.17 months. Hyperparathyroidism was seen in only 27.94% of 
      all dialysis patients, while hypoparathyroidism was in 45.58%. Abdominal aortic 
      calcification was seen in 79.41% of overall patients and 13.23% had significant 
      calcification (score 7-24). On univariate analysis, age (0.000) and iPTH (0.03) were 
      the only variables predicting AAC and on logistic regression analysis, age was the 
      only independent predictor of abdominal aortic calcification (p = 0.002, OR 1.11, CI 
      1.038-1.186). CONCLUSION: Hypoparathyroidism is more common (46%) in our dialysis 
      patients as compared to hyperparathyroidism (28%). There is high prevalence of 
      vascular (abdominal aortic) calcification (80%) in our dialysis patients.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Predicts Less Coronary Artery Calcification and Diabetic Kidney 
      Disease Over 12 Years in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The CACTI Study.
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.2337/dc18-1527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between serum 
      uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal 
      protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during 
      2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes of 
      24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and after 
      a mean follow-up period of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion was defined 
      as ACR ≥30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year), and impaired GFR as 
      eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SUMOD was measured on stored baseline plasma samples 
      (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam computed tomography. 
      CAC progression was defined as a change in the square root-transformed CAC volume of 
      ≥2.5. RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level conferred lower odds of CAC progression 
      (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97), incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 
      0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56; 0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 0.24-0.83) 
      per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 ng/mL) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, 
      systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD 
      to models with traditional risk factors also significantly improved the prediction 
      performance for CAC progression and incident DKD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD 
      level predicted lower odds of both CAC progression and incident DKD over 12 years in 
      adults with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Radiographic assessment of vascular calcification, aortic pulse wave velocity, 
      ankle-brachial index and fibroblast growth factor-23 in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 378-83
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12082 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease and end 
      stage renal disease. In both the general population and patients with end stage 
      renal disease, vascular calcification is related to arterial stiffness and is a 
      predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various diagnostic methods are 
      currently used to assess vascular calcification. There is a preference for simple, 
      reliable methods that can be used in daily practice. Therefore, several imaging and 
      laboratory methods are investigated. Twenty-eight patients with mean age of 62 years 
      on chronic hemodialysis were enrolled in the study. The mean duration of 
      hemodialysis treatment was 70 months (range 3 to 350 months). Vascular calcification 
      was assessed with coronary computed tomography and lateral lumbar, pelvic and hand 
      radiographs. Vascular stiffness was evaluated using aortic pulse wave velocity and 
      ankle-brachial index measurements, and finally serum levels of fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 were followed. A statistically significant correlation was demonstrated 
      between all the following parameters: coronary artery calcification score, aortic 
      pulse wave velocity, abdominal aortic calcification score, simple vascular 
      calcification scores in pelvis and hand. A statistically significant correlation of 
      ankle-brachial index >1.3 to coronary artery calcification score was found. There 
      was no correlation between the previous parameters and fibroblast growth factor-23. 
      The results of our study indicate that simple imaging methods could provide 
      confident vascular damage assessment and therefore potentially guide therapy 
      adjustments. An association between fibroblast growth factor-23 and the other 
      diagnostic modalities in our study was not found.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification in patients with CKD.
PG  - 109-118
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0260-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is independently associated with 
      cardiovascular events in dialysis patients and in the general population. However, 
      data in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are limited. We analyzed 
      determinants and prognostic value of AAC in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: We 
      included patients with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy from the 
      MASTERPLAN study, a randomized controlled trial that started in 2004. In the period 
      2008-2009, an X-ray to evaluate AAC was performed in a subgroup of patients. We 
      studied AAC using a semi-quantitative scoring system by lateral lumbar X-ray. We 
      used baseline and 2-year data to find determinants of AAC. We used a composite 
      cardiovascular endpoint and propensity score matching to evaluate the prognostic 
      value of AAC. RESULTS: In 280 patients an X-ray was performed. In 79 patients (28 %) 
      the X-ray showed no calcification, in 62 patients (22 %) calcification was minor 
      (<4), while 139 patients (50 %) had moderate or heavy calcification (≥4). Older age, 
      prior cardiovascular disease, higher triglyceride levels, and higher phosphate 
      levels were independent determinants of a calcification score ≥4. AAC score ≥4 was 
      independently associated with cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio of 5.5 
      (95 % confidence interval 1.2-24.8). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of AAC can identify CKD 
      patients at higher cardiovascular risk, and may provide important information for 
      personalized treatment. Whether this approach will ultimately translate into better 
      outcomes remains to be answered.

TI  - Nonculprit coronary plaque characteristics of chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 448-56
LID - 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.112.000165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) promotes the development of atherosclerosis 
      and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was 
      to compare the coronary plaque characteristics of patients with and without CKD 
      using optical coherence tomography. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 463 
      nonculprit plaques from 287 patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) 
      optical coherence tomography registry. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). A total of 402 plaques (250 patients) were 
      in the non-CKD group and 61 plaques (37 patients) were in the CKD group. Compared 
      with non-CKD plaques, plaques with CKD had a larger lipid index (mean lipid 
      arc×lipid length, 1248.4±782.8 mm° [non-CKD] versus 1716.1±1116.2 mm° [CKD]; 
      P=0.003). Fibrous cap thickness was not significantly different between the groups. 
      Calcification (34.8% [non-CKD] versus 50.8% [CKD]; P=0.041), cholesterol crystals 
      (11.2% [non-CKD] versus 23.0% [CKD]; P=0.048), and plaque disruption (5.5% [non-CKD] 
      versus 13.1% [CKD]; P=0.049) were more frequently observed in the CKD group. In the 
      multivariate linear regression model, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for a larger lipid index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-CKD patients, the patients with CKD had a larger 
      lipid index with a higher prevalence of calcium, cholesterol crystals, and plaque 
      disruption. The multivariate linear regression model demonstrated that a lower 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate was an independent risk factor for a larger 
      lipid index.

TI  - Vascular calcification and subendocardial ischemia in hemodialysis patients: a new 
      morpho-functional score to assess cardiovascular risk: the Solofra score.
PG  - 121-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: ESRD (end-stage renal disease) patients have a high cardiovascular 
      mortality risk. A morphofunctional approach of vascular calcifications and 
      myocardial perfusion is needed for the management of ESRD patients. We used SEVR 
      (sub-endocardial viability ratio) and Kauppila score from the dialysis population of 
      the Independent study to create a new morpho-functional score to assess 
      cardiovascular risk in this population (the Solofra score). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      184 patients were followed-up for 36 months. A side lumbar X-ray was performed to 
      assess vascular calcifications of lumbar aorta using the Kauppila score. Central 
      aortic pressure and pulse velocity wave (PWV) were assessed at the carotid artery 
      site. Myocardial perfusion was estimated with SEVR. Independent risk mortality 
      factors were identified with univariate regression analysis (p<0.01); significance 
      was defined as p<0.05. RESULTS: Kauppila score was 13±10(range 0-24); PWV was 9.5±4 
      m/sec; basal SEVR was 1.3±0.9. We observed an improvement of ROC curves for SEVR and 
      Kauppila score together compared to the ones for SEVR or Kauppila score alone. 
      CONCLUSION: A quantitative analysis of vascular calcifications should be associated 
      to a qualitative evaluation of arterial damage to better estimate cardiovascular 
      mortality risk of ESRD patients. Further studies are needed to verify our 
      hypothesis.

TI  - Osteoprotegerin Is the Strongest Predictor for Progression of Arterial Calcification 
      in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.
PG  - 39-46
LID - 10.1159/000477380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification (AC) is frequent in patients with end stage renal 
      disease and is also considered a risk factor for later morbidity and mortality. 
      However, long-term factors associated with the process are not well known. We 
      analyzed the trends over time of biomarkers related with development and progression 
      of AC in incident patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We performed a 
      prospective study with 186 patients on PD followed up for 1 year. We analyzed the 
      progression of AC in the abdominal aorta and pelvic vessels by calcification score 
      (CaSc), using16-cut computerized multidetector tomography at baseline and 1 year. 
      Variables related with PD treatment, inflammation, and mineral metabolism were 
      measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Changes in biochemical 
      variables were analyzed for their relationship with changes in AC. RESULTS: Over 1 
      year, the number of patients with AC increased from 47 to 56%, and CaSc from 355 
      (interquartile range [IQR] 75-792) to 529 (IQR 185-1632). A total of 43.5% of 
      patients remained free of calcification, 11.7% had new calcifications, and 44.8% had 
      progression of calcification. Older age, diabetes, high systolic blood pressure, 
      body mass index, cholesterol, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), as well as lower levels of 
      albumin, serum creatinine, and osteocalcin, were associated with development of new, 
      and rapid progression of, calcification. In multivariate logistic analysis, OPG 
      remained the most significant (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.47, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      OPG was the strongest risk factor associated with new development and rapid 
      progression of AC in incident PD patients.

AB  - We used high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine possible changes in 
      the morphology of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and to investigate 
      their influence on vascular calcification in uremic patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis (MHD). 36 uremic patients had cardiovascular diseases after MHD (MHD 
      group1) and 30 uremic patients did not (MHD group 2), and 20 healthy volunteers were 
      the control group. The extent of coronary artery calcification was assessed with 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS). AFM was used to analyze PBMCs nuances. 
      Concentrations of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in PBMC supernatants were 
      detected by ELISA. Protein expressions of BMP-2 were measured by Western blot. No 
      significant differences in PBMC morphology were observed among groups by light 
      microscopy. AFM images revealed that uremic patients exhibited significant 
      differences of PBMC morphology and vascular calcification when compared with healthy 
      volunteers. The PBMCs in uremic patients were larger in volume, mean height, 
      half-maximum amplitude, average roughness and higher concentrations and expression 
      of BMP-2 and CACS (P < 0.05), with granular processes or caveolae of uneven size 
      distributed over cell surfaces. These differences were also significant between MHD 
      group 1 and group 2 (P < 0.05). PBMC volume, mean height, half-maximum amplitude, 
      and average roughness were positively correlated with BMP-2 and CACS. Moreover, the 
      correlation PBMC with BMP-2 was higher than with CACS. PBMC morphology in MHD 
      patients was related to the degree of vascular calcification. The larger mean 
      height, half-maximum amplitude, average roughness and cell volume were, the higher 
      degree of vascular calcification was.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in 
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly 
      recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels 
      of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study 
      investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with 
      all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc 
      survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 
      2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters 
      of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum 
      sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: 
      Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] 
      pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older 
      age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a 
      median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels 
      were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum 
      sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When 
      bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the 
      causal pathway.

      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular 
      calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (Mönckeberg disease). 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs 
      and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) 
      creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications 
      outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for 
      ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white 
      echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then 
      applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits 
      (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained 
      ≥ 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum 
      calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was 
      compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a 
      high VcS ≥ 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier 
      statistics were used for comparisons among the groups. RESULTS: Nineteen patients 
      had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS ≥ 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a 
      mean age of 68 ± 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to 
      a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central 
      venous catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 
      ± 41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 ± 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months), and 
      66.7 ± 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009). Forty-seven 
      patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in the controls; P 
      = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%, 65.7%, 54.8%, and 
      48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II; and 97.7%, 93.1%, 
      76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 for all groups; P = 
      .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or without CVCs at 
      baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc had lower survival 
      rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%) and at 3 years (47.7% vs 
      75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of death only in subgroup II 
      patients compared with the subcontrol group patients (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, 
      respectively; P = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic hemodialysis patients exposed to high 
      levels of upper extremity arterial medial VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased 
      long-term mortality risk compared with diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and 
      receiving the same access. Patients with CVCs/Vc had the lowest survival rates.

TI  - Effect of essential amino acid кetoanalogues and protein restriction diet on 
      morphogenetic proteins (FGF-23 and Кlotho) in 3b-4 stages chronic кidney disease 
      patients: a randomized pilot study.
PG  - 1351-1359
LID - 10.1007/s10157-018-1591-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low protein diet (LPD) with essential amino acid ketoanalogue 
      supplementation (KA) may contribute in improving of chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      while the exact mechanisms of KA's effect are not established yet. We have conducted 
      a prospective, randomized, controlled comparative study of LPD + KA and LPD alone in 
      relation to serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels in CKD patients. METHODS: 79 non-diabetic 
      CKD 3b-4 stage patients, compliant with LPD diet (0.6 g/kg of body weight/day), had 
      been selected. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group (42 
      patients) received LPD + КA. The second group (37 patients) continued the LРD alone. 
      In addition to routine tests, serum Klotho, FGF-23 levels, as well as bioimpedance 
      analysis, sphygmography (stiffness (augmentation) indices (AI), central (aortal) 
      blood pressure) with a «SphygmaCor» device; echocardiography (valvular calcification 
      score (VCS) and LVMMI), were performed. RESULTS: There were body mass indices' 
      decrease (p = 0.046), including muscle body mass in men (p = 0.027) and woman 
      (p = 0.044) in the LPD group to the end of study (14th month). In addition, lower 
      FGF-23 (p = 0.029), and higher sKlotho (p = 0.037) were detected in the LPD + KA 
      group compared to the LPD one. The increase in AI (p = 0.034), VCS (p = 0.048), and 
      LVMMI (p = 0.023) was detected more often in the LPD group at the end of study. 
      CONCLUSION: LPD + KA provides support for nutrition status and contributes to more 
      efficient correction of FGF-23 and Klotho abnormalities that may result in 
      cardiovascular calcification and cardiac remodeling decreasing in CKD. At the same 
      time, a prolonged LPD alone may lead to malnutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher mortality 
      in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to correlate 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS: A survival 
      analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed by multidetector-row 
      computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0∼105 U), group 2 (110∼1067 
      U), and group 3 (1094∼15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months. 
      Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD 
      duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly 
      lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and 52.2%, 
      respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%, respectively). Cox 
      proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration revealed that 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than 
      those of groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: CACS is helpful to predict prognosis of HD 
      patients independently of age and HD duration.

AB  - Presence and severity of cardiovascular calcifications strongly predict 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. This multicenter, 
      cross-sectional study primarily aimed to determine prevalence of abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC) detected by plain lateral abdominal radiograph, and secondarily 
      aimed to assess predictive factors for AAC. Patients (N = 1500), aged 18-70 years, 
      with CKD stages 3-5D for ≥3 months prior to evaluation, were enrolled at 24 study 
      centers in Thailand; 54.3% were non-dialysis patients. The prevalence of AAC was 
      70.6% and 70.8% in non-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively. Patient's 
      advanced age and widening pulse pressure were identified as predictive factors for 
      AAC ≥ 5 in non-dialysis patients, while patient's age, history of coronary heart 
      disease or diabetes, longer dialysis vintage, and increasing corrected serum calcium 
      or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were identified as such in dialysis patients. 
      With additional regression having covariates in binary, corrected serum calcium ≥9.5 
      mg/dL gave an OR 1.974 (95% CI: 1.324-2.943) for AAC ≥ 5 among the dialysis 
      patients. AAC in diabetes subgroup (N = 692) was additionally evaluated and found 
      that it was prevalent at 84.7% with increased phosphorus as predictive factor (OR, 
      1.178; 95% CI: 1.032-1.344) and 1,25 (OH)(2) vitamin D as protective factor (OR, 
      0.983; 95% CI, 0.970-0.996). The prevalence of AAC in the Thai CKD population is 
      lower than that reported in the literature, and yet the burden is prominent in 
      patients coexisting with diabetes. Variable relationships identified in this study 
      may guide preventive measures against cardiovascular complications in CKD patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) associated to chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      is a complex phenomenon closely related to mineral bone metabolism disorders. Many 
      are the factors implicated, as the drugs used in the treatment of CKD. Some in vitro 
      studies suggest that electrolyte and acid-base disorders induced by hemodialysis 
      (HD) may play a key role in VC. METHODS: We analyzed electrolyte and acid-base 
      disorders that occur during an HD session in 26 patients randomly assigned to 1,25 
      mM or 1,5 mM calcium bath. RESULTS: There is a calcium load in all the patients, 
      independently of calcium bath concentration or basal serum calcium levels. At the 
      end of the session, 100% of the patients dialyzed with 1,5 mM calcium bath have 
      calcium serum levels > 1,3 mM. However, this only occurs in 15% of the patients 
      dialysed with 1,25 mM calcium bath. During this calcium load, phosphorus levels 
      persist uncontrolled. Besides, there is a progressive alkalinization in all the 
      patients. In the end of the session 50% have serum bicarbonate > 30 mM and 23% pH > 
      7,5. CONCLUSIONS: During HD sessions occur electrolyte and acid-base disorders that 
      induce VC: Calcium load and alkalization in presence of elevated phosphorus levels. 
      It is necessary to perform studies with kinetic models of calcium load and 
      alkalinization different from the actual ones.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification score can predict future coronary artery disease in 
      hemodialysis patients: a 5-year prospective cohort study.
PG  - 313

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has been known to be associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis. However, the association between AAC 
      and future coronary artery disease (CAD) occurrence is not clear. We aimed to 
      clarify the association of AAC severity and the occurrence of future CAD events in 
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Hemodialysis (HD) patients were recruited in this 
      prospective cohort study. AAC severity was quantified by AAC score, which was 
      measured by lateral lumbar radiography. We used receiver operation curve (ROC) 
      analysis to find the cutoff AAC value for CAD prediction. CAD-free survival was 
      analyzed by Kaplan-Meier study. RESULTS: There were 303 patients recruited for study 
      with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 95 (65-146) months. The AAC score 
      in patients with occurrence of new CAD [9 (3-15.25), n = 114] was higher than in 
      patients without new CAD occurrence [5 (1-9) n = 189], p < 0.001. Multivariate 
      hazard ratio of AAC score for CAD was 1.039 (p = 0.016). ROC study showed that an 
      AAC score of 5.5 had a sensitivity of 0.658 and a specificity of 0.587 in the 
      prediction of new CAD occurrence. Patients with AAC score above 5.5 had 
      significantly higher cumulative incidence of CAD than patients with AAC score below 
      5.5. Age, diabetes, prior history of CAD, and longer dialysis vintage were major 
      factors associated with higher AAC score. CONCLUSIONS: AAC score can predict the 
      occurrence of future CAD events in HD patients. The best cut-off value of AAC score 
      is 5.5. AAC score greater than 5.5 is a reliable abdominal aortic calcification 
      marker, and can predict future CAD in ESRD patients. Major contributive factors for 
      higher AAC score were age, presence of diabetes, prior history of CAD, and longer 
      dialysis vintage.

TI  - Cholecalciferol in haemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, 
      proof-of-concept and safety study.
PG  - 1779-86
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of cholecalciferol supplementation in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) patients has been questioned. The objective of this randomized double-blinded 
      study is to assess whether cholecalciferol therapy can increase serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in haemodialysed patients and the safety 
      implications of this therapy on certain biological parameters and vascular 
      calcifications score. METHODS: Forty-three haemodialysis patients were randomized to 
      receive placebo or cholecalciferol (25,000 IU) therapy every 2 weeks. The biological 
      parameters, serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D and parathormone (PTH) levels, were 
      monitored monthly for 12 consecutive months. Vascular calcifications were assessed 
      by lateral X-ray radiography. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean serum 25(OH)D levels 
      were low and similar in both groups. Thirty patients (16 treated and 14 placebo) 
      completed the study: 11 patients died (5 placebo and 6 treated), 1 patient dropped 
      out and 1 patient was transplanted (both from the placebo group). After 1 year, the 
      percentage of 25(OH)D deficient patients was significantly lower in the treated 
      group. None of the patients developed hypercalcaemia. The PTH levels tended to 
      increase over the study period under placebo and to decrease in the cholecalciferol 
      group. The median changes in PTH levels from baseline to 1 year were statistically 
      different between the two groups [+80 (-58 to 153) and -115 (-192 to 81) under 
      placebo and cholecalciferol treatment, respectively, P=0.02].The calcification 
      scores increased equivalently in both groups (+2.3 per year). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cholecalciferol is effective and safe, and does not negatively affect calcium, 
      phosphorus, PTH levels and vascular calcifications. Additional studies are needed to 
      compare the impacts of nutritional and active vitamin D agents on vascular 
      calcification and mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      physiological levels of myo-inositol hexaphosphate (phytate) and cardiovascular (CV) 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted from December 2012 to 
      June 2013. SUBJECTS: Sixty-nine consecutive patients with CKD who were not 
      undergoing renal replacement therapy. INTERVENTION: All subjects were given lateral 
      lumbar X-rays to quantify abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). Clinical laboratory 
      analyses and phytate food frequency questionnaires were also performed. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Phytate urinary excretion, estimated phytate consumption (based on food 
      frequency questionnaire) and AAC score. Patients were divided into two groups based 
      on median abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) score: no/mild AAC (AAC ≤ 6, n = 35) 
      and moderate/severe AAC (AAC > 6, n = 34). RESULTS: Patients with no/mild AAC were 
      younger, had lower pulse pressure, greater dietary intake of phytate, greater 
      urinary phytate and the prevalence of prior CV disease was significantly lower 
      compared to patients with moderate/severe AAC. Among the top 10 phytate-rich foods, 
      lentil consumption was significantly greater in patients with no/mild AAC than in 
      those with moderate/severe AAC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated 
      that age, prior CV disease, urinary phytate (or lentil consumption) were 
      independently associated to AAC. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adequate 
      consumption of phytate can prevent AAC in patients with CKD. Further prospective 
      studies must be performed to elucidate the benefits of a phytate-rich diet and the 
      associated risk of phosphorus bioavailability in these patients.

TI  - Elevated Circulating Osteoprotegerin Levels in the Plasma of Hemodialyzed Patients 
      With Severe Artery Calcification.
PG  - 519-529
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12681 [doi]
AB  - We studied the correlations between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level and 
      radial artery calcification (RAC) assessed histologically and carotid artery 
      intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). Moreover, we studied the relationship between OPG 
      levels and all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality during a 5-year observation 
      period. The study comprised 59 CKD patients (36 hemodialyzed (HD), 23 predialysis). 
      The biochemical parameters included: creatinine, calcium, phosphate, intact 
      parathormone, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor II 
      (TNFRII), transforming growth factor-β, hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23, osteonectin (ON), osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin. CCA-IMT 
      and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by ultrasound. Fragments of 
      radial artery obtained during creation of HD access were prepared for microscopy and 
      stained for calcifications with alizarin red. RAC was detected in 34 patients (58%). 
      In multiple regression adjusted for dialysis status, TNFRII, ON and Framingham risk 
      score (FRS) were identified as the independent predictors of OPG. Serum OPG above 
      the median value of 7.55 pmol/L significantly predicted the presence of RAC in 
      simple logistic regression (OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.39-20.4; P = 0.012) and in multiple 
      logistic regression adjusted for FRS, dialysis status and CCA-IMT values (OR 6.56; 
      95%CI 1.06-40.6; P = 0.036). OPG levels above the median were associated with higher 
      CCA-IMT values (1.02 ± 0.10 vs. 0.86 ± 0.13; P < 0.001) and predicted the presence 
      of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery (OR 14.4; 95%CI 2.84-72.9; P < 0.001), 
      independently of FRS, dialysis status and RAC. In this study, elevated serum OPG 
      levels correlated with higher CCA-IMT, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and 
      the severity of the RAC independently of each other. During follow-up, 25 patients 
      (42%) died, including 21 due to CV causes. In multiple Cox regression, OPG above the 
      median predicted overall survival independently of dialysis status, Framingham risk 
      score, CCA-IMT above the median value, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques 
      in CCA, but not independently of RAC. We postulate that circulating OPG may play a 
      dual role as a marker for both medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis, 
      hence it seems to be a valuable tool for assessing CV risk in patients with CKD. OPG 
      might be an early indicator of all-cause mortality in CKD patients with advanced 
      medial arterial calcification.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an independent predictor of 
      increased mortality in patients on dialysis and those undergoing renal 
      transplantation. We investigated PH and its association with vascular calcification 
      and endothelial dysfunction in renal transplant patients. METHODS: The records of 
      300 consecutive patients who underwent renal transplant in our center between 2005 
      to 2012 were evaluated. PH was defined as systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) 
      ≥ 35 mm Hg. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, pulse wave velocity 
      (PWv), and renal recessive indices (RRI) were collected and compared among patients 
      with and without PH. RESULTS: Eight patients in PH group (age 36 [19] years) and 87 
      subjects in nPH group (age 35 [9] years) were evaluated. Demographic and clinical 
      characteristics and laboratory data of the 2 groups were similar. Additionally, sPAP 
      was positively correlated with PWv (r = 0.263, P = .01). In multivariate analyses, 
      RRI (P = .004), serum CRP (P = .025), and PWv (P = .001) were associated with 
      pulmonary artery pressure. CONCLUSION: PH is significantly associated with arterial 
      stiffness in renal transplant recipients who have a high risk for cardiovascular 
      disease. Considering the common prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, including PH, 
      we suggested that all patients with renal transplantation should be evaluated for 
      regular echocardiographic examination in clinical practice.

TI  - Surgical Techniques and Procedures for Kidney Transplant Recipients With Severe 
      Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 594-601
LID - 10.6002/ect.2016.0207 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis is becoming a more common problem for dialysis patients. 
      Therefore, transplant surgeons are faced with the need to develop surgical 
      techniques and procedures for severe atherosclerosis. This study aimed to clarify 
      the clinical features, the usefulness of examinations, and operative procedures for 
      kidney transplant recipients with the complication of severe atherosclerosis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 220 kidney transplant candidates, 13 patients (severe 
      atherosclerosis group) were predicted complications due to arterial calcification in 
      the bilateral iliac arterial system using a computed tomographic scan. They were 
      compared with the remaining 207 patients (mild atherosclerosis group) based on 
      patient characteristics. The severe atherosclerosis group was evaluated by 
      additional examination, anastomosis procedure of the graft artery, and patient 
      outcome. RESULTS: The severe atherosclerosis group had significantly higher rates of 
      mean recipient age, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, past smoking, and administration of 
      antithrombotics. Past vascular surgery related to atherosclerosis in the aortoiliac 
      region had been performed in 8 patients from the severe atherosclerosis group. A 
      three-dimensional computed tomography angiography and an intraoperative periarterial 
      echography were useful to determine the kidney transplant site. A balloon catheter 
      effectively blocked blood flow. A polytetrafluoroethylene vascular graft was used 
      for bypass between the graft artery and abdominal aorta. All kidney grafts of the 
      severe atherosclerosis group were functioning well. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant 
      for patients with severe atherosclerosis can be achieved successfully by additional 
      examinations and vascular surgical techniques.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. We evaluated 126 asymptomatic CKD patients (mean estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate: 36.1 ± 14.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), mean age 
      70.3 ± 10.1 years). A non-contrast computed tomography scan was used to determine 
      the abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) and CAC score, and this relationship 
      was investigated. Among the subjects, AAC was present in 109 patients (86.5 %) as 
      defined by ACI >0 and median ACI was 11.7 %. ACI increased in accordance with 
      advances in CAC score grades (3.0, 5.2, 17.2, and 32.8 % for CAC score 0, 1-100, 
      101-400, and 401 or more, respectively, p < 0.001). Even after multivariate 
      adjustment, ACI was independently associated with severe CAC score as defined by CAC 
      score >400 [odds ratio 1.08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.12, p < 0.001]. 
      Receiver-operating curve analysis showed that the ACI optimal cut-off value 
      predicting severe CAC score was 16.5 % (area under the curve = 0.79, 95 % CI 
      0.69-0.90, p < 0.001). The C statics for predicting CAC score was significantly 
      increased by adding ACI values to the model including other risk factors (0.853 
      versus 0.737, p = 0.023). In conclusion, the ACI value of 16.5 % allows us to 
      predict the presence of severe CAC in CKD patients, and that the addition of ACI to 
      the model with traditional risk factors significantly improves the predictive 
      ability of severe CAC score. These data reinforce the utility of ACI as a screening 
      tool in clinical practice.

TI  - Daily intake and serum concentration of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) in haemodialysis 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Decreased concentration of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) seems to be an important 
      risk factor of vascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimal 
      dietary intake, as well as serum MK-4 reference range, in HD has not been 
      determined, yet. The aim of the present study was to assess daily vitamin K1 and 
      MK-4 intakes and their relation to serum MK-4 concentration in HD patients. DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: Daily vitamin K1 and MK-4, micro- and macronutrients and energy intakes 
      were assessed using 3-day food diary completed by patients and serum MK-4 
      concentration was measured by HPLC [limit of quantification (LOQ): 0.055 ng/mL] in 
      85 HD patients (51 males) and 22 apparently healthy subjects. RESULTS: Daily MK-4 
      intake was significantly lower (by 29%) among HD, while K1 consumption was similar 
      in both groups. Daily MK-4 intake was associated with fat and protein consumption in 
      HD (r=0.43, p<0.001 and r=0.33, p=0.004, respectively). In HD serum MK-4 
      concentration was more frequently below LOQ (in 41% HD and 5% controls, p<0.001) and 
      in those HD with quantifiable values was lower than in the controls (by 42%). The 
      correlations between MK-4 concentrations and both MK-4 and K1 daily intakes were 
      weaker in HD (r=0.38 and r=0.30 respectively) than in the control group (r=0.47 and 
      r=0.45, respectively). In multiple regression analysis the variability of serum MK-4 
      concentrations in HD patients was explained by its daily intake. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Decreased serum MK-4 concentration in HD patients is caused by lower dietary MK-4 
      intake, mainly due to diminished meat consumption, and in addition, probably reduced 
      K1 conversion.

TI  - Application of a Novel CT-Based Iliac Artery Calcification Scoring System for 
      Predicting Renal Transplant Outcomes.
PG  - 436-41
LID - 10.2214/AJR.15.14794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and 
      distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium 
      scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT of 
      the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56 women 
      with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate semiquantitative 
      score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and morphology for the 
      common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The operative and 
      clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial segment was used for 
      anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether delayed graft function 
      (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using 
      the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for 
      each calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly 
      higher average calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all 
      categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of 
      higher scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, 
      hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the 
      calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was 
      independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of 
      the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT 
      evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival after 
      transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis 
      was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine 
      pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with 
      diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to 
      optimize outcomes.

AB  - Since beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is a surrogate marker for middle molecular weight 
      uremic toxins and the major protein component in dialysis-related amyloidosis, it 
      has been frequently studied in dialysis patients. It is not known, however, whether 
      B2M has an impact in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on dialysis. 
      Here we studied the relationship of plasma B2M levels to clinical and cardiovascular 
      outcomes in 142 patients (mean age of 67 years) at different stages of CKD. B2M 
      levels increased with CKD stage and thus were highest in hemodialysis patients. 
      Baseline B2M levels were associated with vascular calcification but not with 
      arterial stiffness or bone density. During a mean follow-up of 969 days, 44 patients 
      died and 49 suffered a cardiovascular event. Higher B2M levels were independently 
      associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in 
      the whole cohort and with cardiovascular events in the predialysis cohort. Moreover, 
      B2M appeared to be a better predictor than well-established factors associated with 
      outcomes in this population, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate ((eGFR), 
      only for predialysis patients), inflammation biomarkers, and other factors included 
      in a propensity score. Thus, we confirm the strong relationship between B2M levels 
      and eGFR and confirm the power of B2M to predict overall and cardiovascular 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients at different stages of CKD.

AB  - Chronic inflammation was found to be correlated with coronary (CAC) and thoracic 
      peri-aortic calcification (TAC) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. 
      Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was introduced as a potential marker to 
      determine inflammation in cardiac and noncardiac disorders. Data regarding NLR and 
      its association with TAC and CAC are lacking. We aimed to determine the relationship 
      between NLR and vascular calcification in ESRD patients. This was a cross-sectional 
      study involving 56 ESRD patients (22 females, 34 males; mean age, 49.9 ± 14.2 years) 
      receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for ≥6 months in the Dialysis Unit of 
      Necmettin Erbakan University. TAC and CAC scores were measured by using an 
      electrocardiogram-gated 64-multidetector computed tomography. NLR was calculated as 
      the ratio of the neutrophils and lymphocytes. There was a statistically significant 
      correlation between NLR, TACS and CACS in ESRD patients (r = 0.43, P = 0.001 and 
      r = 0.30, P = 0.02, respectively). The stepwise linear regression analysis revealed 
      that age, as well as NLR were independent predictors of TACS. However, increased age 
      was the only independent predictor of CACS according to linear regression analysis. 
      Simple calculation of NLR can predict vascular calcification in ESRD patients.

AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis 
      vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This study 
      examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in brachial 
      and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven 
      radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine predialysis 
      and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender matched controls 
      undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation (6 renal). Arterial 
      stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology, morphometric analysis of 
      intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load was performed using standard 
      techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients demonstrated significant arterial 
      intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio higher than controls (0.13 ± 0.12 vs. 
      0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium deposition was demonstrated on histology and the 
      calcium content in patients was higher than controls (34.68 ± 26.86 vs. 
      10.95 ± 9.18 μg/μg, p = 0.003). The blood vessel calcium content correlated with 
      arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p = 0.018). This study for the first time describes, 
      and suggests mechanistic linkage between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium 
      deposition, and increased functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis 
      patients. Our research could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the 
      uremic vasculature impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.

PG  - 413-22
LID - 10.2215/CJN.07900715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Soluble TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) is a 
      proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily. sTWEAK concentrations 
      have been associated with the presence of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We 
      hypothesized that sTWEAK levels may relate to a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic 
      plaques, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular outcomes observed in patients 
      with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A 4-year prospective, 
      multicenter, longitudinal study was conducted in 1058 patients with CKD stages 3-5D 
      (mean age =58±13 years old; 665 men) but without any history of CVD from the NEFRONA 
      Study (a study design on the prevalence of surrogate markers of CVD). Ankle-brachial 
      index and B-mode ultrasound were performed to detect the presence of carotid and/or 
      femoral atherosclerotic plaques together with biochemical measurements and sTWEAK 
      assessment. Patients were followed for cardiovascular outcomes (follow-up of 
      3.13±1.15 years). RESULTS: Patients with more advanced CKD had lower sTWEAK levels. 
      sTWEAK concentrations were independently and negatively associated with carotid 
      intima-media thickness. sTWEAK levels were lower in patients with carotid 
      atherosclerotic plaques but not in those with femoral plaques. After adjustment by 
      confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for presenting carotid atherosclerotic plaques in 
      patients in the lowest versus highest tertile of sTWEAK was 4.18 (95% confidence 
      interval [95% CI], 2.89 to 6.08; P<0.001). Furthermore, sTWEAK levels were lower in 
      patients with calcified carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The OR for presenting 
      calcified carotid plaques was 1.77 (95% CI, 1.06 to 2.93; P=0.02) after 
      multivariable adjustment. After the follow-up, 41 fatal and 68 nonfatal 
      cardiovascular events occurred. In a Cox model, after controlling for potential 
      confounding factors, patients in the lowest tertile of sTWEAK concentrations had a 
      higher risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.40; 
      95% CI, 1.33 to 4.33; P=0.004) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.05 
      to 6.76; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Low sTWEAK levels were associated with the presence 
      of carotid atherosclerotic plaques in patients with CKD. Additionally, lower sTWEAK 
      levels were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Near-infrared spectroscopy revealed that the regional saturation of 
      oxygen (rSO(2)) in cerebral tissue is lower in hemodialysis (HD) patients than in 
      healthy subjects. However, no study has examined the changes in cerebral oxygenation 
      by aortic arch calcification (AAC) progression in HD patients. METHODS: A total of 
      104 HD patients were divided into four groups by AAC grade determined using chest 
      radiography: 23 patients at grade 0, 24 at grade 1, 30 at grade 2, and 27 at grade 
      3. Differences in clinical parameters, including cerebral rSO(2), among AAC grades 
      were investigated and atherosclerotic parameters affecting cerebral rSO(2) values 
      were identified. RESULTS: Cerebral rSO(2) significantly decreased as AAC progressed 
      (AAC grade 3 versus grade 0, p < 0.01 versus grade 1, p < 0.05). Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis was performed using parameters with p values < 0.20 in 
      univariate analysis between cerebral rSO(2) values less than the mean and 
      atherosclerotic parameters. AAC grades 2 and 3, serum phosphate level, and history 
      of smoking were factors associated with the cerebral rSO(2) decrease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cerebral rSO(2) significantly decreased as AAC progressed and was independently 
      associated with higher AAC grade, serum phosphate level, and history of smoking.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification (VC) scores determined by using simple plain 
      radiographic films are known to be associated with coronary artery disease and 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Omega-3 fatty acid (FA) has been 
      shown to reduce ectopic calcifications in an animal model, and it has also been 
      shown that erythrocyte membrane omega-3 FA content is an independent discriminator 
      of coronary artery disease. The present study was designed to demonstrate relations 
      between VC scores and erythrocyte membrane FA contents in patients undergoing HD. 
      DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out. SETTING: The study was carried out 
      at an outpatient hemodialysis unit at Dong-A University Hospital, Busan, Republic of 
      Korea. PATIENTS: A total of 31 patients undergoing HD were recruited. Patients with 
      significant malnutrition, a short duration of dialysis (<12 months), a history of 
      recent infection, malignancy, or liver disease were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Plain radiographic films of the feet, hands, pelvis, and lateral lumbar spine were 
      examined and VC scores were determined using previously reported methods. 
      Erythrocyte membrane FA contents were analyzed by gas chromatography. RESULTS: The 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were 
      not found to be related with VC on simple plain radiographic films. However, 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of oleic acid and total monounsaturated FA (MUFA) were 
      significantly higher in patients with significant VC scores. Furthermore, 
      erythrocyte membrane contents of MUFA and oleic acid were found to be negatively 
      associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and positively associated 
      with triglyceride level. CONCLUSION: Erythrocyte membrane contents of MUFA and oleic 
      acid were found to be associated with VC scores determined using plain radiographs 
      and with dyslipidemia in patients undergoing HD.

TI  - [Non invasive evaluation of vascular calcifications in patients on hemodyalisis].
PG  - 24-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are one of the main causes of morbidity and 
      mortality in dialysis patients. High incidence of cardiovascular diseases in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can not soley be explained by traditional 
      risk factors. Several studies have confirmed association between vascular 
      calcification and increased mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 
      total of 44 patients on chronic hemodialysis program, 18 women and 26 men, with 
      average age of 50.66 +/- 11.62 years and average duration of treatment of 
      100.25=52.83 months. We analyzed socio-demographic parameters and standard 
      laboratory findings. X-ray of hand and pelvis was obtained from each patient along 
      with echocardiography and carotid ultrasound imaging. To estimate the level of 
      vascular calcifications on the X-rays, we used the simple vascular score (sVC). 
      RESULTS: Using noninvasive methods, we found vascular calcifications in 26 (59%) 
      patients. In 22 (45%) patients, vascular calcifications were found in X-rays. Four 
      (9%) patients with vascular calcifications lacked any abnormality on X-rays but had 
      calcified plaques on carotid arteries or hart valves. In the group of patients that 
      had vascular calcifications, 3 (14%) patients had sVC score of 2,2 (9%) had score of 
      3,7 (32%) had score of 4,4 (18%) had score of 6, and 6 (27%) had sVC score of 8. 
      Comparing the group of patients with and without vascular calcifications, we found 
      statistically significant age difference (p<0.05) as well as difference in the 
      duration of hemodialysis (p<0.05). There were no other significant differences found 
      between the two groups. There is a statistically significant correlation between sVC 
      score and level of calcium (p<0.09) and iPTH (p<0.05). Using regression model for 
      increase of sVC score, we found significant correlation with duration of 
      hemodialysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Existence of vascular calcifications represents 
      warning sign of increased cardiovascular risk. Simple vascular score is an easy 
      method for assessing that risk. In our study, increased frequency of vascular 
      calcifications was directly correlated with older age and length of hemodialysis. 
      Standard X-rays, echocardiography and ultrasound imaging can be used in screening of 
      vascular calcifications. Among these methods, X-ray has advantage because it is 
      widely available and easy to interpret.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in CKD-5D  patients is tied to adverse cardiac 
      function  and increased mortality .
PG  - 291-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) and is an important predictor of mortality. 
      However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not been well 
      established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases mortality by 
      adversely affecting cardiac function. METHODS: Patients were recruited from 37 
      regional dialysis centers. 2-D and Doppler echocardiographic analyses were 
      performed, and CAC was measured using 64-slice computed tomography. Relationships 
      between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function were 
      analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: There 
      were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median age was 55 years, 
      and median duration of CKD-5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC scores 100 were found in 
      69% of patients, with 51% having a score  400. CAC was associated with measures of 
      LV systolic and diastolic function (global longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, 
      p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity (rho = -0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV 
      filling pressure (E:E'; rho = 0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed 
      these relationships after adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and 
      coronary artery disease. Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). 
      Both LV diastolic and systolic functional measures were significant predictors of 
      mortality, the strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings show a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD-5D. LV 
      diastolic function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent 
      predictors of mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in 
      CKD-5D. These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with 
      CKD-5D and describe a potentially-valuable role for echocardiography in the routine 
      management of these patients. .

      disease.
PG  - 1039-45
LID - 10.1038/ki.2014.372 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome 
      influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and 
      dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only 
      a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older 
      studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy 
      in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease 
      (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a 
      Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) 
      and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and 
      specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between 
      nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, 
      and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone 
      mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic 
      bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. 
      Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and 
      bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these 
      patients.

AB  - Chaga mushrooms are widely used in folk remedies and in alternative medicine. 
      Contrary to many beneficial effects, its adverse effect is rarely reported. We here 
      report a case of end-stage renal disease after long-term taking Chaga mushroom. A 
      49-year-old Korean man with end stage renal disease (ESRD) was transferred to our 
      hospital. Review of kidney biopsy finding was consistent with chronic 
      tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystal deposits and drug history revealed 
      long-term exposure to Chaga mushroom powder due to intractable atopic dermatitis. We 
      suspected the association between Chaga mushroom and oxalate nephropathy, and 
      measured the oxalate content of remained Chaga mushroom. The Chaga mushroom had 
      extremely high oxalate content (14.2/100 g). Estimated daily oxalate intake of our 
      case was 2 times for four years and 5 times for one year higher than that of usual 
      diet. Chaga mushroom is a potential risk factor of chronic kidney disease 
      considering high oxalate content. Nephrologist should consider oxalate nephropathy 
      in ESRD patients exposed to Chaga mushrooms.

TI  - Pre-existing Arterial Micro-Calcification Predicts Primary Unassisted Arteriovenous 
      Fistula Failure in Incident Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 665-9
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12365 [doi]
AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access 
      patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of arterial 
      micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD patients. 
      One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operation 
      were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial arterial 
      specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to identify AMiC. 
      We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between positive and 
      negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for evaluating risk 
      factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF failure occurred in 
      45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was greater in the positive 
      AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group had a lower AVF patency 
      rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The presence of AMiC was an 
      independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion, preexisting AMiC of the 
      vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF failure in incident HD 
      patients.

TI  - Hypervolemia rather than arterial calcification and extracoronary atherosclerosis is 
      the main determinant of pulse pressure in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1203-10
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0024-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulse pressure (PP) has been reported as an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. In this study, we aimed to 
      investigate association of PP with echocardiographic and vascular structural changes 
      such as atherosclerosis and arterial calcifications in HD patients. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 108 chronic hemodialysis patients (49 male, 
      59 female, mean age: 46 ± 13 years) were included. Biochemical analyses, 
      echocardiographic and high-resolution carotid Doppler examinations were done. Aortic 
      wall and coronary artery calcifications were measured with electron beam computed 
      tomography. The degree of carotid artery stenosis was measured at four different 
      sites (communis, bulbus, interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. RESULTS: PP 
      was strongly correlated with systolic (r: 0.82) and diastolic (r: 0.33) blood 
      pressure, left ventricular mass index (r: 0.58), left ventricle end diastolic 
      diameter (r: 0.38) and weakly correlated with aortic wall calcification score (r: 
      0.26) and carotid plaque score (r: 0.27), but not with coronary artery calcification 
      score. Patients with carotid plaque had higher PP than patients without plaque (50 ± 
      16 mmHg versus 44 ± 14 mmHg, P = 0.05). Patients were divided into three groups 
      according to aortic wall calcification score. PP was significantly higher in 
      patients with higher aortic wall calcification (54 ± 16 mmHg) than patients with 
      lower aortic wall calcification (44 ± 15 mmHg, P = 0.04). However, on multivariate 
      linear regression analysis for predicting PP, the only significant factor retained 
      was left ventricle end diastolic diameter. CONCLUSION: PP was weakly associated with 
      large vessel calcification and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. The bulk of 
      the effect on PP seems to be due to hypervolemia.

TI  - [Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) bone metabolism and vascular calcification 
      in hemodialyzed patients].
PG  - 703-6
AB  - Osteocalcin (OC) is witamino-K dependent calcium-binding protein comprising three 
      gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a strong bond with 
      hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone resorption 
      undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) appears in the blood. The aim of this study 
      was to evaluate the level of Glu-OC and markers of bone metabolism and their impact 
      on coronary artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure treated 
      with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients (29 women and 39 men) 
      aged 60.3 +/- 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/- 4.8 months. Control group 
      consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of age and gender. CACS was 
      evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Measurement of 
      carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and Glu-OC, bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), 
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were assessed by ELISA and iPTH by 
      Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the Gla-OC and Glu-OC in 
      hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the control group 116.37 +/- 
      70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/- 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/- 3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/- 2.63 
      ng/ ml; p <0.001. Glu-OC level correlated significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p 
      <0.001) and CaSc (p <0.014). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The results indicate a significant 
      correlation between Glu-OC and assessed markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has 
      indicated a link between bone metabolism and the degree of calcification in the 
      coronary arteries.

TI  - High Serum Sclerostin Levels Are Associated with a Better Outcome in Haemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1159/000443845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis. 
      Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification 
      (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin 
      levels are high. AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, 
      bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum 
      sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and 
      survival rate. RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin 
      level of 1.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum 
      sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were 
      significantly older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male 
      gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 
      ± 9 vs. 20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed 
      lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD 
      scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate 
      compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% 
      CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher 
      BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate.

TI  - Coronary calcifications and plaque characteristics in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease: a computed tomographic study.
PG  - 501-8
LID - 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283639eb3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, 
      atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 
      non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic 
      angiography. METHODS: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary 
      atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD 
      patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD controls 
      (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging 
      software. RESULTS: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques 
      (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium 
      content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score 
      correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non-ESRD, P<0.001 
      for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and 
      atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 
      vs. 0.804; P=0.574). CONCLUSION: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and 
      calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score 
      and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1111/nep.12210 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk 
      factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney 
      transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same 
      time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the 
      long-term. METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC 
      was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting 
      list. RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT 
      and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no 
      differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD 
      between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was 
      observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were 
      associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was 
      more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged 
      dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC 
      increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial 
      after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe 
      degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became 
      more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part 
      influenced by past dialysis experience.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common among patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and predicts the risk for cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD). We examined the associations of novel risk factors with CAC progression among 
      patients with CKD. METHODS: Among 1123 CKD patients in the Chronic Renal 
      Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, CAC was measured in Agatston units at baseline 
      and a follow-up visit using electron beam computed tomography or multidetector 
      computed tomography. RESULTS: Over an average 3.3-year follow-up, 109 (25.1%) 
      participants without CAC at baseline had incident CAC and 124 (18.0%) participants 
      with CAC at baseline had CAC progression, defined as an annual increase of ≥100 
      Agatston units. After adjustment for established atherosclerotic risk factors, 
      several novel risk factors were associated with changes in CAC over follow-up. 
      Changes in square root transformed CAC score associated with 1 SD greater level of 
      risk factors were -0.20 (95% confidence interval, -0.31 to -0.10; p < 0.001) for 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, 0.14 (0.02-0.25; p = 0.02) for 24-h urine 
      albumin, 0.25 (0.15-0.34; p < 0.001) for cystatin C, -0.17 (-0.27 to -0.07; p < 
      0.001) for serum calcium, 0.14 (0.03-0.24; p = 0.009) for serum phosphate, 0.24 
      (0.14-0.33; p < 0.001) for fibroblast growth factor-23, 0.13 (0.04-0.23; p = 0.007) 
      for total parathyroid hormone, 0.17 (0.07-0.27; p < 0.001) for interleukin-6, and 
      0.12 (0.02-0.22; p = 0.02) for tumor necrosis factor-α. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced kidney 
      function, calcium and phosphate metabolism disorders, and inflammation, independent 
      of established CVD risk factors, may progress CAC among CKD patients.

PG  - 207-213
AB  - The main aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of vascular calcifications 
      in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis in our population assessed by 
      X-ray. The secondary objectives were to determine the cardiovascular risk factors 
      associated with the presence of vascular calcifications and to evaluate the 
      complementary use of the echocardiogram in a cross-sectional, observational, 
      multicentric study. We included patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, 
      age =18 years with at least 3 months of renal replacement therapy in 8 dialysis 
      centres in Argentina. The degree of vascular calcification was determined using 
      Adragao and Kauppila scores. The presence of valvular calcifications was established 
      through a trans-thoracic doppler echocardiogram. Univariate and multivariate 
      analysis were undertaken, considering the degree of vascular calcification as the 
      dependent variable; 443 adult patients were evaluated at 8 centres across 5 
      provinces in Argentina. The prevalence of vascular calcifications by the X-rays was 
      63%, while 73% presented calcifications in hands and pelvis, with an Adragao score > 
      3, and 60% presented calcifications in the abdominal aorta with a Kauppila score > 
      4. The prevalence of valvular calcifications: 28%. We have shown a higher rate of 
      vascular calcifications with the use of plain X-rays when compared to the prevalence 
      of valvular calcifications obtained with echocardiograms. In this regard, valvular 
      calcifications were present particularly in those patients with a severe level of 
      radiological vascular calcification.

AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. The 
      Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in 
      CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible association of circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signaling 
      inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in predialysis CKD. 
      Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B 
      (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were 
      analyzed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip 
      (TH), and forearm (FARM). Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour 
      analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between 
      sclerostin and age (r = 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p 
      = 0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association 
      between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between 
      sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In 
      contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative 
      association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the 
      Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to 
      establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in 
      CKD.

TI  - The relationship between coronary artery calcium scores and left atrium size in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1661-1666
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1620-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hemodialysis patients have extremely increased cardiovascular mortality. 
      The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in uremic patients receiving 
      hemodialysis reflects the severity of atherosclerotic vascular disease and predicts 
      the cardiovascular events. In cardiac conditions, left atrial (LA) size has a 
      prognostic importance. In this study, relationship between coronary artery 
      calcification and left atrial size was investigated. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study involving 32 hemodialysis patients (16 females, 16 males; mean 
      age, 52.4 ± 14.1 years) receiving HD for ≥6 months. Coronary artery calcium scoring 
      was performed by a 16-MDCT scanner, and CACS was calculated by Agatston score. A 
      calcification was defined as a minimum of two adjacent pixels (>0.52 mm(2)) with a 
      density over 130 Hounsfield units. Patients were divided into two subgroups (group 
      1: CACS ≤ 45.85, n = 16 and group 2: CACS > 45.85, n = 16) according to median CACS 
      value. RESULTS: Mean CACS value of 32 hemodialysis patients was 245.57 ± 373.91. LA 
      size was significantly higher in patients with CACS > 45.85 (group 2) than in 
      patients with CACS ≤ 45.85 (group 1). In the bivariate correlation analysis, total 
      CACS was positively correlated with left atrium size (r = 0.47, p = 0.006). Total 
      CACS was positively correlated with age (r = 0.43, p = 0.014). LA size was 
      positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.42, p = 0.016) and 
      negatively correlated with ejection fraction (r = -0.42, p = 0.016). The clinical 
      parameters such as BMI, duration of dialysis, blood pressure, ejection fraction, 
      serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, albumin, CRP, triglyceride, 
      cholesterol, hemoglobin and ferritin were not independently associated with total 
      CACS. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive relationship between the CACS and LA size 
      measured by echocardiography in hemodialysis patients. Therefore; echocardiography, 
      which is cheaper and non-invasive than tomographic examinations, might be considered 
      for the risk stratification of coronary artery disease in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Impact of circulating cathepsin K on the coronary calcification and the clinical 
      outcome in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 6-14
LID - 10.1007/s00380-014-0570-z [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a cause of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and 
      an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events 
      (MACCE). Cathepsin K (CatK) is a lysosomal cysteine protease which affects vascular 
      calcification and glucose metabolism disorder. We investigated the relationships 
      among CatK, CAC, diabetes mellitus (DM) and MACCE in CKD patients. 113 consecutive 
      CKD patients were enrolled. Their CAC was evaluated by computed tomography. Their 
      plasma CatK level was measured by ELISA. They were divided into two groups by CatK 
      levels and followed up for up to 3 years. The impact of CatK was analyzed in all 
      participants, diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
      demonstrated a significant higher incidence of MACCE in the high CatK group (P = 
      0.028). The CatK level was significantly higher in patients with MACCE compared to 
      that in patients without MACCE (P = 0.034). Cox's model revealed the higher plasma 
      CatK and BNP level as independent predictors of MACCE (P = 0.043 and P < 0.01, 
      respectively). Only in non-diabetic patients, there was a significant correlation 
      between CatK and CAC score, and high CatK group had a significant higher level of 
      LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) than low CatK 
      group. And these lipid disorders were independent predictors of CatK elevation. In 
      CKD patients, our results indicated an impact of higher CatK level on their MACCE. 
      The significant association among the CatK level, CAC and MACCE was found in 
      non-diabetic CKD patients.

TI  - High estimated glomerular filtration rate is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification in middle-aged Korean men without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 996-1001
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as well as low eGFR is 
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vascular calcification is a 
      suggested link between low eGFR and worse cardiovascular outcome. However, the 
      association between high eGFR and vascular calcification is not known. The aim of 
      this study is to investigate the relationship between high eGFR and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed middle-aged Korean 
      men in whom coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) and eGFR were measured as part of 
      a health examination program in Korea. Participants with underlying chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer were excluded. CAC was 
      defined as a CACS >100. RESULTS: Among 6986 subjects [age 48.1 (46.5-50.5) years], 
      321 (4.6%) participants had CAC. The percentages of participants with CAC were 5.7, 
      3.8, 4.9 and 6.6 in groups with eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) of 60 ∼ 74, 75 ∼ 89, 90 ∼ 
      104 and 105 ∼ max, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, the odds ratio 
      for CAC in the group with eGFR of 105 ∼ max compared with the group with eGFR of 75 
      ∼ 89 was 2.52 (1.67-3.79, P < 0.001) after adjustment for age, body mass index, 
      diabetes, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, glucose, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, hsCRP, calcium, 
      phosphorus, current smoking, alcohol intake and vigorous exercise frequency. 
      CONCLUSIONS: High eGFR is associated with CAC in middle-aged Korean men without CKD. 
      Further studies are needed to verify a causal relationship and clarify the role of 
      high eGFR in the development of CVD.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
      with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-41

AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role 
      of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess 
      the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular 
      calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients. METHODS: Left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D echocardiography. Intact FGF23 
      blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, 
      USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial 
      stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). 
      Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragão score. RESULTS: In 
      unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 
      0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), 
      dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was 
      negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = 
      -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted 
      analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (β = 
      0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, 
      gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic 
      blood pressure. There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in 
      multivariable- adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is 
      associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or 
      vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Candidate gene association study of coronary artery calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease: findings from the CRIC study (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify loci for coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). BACKGROUND: CKD is associated 
      with increased CAC and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms 
      remain poorly defined. Genetic studies of CAC in CKD may provide a useful strategy 
      for identifying novel pathways in CHD. METHODS: We performed a candidate gene study 
      (∼2,100 genes; ∼50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) of CAC within the 
      CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study (N = 1,509; 57% European, 43% 
      African ancestry). SNPs with preliminary evidence of association with CAC in CRIC 
      were examined for association with CAC in the PennCAC (Penn Coronary Artery 
      Calcification) (N = 2,560) and AFCS (Amish Family Calcification Study) (N = 784) 
      samples. SNPs with suggestive replication were further analyzed for association with 
      myocardial infarction (MI) in the PROMIS (Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction 
      Study) (N = 14,885). RESULTS: Of 268 SNPs reaching p < 5 × 10(-4) for CAC in CRIC, 
      28 SNPs in 23 loci had nominal support (p < 0.05 and in same direction) for CAC in 
      PennCAC or AFCS. Besides chr9p21 and COL4A1, known loci for CHD, these included SNPs 
      having reported genome-wide association study association with hypertension (e.g., 
      ATP2B1). In PROMIS, 4 of the 23 suggestive CAC loci (chr9p21, COL4A1, ATP2B1, and 
      ABCA4) had significant associations with MI, consistent with their direction of 
      effect on CAC. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several loci associated with CAC in CKD 
      that also relate to MI in a general population sample. CKD imparts a high risk of 
      CHD and may provide a useful setting for discovery of novel CHD genes and pathways.

TI  - Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant 
      coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis 
      patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of 
      these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy 
      studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we 
      hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be 
      predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. METHODS: All 
      patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI 
      with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent 
      CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified 
      using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC 
      and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients 
      were included in this study (71% male, 67 ± 7 years old). Forty-six patients were 
      found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with 
      CAD (10.1 ± 4.9 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed 
      that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold 
      higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% 
      and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is 
      predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic 
      dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could 
      contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of 
      CAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ; ISRCTN20479861 , registered

      (HD) patients. METHODS: Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers assay. RESULTS: The A 
      allele frequency of rs7895833 and G allele frequency of rs7069102 were significantly 
      lower in HD patients (0.228 and 0.131, respectively) than those in 803 control 
      subjects (general population) (0.289 and 0.181, respectively) (P = .010 and P = 
      .012, respectively). However, the allele frequency of rs2273773 was not 
      significantly different from that in the control subjects. Multivariate analysis 
      adjusted for age and duration on HD demonstrated that the serum levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly high in G allele carriers of 
      rs7069102 compared with CC genotype in male HD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcification score was significantly high in C allele carriers of rs2273773 in all 
      and male HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT 1 polymorphisms, rs7069102 and rs2273773, 
      are associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism and coronary artery 
      calcification, respectively, in Japanese HD patients, especially in males.

TI  - The sleeve method for creation of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas in patients 
      with calcified vessels.
PG  - 384-389
LID - 10.5301/jva.5000761 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in patients with advanced 
      atherosclerotic changes of the artery is often a challenge for the physician due to 
      difficulties in suturing the vein to the side of the frangible artery. The sleeve 
      technique relies on advancing the end of the artery into the lumen of the vein and 
      protecting the anastomosis by adventitial sutures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sleeve 
      technique was performed in 23 patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV and V 
      and included hemodialysis patients. Their mean age was 60.8 ± 14.8 years and 
      hemodialysis treatment time 49.8 ± 40.2 months. The most frequent causes of chronic 
      kidney disease are ischemic nephropathy (43%, n = 10) and type l diabetes (21%, n = 
      5). Only patients with extremely advanced atherosclerotic were recruited and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: The primary patency rate was 67%, 59%, 44% and 28% at 6, 12, 24, 
      and 36 months, respectively. The secondary patency rate was 67%, 61%, 50% and 37% at 
      6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. In three patients the AVF failed directly 
      after the operation. Delayed fistula failure occurred in seven patients. The overall 
      success in the creation of a functioning fistula was achieved in 15 of the 23 
      patients (65%). No serious complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with calcified atherosclerotic plaques, which constitute a barrier or make it 
      difficult to suture the vein to the side of the artery, the sleeve method may be 
      considered as an alternative before abandoning the creation of a fistula on the 
      forearm. The technique is much simpler than the standard end-to-side or side-to-side 
      anastomosis.

TI  - Epicardial adipose tissue in long-term hemodialysis patients: its association with 
      vascular calcification and long-term development.
PG  - 241-250
LID - 10.1007/s40620-015-0221-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) in the general population. EAT is suggested to promote CAD by 
      paracrine mechanisms and local inflammation. We evaluated whether in chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients EAT associates with CAD, how the amount of EAT develops 
      over time, and if EAT independently predicts the mortality risk. METHODS: Post-hoc 
      analysis of a prospective study in 59 chronic HD patients who underwent non-enhanced 
      multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) at baseline. Thirty-seven patients underwent 
      another MSCT after 24 ± 5 months. We measured EAT volume (cm³) and Agatston 
      calcification scores of coronary arteries (CAC) and aortic valves (AVC). All-cause 
      mortality was assessed after a follow-up of 88 months (IQR 52-105). RESULTS: 
      Baseline EAT was 128.2 ± 60.8 cm³ and significantly higher than in a control group 
      of non-renal patients (94 ± 46 cm³; p < 0.05). Median Agatston score for CAC was 329 
      (IQR 23-1181) and for AVC was 0 (IQR 0-25.3) in HD patients. We observed significant 
      positive correlations between baseline EAT and age (r = 0.386; p = 0.003), BMI (r = 
      0.314; p = 0.016), CAC (r = 0.278; p = 0.03), and AVC (r = 0.282; p = 0.03). In 
      multivariate analysis, age, BMI and AVC remained as significant predictors of EAT (p 
      < 0.01). Calcification scores significantly increased over 2 years; in contrast EAT 
      change was not significant (+11 %, IQR -10 to 24 %; p = 0.066). The limited patient 
      number in the present study precludes analysis of the EAT impact upon survival. 
      CONCLUSION: EAT correlated significantly with cardiovascular calcification in 
      long-term HD patients. Mean EAT did not significantly change over 2 years.

TI  - Surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in patients 
      with renal dysfunction and/or aortic arch calcification.
PG  - 444-447
AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors recently reported that the presence of chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) and/or extended abdominal aortic calcification was associated with 
      significantly worse clinical outcomes after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. CKD 
      is one of the highest risk factors for systemic atherosclerosis. Therefore, impaired 
      blood flow due to atherosclerosis could exacerbate degeneration of the cervical 
      spine and neural tissue. However, there has been no report of a study evaluating the 
      deleterious effects of CKD and atherosclerosis on the outcomes after decompression 
      surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. The purpose of this study was thus to 
      examine whether CKD and systemic atherosclerosis affect surgical outcomes after 
      laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). METHODS The authors analyzed 
      data from 127 consecutive cases involving patients who underwent laminoplasty for 
      CSM and met their inclusion criteria. Stage 3-4 CKD was present as a preoperative 
      comorbidity in 44 cases. Clinical status was assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic 
      Association (JOA) cervical myelopathy evaluation questionnaire before surgery and 2 
      years postoperatively. As a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, the presence of 
      aortic arch calcification (AoAC) was assessed on preoperative chest radiographs. 
      RESULTS AoAC was found on preoperative chest radiographs in 40 of 127 patients. 
      Neither CKD nor AoAC had a statistically significant deleterious effect on 
      preoperative JOA score. However, CKD and AoAC were significantly associated with 
      reductions in both the JOA score recovery rate (mean 36.1% in patients with CKD vs 
      44.7% in those without CKD; 26.0% in patients with AoAC vs 48.9% in those without 
      AoAC) and the change in JOA score at 2 years after surgery (mean 2.3 points in 
      patients with CKD vs 3.1 points in those without CKD; 2.1 points for patients with 
      AoAC vs 3.2 points for those without AoAC). A multivariate regression analysis 
      showed that AoAC was a significant independent predictor of poor outcome with 
      respect to both for the difference between follow-up and preoperative JOA scores and 
      the JOA score recovery rate. CONCLUSIONS CKD and AoAC were associated with increased 
      rates of poor neurological outcomes after laminoplasty for CSM, and AoAC was a 
      significant independent predictive factor for poor outcome.

TI  - Severe hypovitaminosis D in chronic kidney disease: association with blood pressure 
      and coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 428-32
LID - 10.1038/hr.2012.230 [doi]
AB  - Hypovitaminosis D occurs early in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 
      its association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well known. In this 
      study, we aimed to evaluate whether the degree of hypovitaminosis D may differently 
      affect blood pressure (BP) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in nondialyzed 
      CKD patients. This study included 80 CKD patients with a creatinine clearance 
      between 15 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and serum 25 hydroxivitamin D [25(OH)D] level 
      <30 ng/ml. Patients underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, evaluation of CAC 
      (multi-slice computed tomography), and laboratory evaluation. Two groups, based on 
      the degree of hypovitaminosis D, were defined according to the median 25(OH)D value. 
      Patients with severe hypovitaminosis D [25(OH)D <17.2 ng/ml; S-group) exhibited a 
      higher systolic BP at all time periods (24-h, nighttime, daytime) when compared to 
      patients with mild hypovitaminosis D [25(OH)D >17.2 ng/ml; M-group]. No differences 
      were found between the S and M-group in terms of diastolic BP and the presence of 
      coronary calcification. In the multiple linear regression analysis, severe 
      hypovitaminosis D was a predictor of 24-h, daytime and nighttime BP after 
      controlling for a number of confounders. The severity of hypovitaminosis D was 
      associated with increased BP in nondialyzed CKD patients. The degree of 
      hypovitaminosis D was not related to CAC, which was equally elevated in both the 
      severe and mild hypovitaminosis D groups.

TI  - Serum Surfactant Protein D is Associated with Atherosclerosis of the Carotid Artery 
      in Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) is an inflammatory modulator that has been 
      associated with cardiovascular disease-related mortality, estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, and major adverse cardiac events in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between SP-D level and 
      atherosclerosis in patients on hemodialysis. METHODS: A total of 116 patients 
      undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were recruited to this cross-sectional study. As 
      a marker of atherosclerosis, the carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) was 
      measured by high-resolution ultrasonography, and the coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) score was determined by multislice computed tomography. Serum SP-D levels were 
      measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: In patients 
      on long-term hemodialysis, the mean serum SP-D level was 192.9 +/- 89.6 pg/mL 
      (range: 89-537 pg/mL). The serum SP-D level exhibited positive correlations with 
      CA-IMT (r = 0.497, p < 0.0001) and severe CAC (r = 0.352, p = 0.02), which persisted 
      after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The SP-D level showed positive 
      correlations with carotid CA-IMT and CAC in patients on long-term hemodialysis. 
      Therefore, SP-D may be a novel marker of atherosclerosis in patients with 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal aortic calcification at different stages of chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 2061-2068
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcifications that may cause cardiovascular disease are highly 
      prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to determine 
      abdominal aorta calcifications (AAC) in predialysis and hemodialysis patients by 
      lateral lumbar radiography and to investigate factors that were associated with the 
      calcifications. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-nine adult chronic hemodialysis 
      patients, 300 predialysis CKD patients and 60 healthy subjects with normal kidney 
      function as a control group were enrolled in the study. Lateral lumbar radiography 
      was used to measure AAC. Calcified deposits of the abdominal aorta wall at the level 
      of the first through fourth lumbar vertebrae were graded by a 24-point scoring 
      system. RESULTS: AAC prevalence (AAC score ≥1) was significantly different in 
      hemodialysis, predialysis and control groups (71.8, 45.7 and 33.3 %, respectively; 
      p < 0.001). AAC prevalence in CKD stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 predialysis patients was 
      26.6, 43.3, 40, 58.3 and 55 %, respectively. AAC scores of the hemodialysis group 
      were higher than of the predialysis group (p < 0.001) and the control group 
      (p < 0.001). AAC scores of the predialysis group were not higher than of the control 
      group (p = 0.314). AAC scores of the hemodialysis group were significantly higher 
      than of the control group (p < 0.001) and stage 1 (p < 0.001), stage 2 (p = 0.001) 
      and stage 3 predialysis groups (p = 0.002). Age (p < 0.001), presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (p < 0.001) and serum phosphorus levels (p = 0.011) were found to be 
      independent predictors of calcification in the hemodialysis group. Age (p < 0.001), 
      serum phosphorus levels (p = 0.007) and history of cardiovascular disease 
      (p = 0.014) were found to be independent predictors of calcification in the 
      predialysis group. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal aortic calcification is highly prevalent 
      in the hemodialysis population. Strict phosphorus control should be implemented to 
      the predialysis and hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification scores improve contrast-induced nephropathy risk 
      assessment in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1007/s10157-016-1298-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The 
      aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of CAC scores for the 
      incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac catheterization in 
      non-dialyzed CKD patients. METHODS: The present study evaluated a total of 140 CKD 
      patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients were stratified into two 
      groups based on the optimal cut-off value of the CAC score, which was graded by a 
      non-triggered, routine diagnostic chest computed tomography scan: CAC score ≥8 (high 
      CAC group); and CAC score <8 (low CAC group). CIN was defined as an increase 
      of >10 % in the baseline serum cystatin C level at 24 h after contrast 
      administration. RESULTS: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate levels were 
      41.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the mean contrast dose administered was 37.5 mL. Patients 
      with high CAC scores exhibited a higher incidence of CIN than patients with low CAC 
      scores (25.5 vs. 3.2 %, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment for confounders, 
      the CAC score predicted CIN (odds ratio 1.68, 95 % confidence interval 1.28-2.21, 
      p < 0.001). Moreover, the C-index for CIN prediction significantly increased when 
      the CAC scores were added to the Mehran risk score (0.855 vs. 0.760, p = 0.023). 
      CONCLUSION: CAC scores, as evaluated using semi-quantitative methods, are a simple 
      and powerful predictor of CIN. Incorporating the CAC score in the Mehran risk score 
      significantly improved the predictive ability to predict CIN incidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) 
      is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by 
      cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality. METHODS: In 231 ESRD 
      patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, 
      prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were 
      quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of 
      total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were 
      also analysed. RESULTS: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more 
      often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 
      and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox 
      proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause 
      mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and 
      subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) 
      showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly 
      associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from 
      DXA. CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of 
      agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than 
      those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with 
      high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an 
      important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

TI  - The Addition of Vascular Calcification Scores to Traditional Risk Factors Improves 
      Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - e0131707

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a variety of non-invasive methods for measuring cardiovascular 
      (CV) risk (such as carotid intima media thickness, pulse wave velocity (PWV), 
      coronary artery and aortic calcification scores (measured either by CT scan or 
      X-ray) and the ankle brachial index (ABI)) have been evaluated separately in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) cohorts, few studies have evaluated these methods 
      simultaneously. Here, we looked at whether the addition of non-invasive methods to 
      traditional risk factors (TRFs) improves prediction of the CV risk in patients at 
      different CKD stages. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 
      the relationship between the outputs of non-invasive measurement methods on one hand 
      and mortality and CV outcomes in 143 patients at different CKD stages on the other. 
      During the follow-up period, 44 patients died and 30 CV events were recorded. We 
      used Cox models to calculate the relative risk for outcomes. To assess the putative 
      clinical value of each method, we also determined the categorical net 
      reclassification improvement (NRI) and the integrated discrimination improvement. 
      RESULTS: Vascular calcification, PWV and ABI predicted all-cause mortality and CV 
      events in univariate analyses. However, after adjustment for TRFs, only aortic and 
      coronary artery calcification scores were found to be significant, independent 
      variables. Moreover, the addition of coronary artery calcification scores to TRFs 
      improved the specificity of prediction by 20%. CONCLUSION: The addition of vascular 
      calcification scores (especially the coronary artery calcification score) to TRFs 
      appears to improve CV risk assessment in a CKD population.

TI  - Aortic Arch Calcification as a Predictor of Repeated Arteriovenous Fistula Failure 
      within 1-Year in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 6728437

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify the factors associated with 
      repeated arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure within 1-year, especially the impact of 
      aortic arch calcification (AAC) on patency of AVF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      retrospectively assessed chest radiography in hemodialysis patients who had 
      undergone initial AVF. The extent of AAC was categorized into four grades (0-3). The 
      association between AAC grade, other clinical variables, and repeated failure of AVF 
      was then analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This study 
      included 284 patients (158 males, mean age 61.7 ± 13.1 years). Patients with higher 
      AAC grade were older, had more frequently diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular 
      disease, had lower diastolic blood pressure, and had higher corrected calcium and 
      lower intact parathyroid hormone levels. In multivariate analysis, the presence of 
      higher AAC grade (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.98 (1.43-6.23); p = 
      0.004), lower mean corrected calcium (p = 0.017), and mean serum albumin level (p = 
      0.008) were associated with repeated failure of AVF. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 
      higher AAC grade, lower mean corrected calcium and mean serum albumin level were 
      independently associated with repeated AVF failure within 1 year in hemodialysis 
      patients.

TI  - A Nationally Representative Study of Calcific Uremic Arteriolopathy Risk Factors.
PG  - 3421-3429
AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is 
      necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated 
      whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would identify patients 
      at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using data from a large 
      dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) 
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race 
      in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients 
      and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively; 67% of participants were women and 
      49% were white. Median duration between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA 
      development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; 
      higher levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and 
      nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with 
      increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes 
      receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a 
      dose-response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh 
      areas (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for more 
      than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between 
      recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years 
      before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of preventive 
      strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Lower serum magnesium is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and mortality 
      in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 244-52
LID - 10.1159/000366124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypomagnesaemia is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in the general 
      population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      pre-dialysis magnesium (Mg) and CV risk markers, [including pulse pressure (PP), 
      left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and vascular calcifications (VC)], and mortality 
      in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a 48-month prospective study 
      in 206 patients under pre-dilution haemodiafiltration with a dialysate Mg 
      concentration of 1 mmol/l. RESULTS: Lower Mg concentrations were predictors of an 
      increased PP (≥65 mm Hg) (p = 0.002) and LVMI (≥140 g/m(2)) (p = 0.03) and of a 
      higher VC score (≥3) (p = 0.01). Patients with Mg <1.15 mmol/l had a lower survival 
      at the end of the study (p = 0.01). Serum Mg <1.15 mmol/l was an independent 
      predictor of all-cause (p = 0.01) and CV mortality (p = 0.02) when adjusted for 
      multiple CV risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Lower Mg levels seem to be associated with 
      increased CV risk markers, like PP, LVMI and VC, and with higher mortality in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Arterial microcalcification in atherosclerotic patients with and without chronic 
      kidney disease: a comparative high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction analysis.
PG  - 465-72
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9594-5 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, albeit heterogeneous in terms of biological and 
      physicochemical properties, has been associated with ageing, lifestyle, diabetes, 
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unknown whether or not moderately impaired 
      renal function (CKD stages 2-4) affects the physiochemical composition and/or the 
      formation of magnesium-containing tricalcium phosphate ([Ca,Mg](3)[PO(4)](2), 
      whitlockite) in arterial microcalcification. Therefore, a high-resolution scanning 
      X-ray diffraction analysis (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, 
      France) utilizing histological sections of paraffin-embedded arterial specimens 
      derived from atherosclerotic patients with normal renal function (n = 15) and CKD 
      (stages 2-4, n = 13) was performed. This approach allowed us to spatially assess the 
      contribution of calcium phosphate (apatite) and whitlockite to arterial 
      microcalcification. Per group, the number of samples (13 vs. 12) with sufficient 
      signal intensity and total lengths of regions (201 vs. 232 μm) giving rise to 
      diffractograms ("informative regions") were comparable. Summarizing all informative 
      regions per group into one composite sample revealed calcium phosphate/apatite as 
      the leading mineral phase in CKD patients, whereas in patients with normal renal 
      function the relative contribution of whitlockite and calcium phosphate/apatite was 
      on the same order of magnitude (CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 157 μm, whitlockite 
      38.7 μm; non-CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 79.0 μm, whitlockite 94.1 μm; each p < 
      0.05). Our results, although based on a limited number of samples, indicate that 
      chronic impairment of renal function affects local magnesium homeostasis and thus 
      contributes to the physicochemical composition of microcalcification in 
      atherosclerotic patients.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease, plasma lipoproteins, and coronary artery calcium incidence: 
      the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 652-8
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.300624 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of chronic kidney disease and coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC) incidence, and the distribution of lipoproteins across 
      categories of kidney function and their association with CAC risk. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We analyzed data from 2795 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis with no CAC (calcium score=0) at baseline enrolled at the first 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis visit between the years 2000 and 2002. During 
      a median follow-up of 2.4 years, incident calcium (calcium score>0 at follow-up) 
      developed in 12%, 19%, and 27% of participants with a cystatin-c estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate (mL/min per 1.73 m)(2) of ≥90, 60 to 89, and 30 to 59 (P 
      for difference <0.001), respectively. Compared with those with normal kidney 
      function (estimated glomerular filtration rate≥90), adjusted CAC incidence risk 
      ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: 1.26 (95% CI, 
      1.04-1.52), and 1.56 (95% CI, 1.11-2.20; P(trend)=0.014) in those with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 60 to 89 and 30 to 59, respectively. These 
      associations were attenuated after adjusting for a characteristic and strongly 
      interrelated lipid phenotype (principal component 1), which was more common in those 
      with chronic kidney disease and characterized by a predominance of triglyceride-rich 
      lipoproteins: CAC incidence risk ratios=1.21 (95% CI, 1.00-1.46) and 1.44 (95% CI, 
      1.02-2.04; P(trend)=0.06) in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 to 
      89 and 30 to 59, respectively, after adjusting for principal component 1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with CAC incidence. Part 
      of this association is mediated through a characteristic lipid phenotype comprising 
      elevations in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

TI  - Prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in hemodialysis patients--a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0026-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery calcification has been reported to be an independent 
      risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also, existence of a positive correlation has been 
      reported between the presence of arterial calcification and that of ischemic changes 
      in the area supplied by such arteries. While intracranial artery calcification has 
      frequently been observed on computed tomographic (CT) images of the brain in 
      hemodialysis patients, its prevalence has not been reported previously. We 
      investigated our hemodialysis outpatients to determine the prevalence of 
      intracranial artery calcification in these patients in comparison with that in 
      healthy controls. METHODS: Brain CT examinations were performed in 107 patients 
      under maintenance hemodialysis therapy. For comparison, 43 representatives of the 
      general population who underwent a brain CT examination as part of a health checkup 
      were also studied as control subjects. RESULTS: Intracranial calcifications were 
      more frequently found among hemodialysis patients (87.9%) than among control 
      subjects (53.5%, P = 0.0003), and the prevalences of calcification in each of the 
      intracranial arteries in the two groups were as follows: vertebral artery (65.5% vs. 
      25.6%, P = 0.0002), internal carotid artery (62.1% vs. 18.6%, P < 0.0001), basilar 
      artery (34.5% vs. 34.9%, ns), anterior cerebral artery (0 vs. 2.3%, ns), middle 
      cerebral artery (24.1% vs. 20.9%, ns), and posterior cerebral artery (5.2% vs. 4.7%, 
      ns). CONCLUSIONS: A much higher rate of intracranial artery calcification was 
      observed in hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and the most 
      frequently involved sites of calcification in these patients were the relatively 
      large intracranial arteries.

AB  - Calcification of coronary vessels progresses rapidly in hemodialysis (HD) patients 
      and comprises a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. The aim of this 
      prospective study was to evaluate the coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 
      patients with end stage renal disease undergoing regular HD and to determine the 
      effect of renal transplantation (RT) in the progression of CAC, using the Agatston 
      technique for calcium scoring. The study included 20 patients with end-stage renal 
      disease undergoing a regular HD treatment (16 males, 4 females) 54.1 ± 9.5 years old 
      who had just received a renal transplant and 16 more HD patients (11 males, 5 
      females) 54.4 ± 13.8 years old as control group. The baseline evaluation showed a 
      very high prevalence of CAC in both groups, which was positively correlated with age 
      (p < 0.001) and CRP (p = 0.03). The second (follow-up) evaluation showed a 
      significant slower progression of calcification after RT. In both groups, high 
      calcium score values in the follow-up evaluation had a strong positive correlation 
      with baseline calcium score (p < 0.001).

PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1159/000345172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated arterial aging and inadequate outward arterial remodeling 
      are observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Whether these changes could 
      be closely associated with arterial calcifications has never been investigated. 
      METHODS: 155 ESRD patients and 105 age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched control 
      subjects were included. Common carotid artery (CCA) pressure, diameter, intima-media 
      thickness, elastic modulus, and presence of calcified plaques were measured 
      ultrasonographically. Carotid artery stiffness was determined from simultaneously 
      recorded CCA diameter and stroke changes in diameter and CCA pressure waveforms, 
      obtained by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, ESRD 
      patients had increased CCA systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.001), larger CCA 
      diameter (p < 0.001) and CCA intima-media thickness (p < 0.01) and similar CCA 
      relative wall thickness. In ESRD patients the arterial remodeling was associated 
      with increased CCA elastic modulus/stiffness (p < 0.001). In ESRD patients the 
      association between CCA elastic modulus and age was characterized by a steeper slope 
      (p = 0.03), but after separation of uremic patients according to the presence of 
      calcifications, the accelerated aging was observed only in calcified subjects. 
      Despite higher CCA systolic and pulse pressures, the CCA relative wall thickness was 
      similar to controls indicating an inadequate pressure-associated remodeling. 
      Moreover, the positive systolic pressure/relative thickness correlation observed in 
      control subjects was lost with paradoxical negative correlation in calcified ESRD 
      patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in ESRD patients, 
      accelerated arterial aging and inadequate arterial hypertrophy are closely 
      associated with the calcifications of arterial walls. Inadequate hypertrophy is 
      responsible for high circumferential stress applied on the vessels.

TI  - Clinical management of calcific uremic arteriolopathy before and after therapeutic 
      inclusion of bisphosphonates.
PG  - 231-4
LID - 10.5414/CN107923 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a 
      life-threatening condition almost exclusively affecting patients with end-stage 
      renal failure. Several therapies have been employed to treat this disease with 
      irregular results. METHODS: Comparison of a prospective case series with a 
      historical cohort. Group I: 12 patients with CUA diagnosed before 2002 (5 men, 6 on 
      dialysis and 6 with functioning allografts) treated with standard treatment. Group 
      II: 11 patients with CUA diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 (4 men, 6 on dialysis and 5 
      with functioning allografts) treated with standard treatment and bisphosphonates for 
      6 months. The diagnosis was made by clinical suspicion and a confirmatory biopsy in 
      both groups. Ten patients had a previous history of high calcium-phosphorus product, 
      9 had a history of high parathyroid hormone (> 800 pg/ml) levels, 13 had a history 
      of high cumulative steroids and 9 patients were under dicoumarin treatment. Two 
      patients were obese and 5 had diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: In Group I, 58.7% required 
      amputation of the affected limb, 3 patients recovered and 2 died. In all patients of 
      Group II the progression of the skin lesions decreased between 2 and 4 weeks after 
      the start of bisphosphonate therapy with no changes in blood levels of calcium and 
      phosphate. The improvement in pain and lesions was faster in the patients receiving 
      endovenous bisphosphonates. Renal function remained stable in transplant recipients. 
      No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates could constitute an 
      alternative to treat CUA in addition to standard therapy.

TI  - The Association of Coronary Artery Calcium With Noncardiovascular Disease: The 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 568-576
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if coronary artery calcium (CAC) is 
      associated with incident noncardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: CAC is considered a 
      measure of vascular aging, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. The relationship with noncardiovascular disease is not well 
      defined. METHODS: A total of 6,814 participants from 6 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis) field centers were followed for a median of 10.2 years. Modified 
      Cox proportional hazards ratios accounting for the competing risk of fatal coronary 
      heart disease were calculated for new diagnoses of cancer, pneumonia, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein 
      thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, and dementia. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age; sex; race; socioeconomic status; health insurance status; body mass index; 
      physical activity; diet; tobacco use; number of medications used; systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure; total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 
      antihypertensive, aspirin, and cholesterol medication; and diabetes. The outcome was 
      first incident noncardiovascular disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with those 
      with CAC = 0, those with CAC >400 had an increased hazard of cancer (hazard ratio 
      [HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 1.99), CKD (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.21 
      to 2.39), pneumonia (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.82), COPD (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.60 
      to 4.57), and hip fracture (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 1.47 to 12.50). CAC >400 was not 
      associated with dementia or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Those with 
      CAC = 0 had decreased risk of cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), CKD (HR: 
      0.77; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), COPD (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), and hip fracture 
      (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.70) compared to those with CAC >0. CAC = 0 was 
      not associated with less pneumonia, dementia, or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary 
      embolism. The results were attenuated, but remained significant, after removing 
      participants developing interim nonfatal coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants with elevated CAC were at increased risk of cancer, CKD, COPD, and hip 
      fractures. Those with CAC = 0 are less likely to develop common age-related comorbid 
      conditions, and represent a unique population of "healthy agers."

PG  - 344-51
LID - 10.1038/ki.2012.118 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery disease is a serious complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD); 
      however, there is little information about coronary plaque morphology in these 
      patients. Here we identified the characteristics of coronary culprit plaques and 
      their clinical manifestations in 78 patients with CKD divided into four groups based 
      on their estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients were examined by Virtual 
      Histology-Intravascular Ultrasound, a tomographic imaging method that can visualize 
      atherosclerotic plaques in vivo using radiofrequency analysis of ultrasound 
      backscatter signals. These ultrasound analyses showed an increase in the relative 
      volumes of both dense calcium and necrotic core with decreasing renal function. The 
      necrotic core/dense calcium ratio was significantly higher in patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction compared to those with stable angina pectoris. Furthermore, 
      the necrotic core/dense calcium ratio decreased in advanced CKD. Thus, the plaque 
      composition of coronary culprit lesions changed from necrotic core-rich to 
      extensively calcium-rich plaques as renal function decreased, suggesting that such 
      coronary culprit composition was associated with stability, particularly in advanced 
      CKD.

TI  - Coronary risk score for mineral bone disease in chronic non-diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients: results from a prospective pilot study.
PG  - 689-700
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1481-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder enhances coronary artery 
      impairment (often occult and difficult to diagnose) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. 
      The aim of the study was to correlate biochemical and imagistic parameters of MBD 
      with the degree of documented coronary artery disease (CAD) in non-diabetic HD 
      patients, in order to obtain a MBD-coronary risk score as a screening algorithm. 
      METHODS: A 3-year prospective study was conducted on 168 non-diabetic HD patients, 
      evaluating MBD biochemical parameters along with pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
      determination and valve/coronary calcification assessment; coronary angiography was 
      performed in symptomatic patients. Correlations between noninvasive parameters and 
      the degree of coronary obstruction were assessed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 
      software, Chi-square test and the determination of odds ratio. RESULTS: Significant 
      differences in serum calcium (p < 0.001), phosphates (p = 0.03), bicarbonate 
      (p < 0.001), albumin and iPTH (p = 0.002), percentage of deviations from PWV normal 
      values (p = 0.004), average doses of phosphate binders and vitamin D and the number 
      of vascular/valve calcifications were noted between the study group (angina, n = 17) 
      and control group (asymptomatic, n = 151). After applying MBD-coronary risk score in 
      control group, coronary angiography was performed in high-score patients. 
      CONCLUSION: A noninvasive screening algorithm for early diagnosis of CAD in 
      asymptomatic HD patients with altered MBD parameters is necessary. Applying 
      MBD-coronary risk score might be an important step in the prevention of major 
      coronary episodes by extending the indication for further investigations, early 
      diagnosis and treatment management.

TI  - Systemic Inflammation Is Associated With Coronary Artery Calcification and All-Cause 
      Mortality in Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1644-52
LID - 10.1253/circj.CJ-15-1224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of systemic inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      associated with advanced coronary artery calcification (CAC). The prognostic 
      significance of this association, however, is unknown. We evaluated the associations 
      between CAC, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and all-cause mortality, to 
      determine whether the associations differ according to the presence of systemic 
      inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 30,703 consecutive individuals who 
      underwent CAC measurement for a median of 79 months (IQR, 65-96 months). Patients 
      were categorized according to baseline CAC score (0, 1-99, 100-399 and ≥400), eGFR 
      (<45, 45-59, 60-74, 75-89, 90-104, and ≥105 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) and high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP; <2.0, and ≥2.0 mg/L). Prevalence and extent of CAC were 
      greater in those with lower eGFR and higher hsCRP accordingly, even after 
      adjustment. Lower eGFR was strongly associated with higher CAC score (≥400), and the 
      association was more significant in patients with higher hsCRP. The greater CAC 
      burden was associated with worse outcome in the CKD patients (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 
      m(2)) only in those with higher hsCRP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low eGFR and more 
      extensive CAC had greater risk of mortality, and associations differed according to 
      the presence of systemic inflammation. Among the CKD patients, coronary evaluation 
      may be considered for those with elevated hsCRP. (Circ J 2016; 80: 1644-1652).

TI  - Soluble TWEAK level: is it a marker for cardiovascular disease in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients?
PG  - 136-43
LID - 10.5301/jn.5000121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduced soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis 
      (sTWEAK) levels follow declining renal function, are strongly associated with 
      endothelial dysfunction and predict cardiovascular events in nondialyzed chronic 
      kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor 
      survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent evidence suggests a role for sTWEAK 
      in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. The aim of the study was to 
      investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and 
      vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial stiffness by pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by carotid 
      Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long-term prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK 
      levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Mean 
      serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 ± 147.5 pg/mL (range 78-937). sTWEAK level was 
      inversely correlated with CA-IMT at a borderline significance (r=-0.168, p=0.05). 
      Neither carotid-radial PWV nor carotid-femoral PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. 
      sTWEAK level was higher in patients with severe vascular calcification (CACs ≥400) 
      compared to patients with CACs <400 (264.5 ± 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 ± 122.4 pg/mL, 
      p=0.02).The association between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after 
      multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a weak inverse correlation 
      between sTWEAK and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary 
      artery calcification in long-term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for 
      sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.

TI  - C-reactive protein levels are associated with arterial media calcification in 
      nondiabetic patients with end-stage renal disease on long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 425-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VC) are associated with cardiovascular (CV) 
      morbidity and are independent predictors of CV mortality in end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD). This study aimed to investigate the presence of arterial intima 
      calcification (AIC) and arterial media calcification (AMC) in nondiabetic patients 
      on long-term hemodialysis, and to assess the association with CV risk factors. 
      METHODS: 34 ESRD patients (17 males) on hemodialysis for at least 5 years were 
      evaluated for VC using B-mode ultrasonography. RESULTS: AMC and AIC patterns were 
      detected respectively in 62% and 59% of patients, and 21% had no VC. Patients with 
      AIC were significantly older than those without AIC (p < 0.001). CRP levels (p < 
      0.001) were higher in patients with AMC. Using multivariate logistic analysis of 
      regression, older age (> 50 years) and higher CRP levels (> 5 mg/l) were associated 
      with AIC and AMC, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003). Logistic regression 
      analysis showed that patients with CRP > 5 mg/l had a greater relative risk of 
      having AMC (odds ratio 30, 95% confidence interval 27.041 - 32.959; p = 0.003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonography can be used to detect AIC and AMC, and could be useful 
      for the early detection of VC. In nondiabetic patients who had been on hemodialysis 
      for at least 5 years, older age was associated with AIC, and elevated CRP levels 
      with AMC.

TI  - Severe asymptomatic coronary obstruction in chronic hemodialysed patient - a case 
      report.
PG  - 424-428
AB  - Introduction. Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent 
      predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on renal 
      replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class. Case report. We 
      report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known with CKD stage 5D 
      on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral disease, admitted for 
      progressive right leg pain. The physical examination detected right dorsalis pedis 
      artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry emphasized hypercalcemia, 
      hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, metabolic acidosis, 
      hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray of right shin highlighted 
      a vascular calcification with a "train track" aspect on the tibial-peroneal artery 
      trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low ray regime) showed calcium deposits 
      in coronary arteries walls. Legs arteriography and coronary angiography were 
      performed revealing multiple lesions on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing 
      of right coronary artery. The particularity of the case lies in the absence of 
      angina in a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant 
      angiographically stenosis of the coronary arteries were found and successful 
      endovascular therapy was performed. Conclusion. The broadening of the indication for 
      coronary angiography should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D 
      patients based on a risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base 
      imbalances, while considering their major influence on the structure and tone of 
      vascular walls thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Abbreviations.

AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called 
      novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to 
      identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by 
      MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, 
      presence of ≥100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate, geriatric 
      nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3, cinacalcet, phosphate 
      binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation parameters including creatinine, 
      albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 MHD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcifications were observed in 192 patients (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS 
      showed direct associations with age (p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and 
      presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), and an inverse association only with 
      active vitamin D3 administration (p < 0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active 
      vitamin D3 showed significantly lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 ± 1635.0 
      vs. 2475.6 ± 2646.6 H, p < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and 
      diabetes mellitus are risk factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is 
      protective factor for coronary artery calcification in MHD patients.

TI  - Increased visceral adiposity is associated with coronary artery calcification in 
      male patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 610-4
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2013.66 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Recent epidemiological data have shown that abdominal fat 
      accumulation is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the association 
      between visceral adiposity and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. 
      SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 65 nondialyzed CKD male patients (59 ± 
      9 years, CKD stages 3 and 4). Abdominal fat compartments were assessed by computed 
      tomography (CT) at L4-L5 level. Visceral to subcutaneous (V/S) fat ratio was 
      calculated. Visceral obesity was defined as a V/S fat ratio greater than the median 
      value of the sample study (>0.55). CAC was detected by multi-slice CT. CAC scores 
      were calculated with the Agatston method. RESULTS: CAC was present (calcium score 
      >10 AU) in 66% of patients. In the group with visceral obesity, the CAC score was 
      significantly higher. This group had lower adiponectin and higher leptin levels 
      compared to patients without visceral obesity. In the whole sample, higher V/S fat 
      ratio was associated with CAC score, independently of age, body mass index, 
      diabetes, ionized calcium, smoking or renal function. CONCLUSION: Our results show 
      an association between visceral obesity and CAC in CKD patients, suggesting a 
      deleterious effect of visceral fat in these patients. Increased visceral adiposity 
      might enhance cardiovascular risk in this particular population.

TI  - Serum Sclerostin as an Independent Marker of Peripheral Arterial Stiffness in Renal 
      Transplantation Recipients: A Cross-Sectional Study.

AB  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is thought to be implicated in the development of 
      arterial stiffness and vascular calcification. As a Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor, 
      it is interesting to investigate whether sclerostin or dickkopf-1 (DKK1) level is 
      correlated with arterial stiffness in renal transplant (RT) recipients. Fasting 
      blood samples were obtained for biochemical data, sclerostin, DKK1, and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) determinations. In this study, we applied automatic pulse wave 
      analyzer (VaSera VS-1000) to measure brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and either 
      sides of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity value, which greater than 14.0 m/s was 
      determined as high arterial stiffness. Among 68 RT recipients, 30 patients (44.1%) 
      were in the high arterial stiffness group. Compared with patients in the low 
      arterial stiffness group, patients in the high arterial stiffness group had higher 
      prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.002), diabetes (P < 0.001), metabolic syndrome 
      (P = 0.025), longer posttransplant duration (P = 0.005), higher systolic blood 
      pressure (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.018), and higher fasting 
      glucose (P = 0.004), total cholesterol (P = 0.042), blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.020), 
      phosphorus (P = 0.042), and sclerostin levels (P = 0.001). According to our 
      multivariable forward stepwise linear regression analysis, age (β = 0.272, 
      P = 0.014), phosphorus (β = 0.308, P = 0.007), and logarithmically-transformed OPG 
      (log-OPG; β = 0.222, P = 0.046) were positively associated with sclerostin levels, 
      and multivariate logistic regression analysis, sclerostin (odds ratio 1.052, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.007-1.099, P = 0.024), and posttransplant duration (odds ratio 
      1.024, 95% confidence interval 1.004-1.045, P = 0.019) were the independent 
      predictors of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients. In this study, serum 
      sclerostin level, but not DKK1, was proved to be involved in the pathogenetic 
      process of peripheral arterial stiffness in RT recipients.

TI  - High Parathyroid Hormone Level and Osteoporosis Predict Progression of Coronary

AB  - Coronary artery calcifications (CACs) are observed in most patients with CKD on 
      dialysis (CKD-5D). CACs frequently progress and are associated with increased risk 
      for cardiovascular events, the major cause of death in these patients. A link 
      between bone and vascular calcification has been shown. This prospective study was 
      designed to identify noninvasive tests for predicting CAC progression, including 
      measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and novel bone markers in adult patients 
      with CKD-5D. At baseline and after 1 year, patients underwent routine blood tests 
      and measurement of CAC, BMD, and novel serum bone markers. A total of 213 patients 
      received baseline measurements, of whom about 80% had measurable CAC and almost 50% 
      had CAC Agatston scores>400, conferring high risk for cardiovascular events. 
      Independent positive predictors of baseline CAC included coronary artery disease, 
      diabetes, dialysis vintage, fibroblast growth factor-23 concentration, and age, 
      whereas BMD of the spine measured by quantitative computed tomography was an inverse 
      predictor. Hypertension, HDL level, and smoking were not baseline predictors in 
      these patients. Three quarters of 122 patients completing the study had CAC 
      increases at 1 year. Independent risk factors for CAC progression were age, baseline 
      total or whole parathyroid hormone level greater than nine times the normal value, 
      and osteoporosis by t scores. Our results confirm a role for bone in CKD-associated 
      CAC prevalence and progression.

TI  - Extracellular Fluid Excess Is Significantly Associated With Coronary Artery 
      Calcification in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.008935 [doi]
LID - e008935
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular fluid (ECF) excess is an independent predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity in patients undergoing dialysis. This study aimed to 
      investigate the relationship between ECF status, which is affected by renal 
      function, and coronary artery calcification (CAC), which is a marker of 
      cardiovascular disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: A total of 1741 patients at all stages of pre-dialysis CKD from the 
      prospective observational cohort of CMERC-HI (Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease 
      Etiology Research Center-High Risk) were analyzed for the association between ECF 
      status and CAC. ECF status was defined as extracellular water-to-total body water 
      ratio (ECW/TBW) measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. ECF excess was 
      defined as ECW/TBW ≥0.390 or ≥0.400 depending on its severity. To define CAC, 
      Agatston coronary artery calcium scores were measured. A total coronary artery 
      calcium score of ≥400 was defined as CAC. The CKD stages were defined according to 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the CKD Epidemiology 
      Collaboration equation. ECW/TBW and the proportion of ECF excess increased with 
      progressing CKD stages. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that 
      ECW/TBW was independently associated with CAC (per 0.01 increase of ECW/TBW, odds 
      ratio 1.168, 95% confidence interval, 1.079-1.264, P<0.001). The adjusted R(2) for 
      predicting higher coronary artery calcium scores and CAC significantly improved 
      after ECW/TBW was added to conventional factors. This association was further 
      confirmed by net reclassification and integrated discriminant improvements, 
      sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis. CONCLUSIONS: ECF status is 
      independently associated with a high risk of CAC in patients with CKD. STUDY

TI  - Does cinacalcet HCl, an oral calcimimetic agent for the treatment of secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism, improve arterial stiffness in patients on continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis?
PG  - 134-9
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to 
      cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, VC and AS are correlated. 
      Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to the progression of VC 
      and to increases in AS. The efficacy of cinacalcet (CIN) in reducing AS in patients 
      on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has not been determined. The 
      present study enrolled 19 CAPD patients (12 women, 7 men; mean age: 62.2 +/- 3.6 
      years) with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater than 500 ng/dL (mean 
      value: 675 +/- 106 ng/dL) in whom daily oral treatment with CIN 25 mg was started. 
      If administration of CIN for 3 months failed to reduce the level of iPTH to less 
      than 300 ng/dL, the dose of CIN was increased to 50 mg daily. Before the start of 
      CIN and at 3 years after the start of CIN, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined. 
      In 11 patients, levels of iPTH were reduced to less than 300 ng/dL; levels in the 
      rest of the patients remained high. We observed no significant differences in PWV 
      before CIN and at 3 years after CIN start (1856 +/- 198 cm/s vs. 1726 +/- 187 cm/s). 
      Multivariate regression analysis of PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood 
      pressure and changes in serum levels of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV In 
      patients receiving CAPD, VC and AS might be the result of higher systolic blood 
      pressure and increased serum levels of phosphate.

TI  - The association between coronary artery calcification progression and loss of bone 
      density in non-dialyzed CKD patients.
PG  - 425-31

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) and low bone density are coexisting 
      deleterious conditions commonly shared by chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In 
      the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the progression of CAC was 
      associated with overtime reduction in bone density in non-dialyzed CKD patients. 
      METHODS: This is a prospective study of 24 months including 72 non-dialyzed CKD 
      patients Stages 2 - 4 (age 57.6 ± 10.3 years, 62% male, 22% diabetics). CAC and 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) were measured by computed tomography. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 46% of the patients had CAC (calcified group) and calcification was not 
      identified in 54% of the patients (non-calcified group). The calcified group was 
      older, predominantly male, and had lower VBD in comparison to non-calcified group. 
      CAC progression was observed only in the calcified group (91% of the patients 
      increased calcium score). The multiple regression analysis revealed loss of VBD as 
      the independent determinant of CAC progression in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: CAC 
      progression was associated with loss of VBD in non-dialyzed CKD patients.

TI  - Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria predict mortality independently from 
      coronary artery calcified plaque in the Diabetes Heart Study.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-12-68 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains an 
      important priority in the management of associated morbidity and mortality, 
      including from cardiovascular disease (CVD). The current investigation examined 
      whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin:creatinine 
      ratio (UACR) were independent predictors of CVD-mortality in European Americans 
      (EAs) with T2D after accounting for subclinical CVD. METHODS: The family-based 
      Diabetes Heart Study (DHS) cohort (n=1,220) had baseline measures of serum 
      creatinine, eGFR, UACR and coronary artery calcified plaque (CAC) assessed by 
      non-contrast computed tomography scan. Cox proportional hazards regression was 
      performed to determine risk for all-cause mortality and CVD-mortality associated 
      with indices of kidney disease after accounting for traditional CVD risk factors and 
      CAC as a measure of subclinical CVD. RESULTS: Participants were followed for 8.2±2.6 
      years (mean±SD) during which time 247 (20.9%) were deceased, 107 (9.1%) from CVD. 
      Univariate analyses revealed positive associations between serum creatinine 
      (HR:1.56; 95% CI:1.37-1.80; p<0.0001) and UACR (1.59; 1.43-1.77; p>0.0001) and 
      negative associations between serum albumin (0.74; 0.65-0.84; p<0.0001) and eGFR 
      (0.66; 0.58-0.76; p<0.0001) with all-cause mortality. Associations remained 
      significant after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, as well as for CAC. 
      Similar trends were noted when predicting risk for CVD-mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      DHS reveals that kidney function and albuminuria are independent risk factors for 
      all-cause mortality and CVD-mortality in EAs with T2D, even after accounting for 
      CAC.

      patients with acute chest pain without known coronary artery disease: up to 5-year

PG  - 1619-26

AB  - Long-term incremental prognostic value of renal function over coronary artery 
      calcium score (CACS) in symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine additive prognostic 
      value of renal function over CACS in patients with acute chest pain suspected of 
      CAD. Renal function and CACS were assessed in patients without known CAD who 
      presented to the emergency department with chest pain from 2005 to 2008. Renal 
      function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). A total of 949 
      patients (804 non-CKD and 145 CKD, age 54 ± 13 years) were included. During the 
      follow-up period of up to 5.3 years, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) occurred in 
      5.7% of patients (19 cardiac deaths, 6 myocardial infarction and 29 late coronary 
      revascularization). Annualized MACE rate was higher in patients in higher CACS 
      categories with and without CKD (p = 0.011 and p < 0.001 respectively). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis, CACS categories (CACS 1-100: HR 3.17, p = 
      0.005; CACS 101-400: HR 7.68, p < 0.001; CACS > 400: HR 8.88, p < 0.001) and CKD (HR 
      10.18, p < 0.001) were independent predictors for MACE. Both adding renal function 
      and CACS significantly improved the overall predictive performance (p < 0.001 for 
      global Chi square increase) from Framingham risk categories or thrombolysis in 
      myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score. Both CACS and renal function were 
      independent predictors for future cardiac events and provided additive prognostic 
      value to each other and over either Framingham risk categories or TIMI risk score.

AB  - The negative relation of serum adiponectin to atherosclerosis becomes a positive 
      association in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a 
      small-scale cross-sectional observational study, in 101 Japanese male hemodialysis 
      patients, to examine the relationship of serum adiponectin and leptin to abdominal 
      aortic calcification (AAC). The presence of AAC was evaluated from simple X-ray 
      radiographs of the left lateral abdomen. Serum adiponectin was significantly higher 
      in AAC-positive patients [18.8 (13.0-28.1) μg/mL] than in AAC-negative patients 
      [15.4 (8.9-22.8) μg/mL] (p = 0.03), whereas serum leptin did not differ 
      significantly between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed 
      that log adiponectin, but not log leptin, was independently and significantly 
      associated in a positive manner with AAC (odds ratio: 16.31, 95% confidence 
      interval: 1.70-156.41, p = 0.02), after adjustment for age, body weight, percentage 
      body fat, hemodialysis duration, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and other risk 
      factors. In conclusion, we found a positive and independent association of serum 
      adiponectin with AAC in male hemodialysis patients, indicating that the reversed 
      association between serum adiponectin and atherosclerosis in patients with CKD dose 
      not result from increased serum adiponectin due to the impaired urinary secretion.

TI  - Role of sodium thiosulfate therapy in the treatment of digital necrosis due to 
      Mönckeberg sclerosis.

AB  - Accelerated vascular calcification is a well-described complication of chronic 
      kidney disease often affecting large and small vessels alike through a variety of 
      mechanisms. Accordingly, dysregulation of calcium and phosphate balance, vitamin D 
      metabolism, hyperparathyroidism, and endothelial injury can lead to both 
      macrovascular and microvascular complications. We describe a 56-year-old Hispanic 
      male with a history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and 
      medical noncompliance who developed sequential digital ischemia and necrosis 
      involving both hands as well as right foot as a result of Mönckeberg sclerosis. An 
      extensive metabolic and serologic workup was unrevealing but radiographic studies 
      and histopathology revealed the diagnosis. A multifaceted approach was instituted 
      including wound debridement and amputations along with intensive medical support. In 
      addition to improving hypertensive control and striving for improved calcium and 
      phosphate balance, sodium thiosulfate solution was administered for more than 1 
      year. This aggressive approach allowed his wounds to heal and has arrested further 
      digital ischemia from occurring.

TI  - Serum sclerostin values are associated with abdominal aortic calcification and 
      predict cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5D.
PG  - 286-292
LID - 10.1111/nep.12813 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible association of 
      circulating concentrations of sclerostin with abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3-5. 
      METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with CKD3-5D were enrolled. The patients 
      were divided into two groups according to the presence of AAC: an AAC group (n = 99) 
      and a non-AAC group (n = 62). The concentration of serum sclerostin was measured 
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AAC was evaluated using 
      abdominal lateral X-ray examination. The follow-up intervals ranged from 7 to 
      29 months (median 16 months), and cardiovascular events (CVEs) were recorded. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) was 61.5% (99/161). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly higher in an AAC group than in a non-AAC group 
      (P < 0.001), but the concentration in the moderate-to-severe AAC group was lower 
      than in the mild AAC group (P < 0.001). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed 
      that high serum sclerostin, high serum calcium, diabetes, and old age were 
      independently correlated with AAC. Patients with higher sclerostin values had a 
      reduced risk of major cardiovascular events (log-rank test, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Serum sclerostin values are associated with the presence of AAC, but are lower when 
      AAC is moderate to severe. Higher values are predictive of reduced short-term 
      cardiovascular events. Taken together, these results suggest that sclerostin may 
      have a role in the development of or the response to vascular calcification.

TI  - Normal body mass index with central obesity has increased risk of coronary artery 
      calcification in Korean patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), overweight and mild obesity have shown the lowest 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, central obesity has been directly associated with 
      CV risk in these patients. This bidirectional relationship of body mass index (BMI) 
      and central obesity prompted us to evaluate CV risk based on a combination of BMI 
      and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in nondialysis CKD patients. We included 1078 patients 
      with CKD stage 2 through 5 (nondialysis) enrolled in a nationwide prospective cohort 
      of Korea. Patients were divided into 3 groups by BMI (normal BMI, 18.5-22.9; 
      overweight, 23.0-27.4; and obese, 27.5 and over kg/m(2)) and were dichotomized by a 
      sex-specific median WHR (0.92 in males and 0.88 in females). Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) was determined by multislice computed tomography. CAC (score 
      above 10 Agatston units) was found in 477 patients. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that BMI was not independently associated with CAC. However, WHR 
      showed an independent linear and significant association with CAC (odds ratio, 
      1.036; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.065 per 0.01 increase). Furthermore, when 
      patients were categorized into 6 groups according to a combination of BMI and WHR, 
      normal BMI but higher WHR had the highest risk of CAC compared with the normal BMI 
      with lower WHR group (2.104; 1.074-4.121). Thus, a normal BMI with central obesity 
      was associated with the highest risk of CAC, suggesting that considering BMI and 
      WHR, 2 surrogates of obesity, can help to discriminate CV risk in Korean nondialysis 
      CKD patients.

TI  - Induction of intracellular heat-shock protein 72 prevents the development of 
      vascular smooth muscle cell calcification.
PG  - 524-32
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvs278 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant contributor to cardiovascular 
      mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and coronary artery disease 
      (CAD). Osteo/chondrocytic transformation and simultaneous dedifferentiation of 
      smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in the pathogenesis of VC. Heat-shock 
      protein 72 (HSP72) is a cardioprotective inducible heat-shock protein that functions 
      as a molecular chaperone. However, its role in the development of accelerated 
      vascular dysfunction and calcification is largely unexplored. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      We describe for the first time marked reduction in HSP72 expression in arteries from 
      patients with CKD and CAD, compared with healthy controls, in vivo. Induction of 
      HSP72 by heat-shock treatment (HST) significantly prevented the development of 
      calcification of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HA-SMCs), in vitro. These 
      anti-calcific effects were abolished following treatment with both quercetin, an HST 
      inhibitor, and HSP72 siRNA knockdown. Induction of HSP72 suppressed Cbfa-1-dependent 
      osteo/chondrocytic transformation and stabilized SMC contractile phenotype through 
      the myocardin-serum response factor (SRF) pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation studies 
      demonstrated physical association between SRF and HSP72. Furthermore, organ culture 
      of arteries from CKD and CAD patients showed that these arteries retained their 
      ability to induce HSP72 following HST, despite initially reduced expression. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study shows for the first time that intracellular HSP72 may function 
      as a central regulator of molecular pathways involved in the development of VC. We 
      suggest treatment strategies that up-regulate HSP72 as a new approach to inhibit VC.

      (SPK) transplantation could beneficially affect progression of coronary artery 
      disease (CAD) when compared with transplantation of a kidney-alone from a living 
      donor (LDK). METHODS: In 42 kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts who 
      had received either SPK (n = 25) or LDK (n = 17), we studied angiographic 
      progression of CAD between baseline (pretransplant) and follow-up at 7 years or 
      older. In addition, computed tomography scans for measures of coronary artery 
      calcification and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function 
      were addressed at follow-up. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 10.1 years 
      (interquartile range [IQR], 9.1-11.5) progression of CAD occurred at similar rates 
      (10 of 21 cases in the SPK and 5 of 14 cases in the LDK group; P = 0.49). Median 
      coronary artery calcification scores were high in both groups (1767 [IQR, 321-4035] 
      for SPK and 1045 [IQR, 807-2643] for LDK patients; P = 0.59). Left ventricular 
      systolic function did not differ between the 2 groups. The SPK and LDK recipients 
      were similar in age (41.2 ± 6.9 years vs 40.5 ± 10.3 years; P = 0.80) and diabetes 
      duration at engraftment but with significant different mean HbA1c levels of 5.5 ± 
      0.4% for SPK and 8.3 ± 1.5% for LDK patients (P < 0.001) during follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with both type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, SPK 
      recipients had similar progression of CAD long-term compared with LDK recipients. 
      Calcification of coronary arteries is a prominent feature in both groups long-term 
      posttransplant.

TI  - Arteriovenous grafts: early ultrasonography tells their fortune.
PG  - 420-5
LID - 10.1159/000433607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patency of arteriovenous grafts (AVG) for hemodialysis is mostly 
      limited by growing stenoses that lead to decreasing of blood flow, thromboses and 
      finally to access failure. The aim of this study was to find out if detection of any 
      pathology by duplex Doppler ultrasonography (DDU) early after creation of AVG could 
      identify those with lower survival. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled AVG 
      examined by DDU in our center within 40 days after their creation during the last 10 
      years. The findings were divided into 4 subgroups: (1a) normal finding, (1b) DDU 
      risk factor (low flow volume, medial calcinosis of the feeding artery, presence of 
      intimal hyperplasia in the venous anastomosis), (2a) non-significant or (2b) 
      significant stenosis. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative survival of 
      people with AVGs, and the secondary was the primary (unassisted) survival. All 
      patients underwent DDU surveillance every 3 months with pre-emptive treatment of 
      significant stenoses. RESULTS: Overall, 340 cases were found; the median follow-up 
      was 565 days. Normal DDU finding had 60% cases, DDU risk factor 18% cases, 
      non-significant stenosis 13% cases and significant stenosis 9% cases. Occurrence of 
      early significant stenosis was associated with high risk of access loss (hazards 
      ratio (HR) 14.73; 95% CI 5.10-42.58; p < 0.0001). Similarly, the presence of a DDU 
      risk factor and of a non-significant stenosis were related to significantly shorter 
      access lifespan (HR 2.86; 95% CI 1.10-7.40; p = 0.03 and HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.12-7.17; 
      p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: DDU examination of AVG early after their 
      creation can identify those at higher risk and may contribute to individualize the 
      surveillance strategy.

TI  - Nonthyroidal illness: a risk factor for coronary calcification and arterial 
      stiffness in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis?
PG  - 584-93
LID - 10.1111/joim.12107 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low triiodothyronine levels, as part of the nonthyroidal illness 
      syndrome, are common in dialysis patients and have repeatedly been shown to be 
      associated with increased (cardiovascular) mortality rates. We hypothesized that 
      increased vascular calcification may mediate this relationship. METHODS: A total of 
      84 patients from the Stockholm region receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis were 
      included in the study. Serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (fT3), 
      thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured. Coronary artery calcium 
      (CAC) scores were assessed by cardiac computed tomography scans. Surrogates of 
      arterial stiffness included aortic diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse 
      pressure, augmentation pressure and Buckberg's subendocardial viability ratio 
      measured by pulse waveform analyses. Patients were subsequently followed, and events 
      of death and censoring were recorded. Thyroid hormone concentrations were associated 
      with CAC scores, measures of arterial stiffness and all-cause mortality. The 
      associations between CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates and mortality were 
      also determined to evaluate a possible causal pathway. RESULTS: Both CAC scores and 
      arterial stiffness surrogates were substantially higher in individuals with low fT3 
      levels. These associations persisted in multivariate logistic and linear regression 
      analyses. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 32 (22-42) months, 24 
      patients died. Both fT3 levels below the median value [HR crude 4.1, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 1.4-12.6] and CAC scores above the median value (HR crude 5.8, 95% CI 
      1.7-20.1) were strongly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis, fT3 levels were strongly associated with arterial 
      stiffness, coronary artery calcification and mortality. We speculate that the 
      association between nonthyroidal illness and mortality may be partly mediated by 
      acceleration of vascular calcification.

TI  - Correlation of pre-existing radial artery macrocalcifications with late patency of 
      primary radiocephalic fistulas in diabetic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 462-70
LID - S0741-5214(14)00309-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing radial 
      artery macrocalcification (Mönckeberg type of arteriosclerosis) on patency rates of 
      radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs) in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this observational prospective study, the 
      long-term patency rates (primary outcome measures) of RCFs in ESRD diabetics who had 
      Mönckeberg radial (±brachial) artery disease (calcified [C] group) were compared 
      with those obtained in ESRD diabetics who had healthy, noncalcified vessels before 
      RCF construction (healthy [H] group). Vessel calcification was assessed by plain 
      two-dimensional radiography. For inclusion in the C-group, uniform linear railroad 
      track-type macrocalcifications of at least 6 cm in length, in the medial wall of the 
      radial artery ipsilateral to RCF creation, were required. Patients were included in 
      the H-group if the radial artery ipsilateral to the RCF creation was free of any 
      macrocalcification, of either intima or media type. Any intimal-like plaque with 
      irregular and patchy distribution was an exclusion criterion for both groups. 
      Patients in both groups also were required to have suitable upper limb vascular 
      anatomy on the basis of ultrasound imaging before RCF creation (cephalic vein of 
      minimum diameter of 1.6 mm, without stenosis or thrombosis in all outflow areas, and 
      radial artery of minimum diameter of 1.5 mm, without proximal hemodynamically 
      significant stenosis). Secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality. 
      Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparison between groups. RESULTS: The arm 
      radiograph at the site of possible fistula construction showed abnormality in 39 
      patients (C-group, 47 RCFs), whereas 33 patients had noncalcified ("healthy") 
      vascular anatomy (H-group, 40 RCFs). Mean duration of the diabetic disease at the 
      time of RCF creation was 8.9 ± 5.6 years (range, 2-25 years) for the H-group and 14 
      ± 9.9 years (range, 1-40 years) for the C-group (P = .018). The mean follow-up 
      period for H-group and C-group was 51.9 ± 35.9 months (range, 0.1-126 months) and 
      26.1 ± 31.6 months (range, 0.1-144 months), respectively (P = .0006). Forty-four 
      patients died during the follow-up period. Primary patency rates at 12, 24, 36, and 
      48 months for C-group vs H-group were 50.2% vs 80%, 36.5% vs 72.3%, 32.4% vs 67.9%, 
      and 29.1% vs 59.3% (P = .0019). Respective values for secondary patency rates were 
      52.4% vs 87.5%, 40.9% vs 82.4%, 36.6% vs 78.1%, and 33.2% vs 72.8% (P = .00064). 
      Patient survival rates at 24 and 48 months were 56.1% and 46.4% for C-group and 
      92.4% and 67.4% for H-group, respectively (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: ESRD diabetics 
      with radial artery Mönckeberg calcifications receiving RCFs had worse late clinical 
      outcomes compared with ESRD diabetics with healthy distal arm vessels receiving the 
      same access. The long-term benefit of RCFs may be lost in diabetics with extensively 
      calcified vessels, and preferably the brachial artery should be used instead.

TI  - Endogenous soluble receptor of advanced glycation end-products (esRAGE) is 
      negatively associated with vascular calcification in non-diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1193-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0007-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulate in CKD and may 
      predispose to cardiovascular disease by inducing inflammatory and oxidant stress in 
      the vascular endothelium. Soluble forms of the receptor for AGE (RAGE) may be 
      protective against these effects by binding AGE in the soluble phase. Accumulating 
      evidence suggests a protective role of soluble RAGE against vascular calcification. 
      This study investigates the association between endogenous soluble RAGE (esRAGE) and 
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We studied 65 non-diabetic 
      hemodialysis patients, on 3 × 4 h dialysis schedule, and 19 controls. Serum levels 
      of esRAGE, hsCRP, parathormone, lipids, calcium, and phosphorus were measured. 
      Aortic calcification index (ACI) was measured using non-contrast CT of the abdominal 
      aorta. RESULTS: Aortic calcification was detected in 64 out of 65 hemodialysis 
      patients. Levels of esRAGE were lower in hemodialysis patients (278 pg/ml, SD 101.1) 
      than in controls (443 ± 109 pg/ml; P = 0.001). ACI correlated negatively in stepwise 
      multivariate analysis with esRAGE (P = 0.002) and positively with hsCRP (<0.0001), 
      systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001) and dialysis vintage (P = 0.05); R (2) = 0.65. 
      CONCLUSION: Levels of esRAGE were low among hemodialysis patients and correlated 
      negatively with ACI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of drugs that is extensively 
      used for common gastrointestinal disorders and often prescribed long-term for years. 
      Long-term PPI treatment is associated with an increased risk of fractures in the 
      general population. Several studies have suggested a relationship between vascular 
      calcification, which is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, 
      impaired bone metabolism and fractures. In dialysis patients, vascular 
      calcifications are widespread and are connected to bone health. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of this study was to assess the association between the use of PPIs and vascular 
      calcifications involving the aorta and iliac arteries in haemodialysis patients. 
      METHODS: Between November 2008 and November 2009, 387 patients receiving long-term 
      dialysis treatment (≥1 year) were enrolled in a multicentre (18 Dialysis Units), 
      cross-sectional study. Overall, 76.2 % of patients were receiving long-term PPI 
      treatment. The main outcome measure was calcification of the aorta and iliac 
      arteries in relation to PPI use. Standardized radiographs were sent to the 
      coordinating centre for centralized evaluation in duplicate by two physicians who 
      were blind to PPI status. RESULTS: Arterial calcifications were significantly more 
      common in the PPI group (p < 0.01). Also, the rates of aortic and iliac 
      calcifications considered separately were higher (+12.2 %, p = 0.0254; and +13.6 %, 
      p = 0.0211, respectively). After correction for the propensity score, the odds 
      ratios [ORs] (95 % CI) related to PPI use were aorta 1.89 (1.01-3.54), p = 0.048; 
      iliac arteries 2.27 (1.31-3.92), p = 0.003; aorta and iliac arteries 2.59 
      (1.48-4.53), p = 0.008. The ORs (95 % CI) related to the association of warfarin + 
      PPI were aorta 2.19 (0.95-5.00), p = 0.06; iliac arteries 2.90 (1.07-7.86), p = 
      0.036; aorta and iliac arteries 2.69 (1.03-6.96), p = 0.042. CONCLUSION: In 
      haemodialysis patients, long-term treatment with PPIs, especially in the presence of 
      warfarin treatment, is associated with vascular calcifications.

AB  - Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause 
      mortality in end-stage renal disease population. AoAC can be simply estimated with 
      an AoAC score using plain chest radiography. The objective of this study is to 
      evaluate the association of AoAC with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and 
      cardiomegaly in patients who have undergoing hemodialysis (HD).We retrospectively 
      determined AoAC and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) by chest x-ray in 220 HD patients who 
      underwent the measurement of baPWV. The values of baPWV were measured by an 
      ankle-brachial index-form device. Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis was 
      used to identify the factors associated with AoAC score >4.Compared patients with 
      AoAC score ≦4, patients with AoAC score >4 had older age, higher prevalence of 
      diabetes and cerebrovascular disease, lower diastolic blood pressure, higher baPWV, 
      higher CTR, higher prevalence of CTR ≧50%, lower total cholesterol, and lower 
      creatinine level. After the multivariate stepwise logistic analysis, old age, 
      cerebrovascular disease, high baPWV (per 100 cm/s, odds ratio [OR] 1.065, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.003-1.129, P = 0.038), CTR (per 1%, OR 1.116, 95% CI 
      1.046-1.191, P = 0.001), and low total cholesterol level were independently 
      associated with AoAC score >4.Our study demonstrated AoAC severity was associated 
      with high baPWV and high CTR in patients with HD. Therefore, we suggest that 
      evaluating AoAC on plain chest radiography may be a simple and inexpensive method 
      for detecting arterial stiffness in HD patients.

TI  - Long-term clinical outcome of rotational atherectomy followed by drug-eluting stent 
      implantation in complex calcified coronary lesions.
PG  - 285-91
LID - 10.1002/ccd.24367 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term outcome after rotational atherectomy (RA) is 
      followed by drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in complex calcified coronary 
      lesions. BACKGROUND: RA can favorably modify heavily calcified coronary lesions, but 
      long-term outcome is poor when it is used as a stand-alone therapy or combined with 
      bare-metal stents. DES have reduced rates of restenosis in a wide range of patient 
      and lesion subsets, but little information is available on long-term clinical 
      outcome when RA is followed by DES implantation (Rota-DES) in complex calcified 
      lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients with de novo complex 
      calcified coronary lesions treated with Rota-DES were analyzed. Mean age was 69.7 ± 
      9.3 years, 63 patients (31%) had diabetes mellitus and 21 patients (10%) had chronic 
      renal failure. Total stent length/patient was 32 mm. The majority of patients were 
      treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents (64%) or sirolimus-eluting stents (30%). 
      Angiographic success rate was 98%. The incidence of in-hospital major adverse 
      cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target 
      vessel revascularization (TVR), was 4.4%. Long-term follow-up was available for 188 
      patients (92%). At a median follow-up period of 15 months (range, 1-84), the 
      cumulative incidence of MACE (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 17.7%. Death occurred in 
      4.4%, MI in 3.4%, TVR in 9.9%, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) in 6.8%. 
      One definite (0.5%) and one probable (0.5%) stent thrombosis were observed. In a 
      multivariate analysis, low ejection fraction (<40%) was the only independent 
      predictor of MACE, and both age and diabetes were independent predictors of TLR. 
      CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest European data set of patients treated 
      with RA in the DES era. RA followed by DES implantation in calcified coronary 
      lesions appears to be feasible and effective, with a high rate of procedural success 
      and low incidence of TLR and MACE at long term considering this complex patient and 
      lesion subset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between the dialysate calcium level and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) has not yet been evaluated in hemodialysis patients. The 
      objective of this study was to determine whether lowering the dialysate calcium 
      levels would decrease the progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      compared to using standard calcium dialysate. METHODS: We conducted an open-label 
      randomized trial with parallel groups. The patients were randomly assigned to either 
      12-month treatment with low calcium dialysate (LCD; 1.25mmol/L, n=36) or standard 
      calcium dialysate (SCD; 1.5mmol/L, n=40). The primary outcome was the change in the 
      CAC scores assessed by 64-slice multidetector computed tomography after 12months. 
      RESULTS: During the treatment period, CAC scores increased in both groups, 
      especially significant in LCD group (402.5±776.8, 580.5±1011.9, P=0.004). When we 
      defined progressors as patients at second and third tertiles of CAC changes, 
      progressor group had a higher proportion of LCD-treated patients than SCD-treated 
      patients (P=0.0229). In multivariate analysis, LCD treatment is a significant risk 
      factor for increase in CAC scores (odds ratio=5.720, 95% CI: 1.219-26.843, P=0.027). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of LCD may accelerate the progression of CAC in patients with 
      chronic hemodialysis over a 12-month period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Research

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular disease and major extremity amputation are common in 
      patients with established renal failure and are associated with considerable 
      morbidity. Several studies have shown high rates of amputation following 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, but there is minimal literature on the 
      incidence of amputation following renal transplantation. Furthermore, there is 
      little evidence regarding the best method of predicting which patients might be at 
      risk of developing peripheral vascular complications after transplantation. METHODS: 
      We undertook a 5 year follow-up on the cohort of patients who were on our renal 
      transplant waiting list 5 years ago (January 2007). At this time, it was standard 
      practice within our unit for all patients to have routine pelvic x-rays to assess 
      for vascular calcification of the iliac vessels at the time of activation onto the 
      transplant waiting list. Any patients with moderate/severe calcification on x-ray, 
      which may complicate transplantation, were referred for computed tomography 
      angiogram (CTA) of their aorto-iliac vessels. Mortality, transplantation outcomes, 
      and amputation rates at 5 years were correlated with the severity of calcification 
      on preoperative imaging. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven patients were on the 
      waiting list for renal transplantation in January 2007 (92 men; mean age, 58.3 +/- 
      6.2 years). Ninety-three patients received a transplant during the subsequent 5 
      years. By January 2012, 82 patients had a functioning transplant, 45 remained on the 
      waiting list (5 suspended), 40 patients had died, and 20 were alive but no longer on 
      the waiting list. Seventy-three (39.5%) had moderate or severe calcification on 
      plain x-ray and went on to have CTA. Of these patients, 16 (21.9%) had extensive 
      calcification affecting all the iliac vessels and were removed from the waiting list 
      as a result. Preoperative imaging was useful in determining the side for surgery in 
      a further 18 patients (24.3%). Twenty-two patients developed vascular complications. 
      Nineteen (86.4%) had moderate-severe vascular calcification on imaging. Four of the 
      patients with vascular complications (18.2%) underwent transplantation (2 had below 
      knee amputation (BKA) prior to transplantation; 1 developed distal ischemia on the 
      same side as the transplantation 2 years postoperatively; 1 had bilateral above knee 
      amputation (AKA) approximately 2 years after transplantation). Eleven (50%) of the 
      patients with vascular complications were dead at 5 years of follow-up. Mortality 
      and amputation rates were higher in patients with moderate-severe calcification than 
      minimal calcification (30.1% vs 16.6%; P = .02 and 10.9% vs 1.8%; P = .003, 
      respectively). There was no difference in rates of delayed graft function (DGF), 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), or creatinine at 1 year between patients who 
      underwent transplantation with moderate-severe calcification and those without, 
      however, intraoperative vascular complications (26.7% vs 3%; P < .001), graft loss 
      (28.1% vs 3.4%; P = .01), and death with a functioning transplant (9.7% vs 1.6%; P = 
      .04) rates were higher in patients with extensive calcification compared with those 
      without. CONCLUSIONS: Plain x-ray of the pelvis is a useful screening tool to 
      identify those patients who may require further detailed vascular imaging prior to 
      transplantation. Amputation rates following renal transplantation are low and 
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in isolation should not preclude transplantation. 
      Nevertheless, significant vascular calcification is predictive of mortality both 
      with and without transplantation and graft loss in patients with a renal transplant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of preexisting microcalcification in the iliac 
      artery is undetermined in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We obtained iliac 
      artery segments from 90 transplant recipients at the time of renal transplantation 
      and performed von Kossa staining for microcalcification. The clinical significance 
      of intimal microcalcification was evaluated with allograft survival rate, rate of 
      graft function decline, and composite of any cardiovascular event or patient death. 
      Expression of fetuin-A and C-reactive protein, key regulators of calcification, was 
      also investigated in the iliac artery. RESULTS: Intimal microcalcification was 
      positive in 48 (53.3%) patients, and its intensity was correlated positively with 
      intimal C-reactive protein intensity (P = 0.019). Allograft survival in patients 
      positive for intimal microcalcification was lower than patients who were negative (P 
      = 0.017). The patients with positivity for both intimal microcalcification and 
      fetuin-A showed lower allograft survival rate than patients with intimal 
      microcalcification positivity alone (P = 0.012). The rate of renal graft function 
      decline was significantly steeper in patients positive for intimal 
      microcalcification than in patients who were negative (P = 0.036). In multivariate 
      analysis, positivity for both intimal microcalcification and fetuin-A was an 
      independent predictor for renal graft function decline (β = -10.21; P = 0.011). The 
      intimal microcalcification was not associated with composite-event free survival. 
      CONCLUSION: Preexisting intimal microcalcification in the iliac artery predicts a 
      lower allograft survival rate and rapid decline of allograft function. Positivity of 
      fetuin-A with intimal microcalcification further reduces allograft survival rate and 
      an independent predictor for renal graft function decline.

TI  - Monckeberg's calciphylaxis with necrosis of the glans penis: a case presentation.
PG  - 300-2
AB  - Monckeberg's calcific sclerosis of the media of the small-sized and medium-sized 
      arteries is a well described and potentially life-threatening condition seen almost 
      exclusively in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and with 
      hyperparathyroidism. Penile gangrene resulting from this entity is associated with a 
      mortality as high as 64%. A 65-year-old man with ESRD on dialysis for 6 years was 
      referred to Harborview Medical Center with severe penile pain and partial necrosis 
      of his glans penis, which progressed despite medical management. The patient had 
      previously undergone amputations on all four extremities. After intraoperative 
      biopsies of the proximal corpora cavernosa and spongiosum demonstrated viable 
      tissue, he underwent partial penectomy. Pathologic evaluation revealed calciphylaxis 
      within the media of the penile vessels. Two months later the patient had persistent 
      wound-healing issues with intractable pain and thus underwent a complete penectomy 
      with ultimate resolution of his severe pain.

AB  - Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular 
      events in the general population. Recent data confirm the prognostic utility of 
      single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging in end-stage renal 
      disease, but whether performing CACS as part of hybrid imaging improves risk 
      prediction in this population is unclear. Consecutive patients (n = 284) were 
      identified after referral to a university hospital for cardiovascular risk 
      stratification in assessment for renal transplantation. Participants underwent 
      technetium-99m SPECT imaging after exercise or standard adenosine stress in those 
      unable to achieve 85% maximal heart rate; multislice CACS was also performed 
      (Siemens Symbia T16, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Subjects with known coronary 
      artery disease (n = 88) and those who underwent early revascularization (n = 2) were 
      excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of death or first myocardial 
      infarction. An abnormal SPECT perfusion result was seen in 22% (43 of 194) of 
      subjects, whereas 45% (87 of 194) had at least moderate CACS (>100 U). The frequency 
      of abnormal perfusion (summed stress score ≥4) increased with increasing CACS 
      severity (p = 0.049). There were a total of 15 events (8 deaths, and 7 myocardial 
      infarctions) after a median duration of 18 months (maximum follow-up 3.4 years). 
      Univariate analysis showed diabetes mellitus (Hazard ratio [HR] 3.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 
      9.54; p = 0.028), abnormal perfusion on SPECT (HR 5.32, 95% CI 1.84 to 15.35; p = 
      0.002), and moderate-to-severe CACS (HR 3.55, 95% CI 1.11 to 11.35; p = 0.032) were 
      all associated with the primary outcome. In a multivariate model, abnormal perfusion 
      on SPECT (HR 4.18, 95% CI 1.43 to 12.27; p = 0.009), but not moderate-to-severe CACS 
      (HR 2.50, 95% CI 0.76 to 8.20; p = 0.130), independently predicted all-cause death 
      or myocardial infarction. The prognostic value of CACS was not incremental to 
      clinical and SPECT perfusion data (global chi-square change = 2.52, p = 0.112). In 
      conclusion, a perfusion defect on SPECT is an independent predictor of adverse 
      outcome in potential renal transplant candidates regardless of the CACS. The use of 
      CACS as an adjunct to SPECT perfusion data does not provide incremental prognostic 
      utility for the prediction of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in 
      end-stage renal disease.

      evolution of arterial calcifications in hemodialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Seventy-two stable hemodialysis patients were randomly allocated to two groups: 36 
      administered a regimen containing magnesium carbonate plus calcium acetate as a 
      phosphate binder (Mg group), while the rest 36 received calcium acetate alone (Ca 
      group). The presence and the progression of arterial calcifications were evaluated 
      in plain X-rays using a simple vascular calcification score. The duration of the 
      follow-up period was 12 months. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients of the Mg group and 27 
      of the Ca group completed the study. The mean time average values of the biochemical 
      laboratories did not differ between the two groups, except serum Mg: 2.83 + 0.38 in 
      the Mg group versus 2.52 + 0.27 mg/dl in the Ca group, p = 0.001. In 9/32 (28.12 %) 
      patients of the Mg group and in 12/27 (44.44 %) patients of the Ca group, the 
      arterial calcifications were worsened, p = 0.276. Moreover, in 4/32 (15.6 %) 
      patients of the Mg group and in 0/27 (0 %) patients of the Ca group, they were 
      improved, p = 0.040. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      serum magnesium was an independent predictor for no progression of the arterial 
      calcifications, p = 0.047. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium probably retards the arterial 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients. Further clinical studies are needed to 
      clarify whether magnesium provides cardiovascular protection to this group of 
      patients.

TI  - Effects of Lowering Dialysate Calcium Concentration on Mineral and Bone Disorders in 
      Chronic Hemodialysis Patients: Conversion from 3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12329 [doi]
AB  - Selection of a lower dialysate calcium concentration (DCa) can reduce calcium burden 
      and prevent vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. However, decreased DCa 
      can worsen mineral and bone disorders. This 1-year retrospective observational study 
      evaluated 121 hemodialysis patients at Fukuoka Renal Clinic who underwent conversion 
      of DCa from 3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L. The primary outcomes were changes in serum 
      levels of calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The effects of baseline 
      serum calcium and PTH levels on changes in biochemical parameters were also 
      determined. One year after DCa conversion, mean serum calcium level decreased, while 
      serum phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH concentrations increased. The rate of 
      achievement of target PTH was higher in patients with lower serum PTH level at 
      baseline, while patients with higher baseline serum PTH level tended to exceed the 
      upper limit of the PTH target range. Patients with higher baseline serum calcium 
      concentration showed a greater decrease in serum calcium level and a greater 
      increase in serum PTH level at 1 year. Patients with a lower baseline serum PTH 
      level can benefit from optimal PTH control following conversion of DCa from 
      3.0 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L. However, secondary hyperparathyroidism may be exacerbated 
      in some patients with higher baseline serum calcium (Ca) and PTH levels. These 
      results indicate that an individualized approach can maximize the benefits of Ca 
      unloading after conversion to lower DCa.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification evaluated on chest X-ray is a strong independent predictor 
      of cardiovascular events in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 135-42
LID - 10.1007/s00380-011-0129-1 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. Some reports have previously shown that simple assessment of aortic 
      calcification using plain radiography is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events; 
      however, these studies simply assessed whether aortic calcification was present or 
      absent only, without considering its extent. Here, we evaluated the validity of 
      grading aortic arch calcification (AoAC) to predict new CV events. We 
      retrospectively reviewed chest X-rays in 212 asymptomatic HD patients who underwent 
      measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 2006 without a past history of CV 
      events. The extent of AoAC was divided into four grades (0-3). Among these subjects, 
      the follow-up of CV events in 197 patients was completed. At baseline, AoAC grade 
      was positively associated with age, dialysis vintage, PWV and parathyroid hormone 
      levels, and negatively correlated with body weight and body mass index. Arterial 
      stiffness, as determined by PWV, was also correlated with increasing AoAC grade. 
      Eighty-nine CV events in total occurred during a mean follow-up period of 
      69 ± 45 months. With multivariate adjustment, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 
      incidence was significantly higher in patients with higher AoAC grade (grades 2 and 
      3) than in those with grade 0 or 1 (p = 0.013, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox 
      proportional hazards analyses showed the predictive values of AoAC grade were 
      significant (hazard ratio 1.512; p = 0.0351). AoAC detectable on chest X-ray is a 
      strong independent predictor of CV events in accordance with PWV. Risk 
      stratification by assessment of AoAC may provide important information for 
      management of atherosclerotic disease in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) can predict 
      cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in hemodialysis patients. However, little is known 
      about the predictive value of AAC for CV outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients without hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      prevalence and the predictive value of AAC in asymptomatic CKD patients. METHODS: We 
      prospectively evaluated 347 asymptomatic CKD patients without hemodialysis [median 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 43.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)]. A non-contrast 
      computed tomography scan was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) as a semi-quantitative measure of AAC. The patients were divided into 
      three groups according to the tertiles of ACI. RESULTS: Among the subjects, AAC was 
      found (ACI > 0) in 296 patients (86.3%), and the median ACI was 11.4%. During the 
      median follow-up of 41.5 months, a total of 33 CV events were observed. Patients 
      with the highest tertile of ACI had the highest risk of CV outcomes compared with 
      the other two groups (96.5%, 93.0%, and 74.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The Cox 
      proportional hazard models showed that ACI was an independent predictor of CV 
      outcomes (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.60, p < 0.001). The 
      C-index was also significantly increased by adding eGFR and ACI values to the model 
      along with the other conventional risk factors (0.79 versus 0.66, p = 0.043). 
      CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the AAC provides useful information for predicting adverse 
      clinical outcomes among asymptomatic CKD patients without hemodialysis.

TI  - Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study 
      evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved 
      knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We 
      assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size 
      (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification 
      (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a 
      prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-four 
      dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included 
      in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC 
      score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels 
      (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the 
      multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. 
      RESULTS: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification 
      scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) 
      died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart 
      failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were 
      included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), 
      area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], 
      AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) 
      were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant 
      after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not 
      increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not 
      improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on 
      multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges 
      were based on 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on 
      chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis 
      patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac 
      size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve 
      prognostication in this population.

TI  - Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed 
      tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0620-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular 
      disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. 
      Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these 
      measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to 
      determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for 
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computed tomography with contrast medium was 
      performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average 
      age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the 
      volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients 
      were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or 
      hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic 
      abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, 
      and hospitalization or death due to heart failure. RESULTS: Patients were followed 
      for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and 
      male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In 
      contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, 
      maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, 
      or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional 
      computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - [Calcific uremic arteriolopathy - treatment with sodium thiosulfate].
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy or calciphylaxis is a rare disorder characterized by 
      systemic medial calcification of arterioles that leads to ischemia and subcutaneous 
      necrosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease who are 
      on haemodialysis or who have received a renal transplant. Calciphylaxis is dangerous 
      by its fast progression into tissue necrosis, difficult healing process and a great 
      risk of secondary infection which is the most common cause of death in this 
      condition. The reported mortality rates are as high as 60-80 % in a couple of months 
      once it is diagnosed. The key to successful treatment of calciphylaxis is fast 
      diagnosing of the disease and appropriate treatment management. On the examples of 
      three patients from our haemodialysis centre we demonstrate typical clinical 
      manifestation of calciphylaxis and its treatment, which requires close 
      patient-medical staff cooperation. The basic principle of treatment of all our 
      patients was normalization of calcium-phosphate metabolism and secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism. Sodium thiosulfate had been administered to all patients at the 
      end of haemodialysis session. The wound care played another major role with gentle 
      debridement and intensive local care. After five to six months the skin defects 
      resolved in the first patient, partially resolved in the second patient and 
      deteriorated in the third patient. We have observed no side effects of sodium 
      thiosulfate application.

TI  - Elevated serum bone morphogenetic protein 4 in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      and coronary artery disease.
PG  - 232-8
LID - 10.1007/s12265-012-9429-9 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and coronary artery calcification. We hypothesized that the osteogenic factor, 
      bone morphogenetic protein-4 (sBMP-4), is elevated in subjects with both CKD and 
      CAD. Serum was collected from 79 subjects undergoing diagnostic angiography and 
      stratified according to CAD and CKD status. Subjects with both CAD and CKD had 
      significantly elevated sBMP-4 compared to those with only one or no disease. sBMP-4 
      continued to be associated with the presence of both diseases after adjustment for 
      other risk factors. To determine if sBMP-4 is associated with coronary artery 
      calcification, we compared coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) to sBMP-4 in 22 
      subjects. A positive correlation between CAC and sBMP-4 was seen. In conclusion, 
      sBMP-4 is elevated in patients with both CAD and CKD and positively correlates with 
      CAC, suggesting a role for sBMP-4 in the increased CAD seen in CKD patients.

TI  - Effects of phosphorus-restricted diet and phosphate-binding therapy on outcomes in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 73-80
LID - 10.1007/s40620-014-0071-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phosphorus is associated with mortality in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) not on dialysis, possibly through phosphorus-dependent vascular 
      calcification. Although a phosphorus-restricted diet reduces serum phosphorus, it is 
      unlikely that it reduces vascular calcification progression in CKD. This study 
      evaluated whether a combined strategy of phosphorus-restricted diet and 
      phosphate-binding therapy can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and/or dialysis 
      initiation by attenuating coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression in 
      non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of 
      patients from a study that evaluated the impact of two phosphorus binder regimens on 
      hard outcomes in CKD. Patients (n = 113) with stage 3-4 CKD and evidence of CAC on a 
      phosphorus-restricted diet were randomized to receive either calcium carbonate or 
      sevelamer added to their phosphorus-restricted diet. End-points were death for any 
      cause and initiation of dialysis. Patients were monitored to the first event or to 
      conclusion of the 36-month follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, treatment with calcium 
      carbonate was associated with increased CAC progression and occurrence of all-cause 
      mortality, dialysis initiation, and the composite end-point. After adjustment for 
      confounders, sevelamer use was the only independent predictive factor of reduced 
      risk of each endpoint but only if CAC progression was either absent or moderate. 
      Accelerated progression (annual CAC increase >75th percentile of the study cohort) 
      increased the risk of all-cause mortality and composite end-point (p = 0.01) 
      independently of the use of sevelamer. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in 
      all-cause mortality, dialysis initiation, and composite end-point risk was achieved 
      by combining phosphorus-restricted diet and sevelamer in non-dialysis CKD patients 
      with absent or moderate but not accelerated CAC progression. Future studies should 
      investigate the role of serum phosphorus, the usefulness of a phosphorus-restricted 
      diet, and the appropriateness of current normal ranges of serum phosphorus 
      concentration in relation to events in non-dialyzed CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is increasingly evident that patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) are more likely to die from heart disease than kidney failure. This study 
      evaluated whether pre- dialysis CKD is an independent risk factor for coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC). METHODS: A total of 544 consecutive patients who underwent CAC 
      scoring were analyzed. Eleven patients requiring hemodialysis were excluded. 
      Patients were divided into three groups: normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
      (GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m²), mild CKD (90 ≥ GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and moderate CKD 
      (60 ≥ GFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Continuous and categorical variables were compared 
      using analysis of variance and the χ² statistic. A multiple logistic regression 
      model was used for detecting the association between total CAC score and GFR. An 
      unadjusted model was used, followed by a second model adjusted for covariates known 
      to be related to CAC. Another multivariable binary logistic model predicting the 
      presence of CAC (>10) was performed and odds of incidence of CAC (>10) were 
      calculated among the three GFR subgroups. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, 
      patients with mild CKD had mean CAC scores 175 points higher than those with the 
      referent normal GFR (P = 0.048), while those with moderate CKD had mean CAC scores 
      693 points higher than the referent (P < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, 
      patients with mild CKD were found to be 2.2 times more likely (95% confidence 
      interval 1.3-3.7, P = 0.004) and patients with moderate CKD were 6.4 times more 
      likely (95% confidence interval 2.9-14.3, P < 0.001) to have incident CAC compared 
      with the group with normal GFR. CONCLUSION: Mild and moderate pre-dialysis CKD are 
      independent risk factors for increased mean and incident CAC.

TI  - Pulmonary vascular calcification in a nocturnal hemodialysis patient.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Although vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is common, 
      metastatic pulmonary calcification (MPC) is an under-recognized complication of ESRD 
      with the majority of individuals being asymptomatic. Similar to calcification in 
      other arterial vascular beds, elevated serum calcium and phosphate appear to be 
      potent risk factors although the exact pathogenesis of MPC remains largely unclear. 
      Nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) is a form of renal replacement therapy that offers 
      superior control of serum phosphate and uremia compared to conventional (3 times 
      weekly) intermittent hemodialysis and shows promise in delaying the progression of 
      vascular calcification. Here, we report the first case of MPC involving the 
      pulmonary vasculature in a patient treated with nocturnal hemodialysis and discuss 
      the epidemiology, pathogenesis, histology and natural history of MPC.

AB  - Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with advanced chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) is challenging due to frequent presence of complex calcified lesions 
      and the very high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We report a strategy 
      of "zero contrast" PCI, guided by intravascular imaging and physiology, performed in 
      three patients with advanced CKD in whom severe calcification necessitated 
      rotational atherectomy (RA) to facilitate and optimize PCI. This approach resulted 
      in safe and successful PCI while preserving renal function. © 2017 Wiley

AB  - Diurnal variations in blood pressure (BP) loss are closely associated with target 
      organ damage and cardiovascular events. The quantity of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) correlates with the atherosclerotic plaque burden, and an 
      increased quantity indicates a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular 
      events. This study investigated the nighttime diurnal variation in BP loss 
      associated with CAC in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Of the 1958 
      participants, we enrolled 722 participants with CKD without a history of acute 
      coronary syndrome or symptomatic coronary artery disease. CAC was measured with 
      computed tomography. BP was measured using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Central 
      BP was measured using a SphygmoCor waveform analysis system.Participants with CAC 
      had significantly higher 24-hour systolic, daytime systolic, and nighttime systolic 
      ambulatory BP and central systolic BP. The percentage of participants with dipping 
      loss was significantly higher among those with CAC. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that dipping loss and dipping ratio were independently associated 
      with CAC after adjusting for traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors and other BP parameters, including measurements of office-measured BP and 
      central BP. The dipping status improved risk prediction for CAC after considering 
      traditional risk factors and office-measured BP, using the net reclassification 
      improvement and integrated discrimination improvement.Nighttime loss of diurnal 
      variation in BP is an independent risk factor for CAC in CKD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical usefulness of physiological and radiological examinations 
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification has not been fully demonstrated 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In the present study, predictive values of 
      CVD were investigated among asymptomatic CKD patients by comprehensive and 
      non-invasive CVD screening programs. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 139 
      asymptomatic CKD patients. All patients were examined by comprehensive and 
      non-invasive CVD risk screening programs that included carotid ultrasonography, 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS), pulse wave velocity, and flow-mediated 
      vasodilation, and their associations with major adverse cardiovascular events 
      (MACEs) were analyzed. RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 32.3 months, 13 MACEs 
      were observed. Among all CVD screening examinations, severity of the carotid plaque 
      score (PS) and CACS was significantly higher in the MACE group than in the MACE-free 
      group (11.3 ± 5.8 versus 6.1 ± 5.3, P = 0.001 and 657 versus 74, P = 0.020, 
      respectively). Kaplan-Meier curves for the incidences of MACEs classified according 
      to the combination of carotid PS and CACS showed that severe carotid PS and severe 
      CACS groups had the highest event rate in comparison with the groups without any of 
      these (29.9, 11.9, and 3.6 %, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      long-term follow-up analysis, the combination of carotid atherosclerosis and CACS 
      was a useful and non-invasive screening tool for predicting cardiovascular events 
      among asymptomatic CKD patients.

AB  - The impact of lesion calcium on long-term outcomes after drug-eluting stent 
      implantation has not been adequately addressed. In 10,595 patients (16,803 lesions) 
      who were exclusively treated with sirolimus-eluting stents in the j-Cypher registry, 
      5-year outcomes were compared between patients with ≥1 lesion with moderate or 
      severe calcification (the calcium group) and those with noncalcified lesions only 
      (the noncalcium group). Analyses were stratified by hemodialysis (HD) status (non-HD 
      stratum [calcium n = 3,191, noncalcium n = 6,824] and HD stratum [calcium n = 415, 
      noncalcium n = 165]). Adjusted risk in the calcium group for death and target lesion 
      revascularization was significant in the non-HD stratum (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.52, p <0.0001, and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.36, p 
      = 0.003) and the HD stratum (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.86, p = 0.02, and HR 2.25, 95% 
      CI 1.51 to 3.36, p <0.0001). Risk for definite stent thrombosis tended to be higher 
      in the calcium group in the HD stratum (HR 5.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 38.9, p = 0.12) but 
      not in then non-HD stratum (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.67, p = 0.41). The use of 
      rotational atherectomy in patients with severe calcification did not have a 
      significant impact on the cumulative incidence of target lesion revascularization in 
      the non-HD stratum (17.7% [n = 268] with vs 18.2% [n = 588] without rotational 
      atherectomy, p = 0.68) and the HD stratum (54.7% [n = 115] with vs 51.9% [n = 118] 
      without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.19). In conclusion, regardless of HD status, 
      patients with calcified lesions have increased long-term risk for death and target 
      lesion revascularization after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation.

TI  - Sequence variation in vitamin K epoxide reductase gene is associated with survival 
      and progressive coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1591-6
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sequence variations in the gene(s) encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase 
      complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), the enzyme target of warfarin, have been associated with 
      increased cardiovascular disease in the general population. Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) is a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney 
      disease. We tested the hypothesis that the VKORC1 rs8050894 CC genotype would be 
      associated with mortality and progression of CAC ≤ 4 years. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 
      This study is an observational, prospective study of 167 individuals with stages 3 
      to 5 chronic kidney disease. Survival ≤ 4 years was assessed in all participants, 
      and CAC progression was measured in a subset of 86 patients. Participants with the 
      CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had higher baseline CAC scores (median score, 112 versus 
      299; P=0.036). Of those 86 patients who had a 4-year CAC score, those with the CG/GG 
      genotype had an increased risk of progressive CAC (adjusted for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension) compared with 
      those with the CC genotype. Four-year mortality risk was 4 times higher for 
      individuals with the CG/GG genotypes compared with individuals with the CC genotype 
      (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.5; P=0.02), adjusted for age, sex, 
      diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline CAC, and 
      hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had a higher 
      risk of CAC progression and a poorer survival. These data provide new perspectives 
      on the potential extrahepatic role of VKORC1 in individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease.

TI  - Plasma levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and 
      proinflammatory ligand for RAGE (EN-RAGE) are associated with carotid 
      atherosclerosis in patients with peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 208-14
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.07.115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) exerts 
      a protective effect on the development of atherosclerotic vascular complications by 
      inhibiting RAGE-mediated inflammatory response. In contrast, extracellular newly 
      identified RAGE-binding protein (EN-RAGE) contributes to increased atherosclerosis 
      as a pro-inflammatory ligand for RAGE. We determined the levels of sRAGE and EN-RAGE 
      in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and evaluated their relationship with carotid 
      atherosclerosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 91 PD patients 
      and 29 control subjects. Carotid IMT (cIMT) and abdominal aortic vascular 
      calcification score (VCS) were evaluated using high-resolution B-mode 
      ultrasonography and plain radiographic film of the lateral abdomen. RESULTS: Plasma 
      sRAGE and EN-RAGE levels were more than twice as higher in PD patients compared to 
      controls. EN-RAGE showed a strong positive correlation with serum high-sensitivity 
      CRP (p=0.007) and IL-6 (p=0.002), whereas sRAGE was negatively associated with those 
      inflammatory markers (p=0.001, p=0.031). Even after adjustments for traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, both sRAGE and EN-RAGE were independently associated 
      with cIMT (β=-0.230, p=0.037, β=0.155, p=0.045) and VCS (β=-0.205, p=0.049, β=0.197, 
      p=0.156). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that old age (OR 1.14, 95% CI 
      1.03-1.25, p=0.009), presence of diabetes (OR 13.4, 95% CI: 1.20-150.18, p=0.035) 
      and elevated plasma EN-RAGE (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.05-5.11, p=0.048) were significant 
      predictors for the occurrence of carotid atherosclerosis (cIMT>1.0mm and/or plaque 
      formation). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that elevated plasma EN-RAGE and 
      decreased sRAGE level could play a crucial role in systemic inflammation and carotid 
      atherosclerosis in PD patients.

TI  - A decreased level of serum soluble Klotho is an independent biomarker associated 
      with arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e56695
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0056695 [doi]
LID - e56695
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klotho was originally identified in a mutant mouse strain unable to 
      express the gene that consequently showed shortened life spans. In humans, low serum 
      Klotho levels are related to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in 
      community-dwelling adults. However, it is unclear whether the serum Klotho levels 
      are associated with signs of vascular dysfunction such as arterial stiffness, a 
      major determinant of prognosis, in human subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
      METHODS: We determined the levels of serum soluble Klotho in 114 patients with CKD 
      using ELISA and investigated the relationship between the level of Klotho and 
      markers of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and various types of vascular 
      dysfunction, including flow-mediated dilatation, a marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction, ankle-brachial pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a marker of arterial 
      stiffness, intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of atherosclerosis, and the aortic 
      calcification index (ACI), a marker of vascular calcification. RESULTS: The serum 
      Klotho level significantly correlated with the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and 
      inversely correlated with the parathyroid hormone level and the fractional excretion 
      of phosphate. There were significant decreases in serum Klotho in patients with 
      arterial stiffness defined as baPWV≥1400 cm/sec, atherosclerosis defined as maximum 
      IMT≥1.1 mm and vascular calcification scores of ACI>0%. The serum Klotho level was a 
      significant determinant of arterial stiffness, but not endothelial dysfunction, 
      atherosclerosis or vascular calcification, in the multivariate analysis in either 
      metabolic model, the CKD model or the CKD-MBD model. The adjusted odds ratio of 
      serum Klotho for the baPWV was 0.60 (p = 0.0075). CONCLUSIONS: Decreases in the 
      serum soluble Klotho levels are independently associated with signs of vascular 
      dysfunction such as arterial stiffness in patients with CKD. Further research 
      exploring whether therapeutic approaches to maintain or elevate the Klotho level 
      could improve arterial stiffness in CKD patients is warranted.

AB  - AIM: To determine the nature of changes in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and 
      other bone mineral metabolism parameters detectable in the blood of patients with 
      end-stage chronic renal failure (CRF) and to analyze their links to the development 
      of cardiovascular events in uremic intoxication. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 
      patients (45 men and 30 women) aged 23 to 66 years (mean age, 53±2.1 years) with 
      Stage VD CKF were examined. The levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, 
      phosphorus, the morphogenetic protein FGF-23, and the cardiospecific protein 
      troponin I were investigated. Doppler echocardiography was performed on an Aloka 
      4000 machine. Left ventricular (LV) mass index (LVMI), LV systolic and diastolic 
      function, and peak systolic blood flow velocity in the aortic arch (Vps) were 
      estimated. RESULTS: As LVMI became higher, there were increases in the level of PTH 
      and that of FGF-23 that plays a significant role in the processes of bone remodeling 
      and vascular calcification. Analysis of correlations between a change in FGF-23 
      concentrations depending on the morphological and functional parameters of the 
      cardiovascular system (CVS) revealed a strong direct correlation between FGF-23 
      levels and LVMI (r=0.746; p<0.01), a significant inverse correlation between FGF-23 
      and ejection fraction (r=-0.901; p<0.05), and a direct correlation of FGF-23 and 
      troponin I (r=0.544; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: FGF-2 increasing from moderate to very 
      high levels indicates that there is a high risk for remodeling processes in the CVS 
      even in the absence of baseline echocardiographic signs of myocardial hypertrophy, 
      normal aortic pulse wave velocity, and compensation of other risk factors, such as 
      hypertension, uremia, hyperparathyroidism, even without increasing the markers of 
      cardiovascular events, such as hyperphosphatemia. The elevated level of FGF-23 
      suggests that there is a need for cardioprotective therapy, the goal of which is to 
      correct of the level of this factor.

TI  - Associations of atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta on CTA with 
      arterial stiffness and chronic kidney disease in asymptomatic patients with diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 1151-9
LID - 10.1007/s10554-014-0441-9 [doi]
AB  - The relation between atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aortic (DTA), 
      arterial stiffness and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) remains unclear. The current aim was to evaluate associations of DTA 
      atherosclerosis with arterial stiffness and parameters of CKD in asymptomatic 
      patients with DM. A total of 213 asymptomatic patients with diabetes (mean age 52 
      years, 56% men) underwent cardiovascular risk assessment including multi-slice 
      computed tomography (for non-invasive coronary angiography, from which DTA 
      atherosclerosis can be derived), non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness with 
      applanation tonometry and assessment of renal function. Measurements of DTA 
      atherosclerosis included assessment of DTA thickening and calcium score. Arterial 
      stiffness was determined by the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), 
      parameters of CKD included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary 
      albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR). DTA atherosclerosis was present in 180 (84%) 
      patients. Patients with DTA atherosclerosis had increased arterial stiffness, lower 
      eGFR and higher UACR values. After multivariate correction, DTA calcium score was 
      independently associated with PWV (β = 0.18, p = 0.04). Furthermore, both DTA 
      maximal wall thickness and DTA calcium score were independently associated with eGFR 
      (β = -7.37, p < 0.001 and β = -1.99, p < 0.003, respectively), but not with UACR. 
      The increase in arterial stiffness by atherosclerosis seemed to be mediated by 
      arterial calcification, while the DTA calcium score was independently associated 
      with arterial stiffness, but not DTA maximal wall thickness. Furthermore, parameters 
      of CKD in patients with DM had a distinct relationship with DTA atherosclerosis: DTA 
      atherosclerosis was associated with eGFR but not with UACR.

TI  - Trends of elevated parathormone serum titers in hemodialysis patients on intensive 
      therapy for bone disease: a multicenter study.
PG  - 1166-77
AB  - To determine the prevalence of controlled parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum levels 
      with intensified therapy for chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder 
      (CKD-MBD) in the dialysis population, we studied 563 chronic hemodialysis patients 
      recruited from three different dialysis centers from three different major cities in 
      the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The trend of the routine monthly chemistries related to 
      CKD-MBD was evaluated besides the whole-molecule PTH serum levels over 28 months 
      (January 2011 to April 2013). The cost ratios of the medications to the estimated 
      dialysis total cost were calculated. There were 323 (57.4%) males in the study, and 
      the mean age of the patients was 50.2±15.2 years; 371 (65.9%) patients were 
      initiated on dialysis before 2011. The causes of the original kidney disease 
      included diabetes mellitus in 163 (29%) patients. Parathyroidectomy was performed in 
      23 (4.1%) patients and only six (23%) patients underwent the operation during the 
      study period; most of the parathyroidectomies (69%) were performed before 2011. The 
      trend of the medians of monthly serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, albumin, 
      bicarbonate, alkaline phosphatase, serum levels of PTH and vitamin D25 assays showed 
      better control of the levels with time. The added cost of cinacalcet was more 
      significant than the other drugs, including vitamin D and phosphate binders, but the 
      cost was minimal in comparison with the whole dialysis bill. The ratios of the 
      discontinuation rates to the total patient-months of treatment for the different 
      drugs were in the range of 3-4% and mostly due to transient overdosing of 
      medications. We conclude that the trends of the median serum levels of PTH and 
      related minerals in the CKD patients in our dialysis patients suggested a good 
      inclination toward control and prevention of the vascular calcifications prevalent 
      in the CKD-MBD. The popularity of use of new drugs such as cinacalcet is promising 
      and does not seem to add much to the current out-patient cost of chronic dialysis.

AB  - Vascular complications arise in uremic patients in the absence of clinically 
      significant atherosclerotic disease. Elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 
      abnormal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) balance have been implicated in vascular 
      damage in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, but there is lack of 
      histo-pathological studies. Patients with CKD stage 5 and 5D who underwent 
      arterio-venous fistula were included in this study. Baseline and laboratory 
      parameters including assessment of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, albumin, 
      calcium, phosphorus, intact PTH (iPTH) and vitamin D level were documented. The 
      specimens of the arterial wall were obtained during the procedure and were analyzed. 
      Patients were divided into two groups iPTH <400 (Group A) and iPTH >400 (Group B). 
      Mean intimal thickness (IT) was significantly high in patients of Group B (60.4 ± 
      24.1 μ m) as compared with patients of Group A (37.8 ± 14.9 μm) (P = 0.003). 
      Vascular calcification was comparable in both groups. The iPTH level was found to be 
      an independent risk factor for high intima thickness (correlation coefficient 0.653) 
      (P-value <0.01). Patients with high (≥ 400 pg/mL) iPTH have 8.93 times the risk of 
      developing intimal thickness of ≥ 60 μ m as compared with patients with low (<400 
      pg/mL) iPTH (P-value <0.05), with 95% confidence interval of 1.27, 62.61. The mean 
      IT of the radial artery significantly correlated with the iPTH level, while vascular 
      calcification was independent of the iPTH level. Hyperparathyroidism is an important 
      cause of ongoing vascular damage and may contribute to higher vascular events in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Increased levels of serum parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23 are 
      the main factors associated with the progression of vascular calcification in 
      long-hour hemodialysis patients.
PG  - c132-8

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the frequency and factors associated with 
      the progression of vascular calcifications (VCs) using a semiquantitative X-ray 
      score. We included all prevalent hemodialysis patients with initial radiological 
      scores ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity of the VCs. Patients were 
      classified as non-progressors or progressors after 3 years. Among the 85 patients, 
      44.7% were classified as progressors. Only exhibiting high levels of serum intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH, >190 pg/ml) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23 levels 
      (>3,000 RU/ml) is associated with the risk of VC progression (OR 5.8, 95% CI 
      1.7-19.8, p = 0.004). Calcitriol analogs (38%), cinacalcet (15%), dialysate calcium 
      (mean 1.48 mmol/l), dialysis session time (4-8 h) and calcium- (10%) and 
      non-calcium-based phosphate binders (38%) were prescribed on an individual basis. 
      Hyperphosphatemia (<10%) and, especially, hypercalcemia (1%) and hyperparathyroidism 
      (>585 pg/ml = 0%) were infrequently observed. In conclusion, the main factor 
      associated with VC progression was the association of higher serum PTH and FGF-23 
      levels. It remains to be seen whether patients should be treated to lower their PTH 
      value, even within the target range, using calcitriol analogs, calcimimetics, 
      parathyroidectomy, or by modifying the Klotho-FGF-23 axis.

TI  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy ameliorated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in 
      high-altitude area.
PG  - 1139-41
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2014.917672 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), previously called calciphylaxis, 
      is a devastating complication of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with an annual 
      incidence of 1-4% in dialysis patients and the mortality is as high as 80%. The 
      rarity of the disease and the multifactorial nature of its causes have compromised 
      good evidences that could determine the best therapy for the condition. For 
      inhabitants in high-altitude area, the content of oxygen in the air is significantly 
      lower than that in sea level area, which leads to the differences in the clinical 
      manifestations and treatments to CUA. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a patient with 
      CUA on Tibetan Plateau successfully treated by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). This 
      46-year-old uremic Tibetan peasant received hemodialysis for 10 years, and over the 
      last six months, skin necrosis occurred progressively on the distal joint of the 
      middle finger of his right hand and the distal knuckles became paled, hardened, and 
      severely painful. Extensive calcification of the arteries of both hands was revealed 
      and his serum phosphorus elevated and serum calcium decreased. After diagnosis of 
      CUA, patient was treated with HBO therapy for successive three weeks with a session 
      per day, on the basis of secondary infection prevention. Pain of the affected finger 
      was quickly alleviated in one week and the lesions of the affected finger healed in 
      two months. CONCLUSION: As the dialysis population in high-altitude area increasing 
      rapidly in recent years, this management strategy of improving focal oxygen supply 
      by HBO might act as a reference for the treatment of CUA patients in similar 
      conditions.

      catheter for hemodialysis.
PG  - 196-8
LID - 10.5301/jva.5000113 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcifications usually affect the arteries, while central vein 
      calcifications are rare. A 45-year-old hemodialysis patient underwent a chest CT 
      scan before central vein catheterization required for arteriovenous access 
      thrombosis, in July 2011. He was on hemodialysis since 1995 and from 2005 on 
      warfarin treatment because of repeated thrombosis and dysfunction of arteriovenous 
      fistula and central vein catheters (CVC). A previous tunneled CVC placed in the left 
      external jugular vein was removed in December 2010. Eight months later a chest CT 
      scan showed a 79-mm irregular, linear, tubular radiopaque density in the superior 
      vena cava and left brachiocephalic vein. The possibility of a retained catheter 
      fragment was considered, but the final diagnosis was: calcified "cast" adherent to 
      the vessel wall. This is the first report of an intravenous calcified "cast" 
      (originating from peri-catheter calcification) retained after removal of a tunneled 
      dialysis CVC. This finding is significant because it mimics a retained catheter 
      fragment possibly leading to misdiagnosis and exposing patients to additional risk 
      for unnecessary retrieving interventions. Catheter removal or over the wire 
      substitution in the presence of a calcified cast could also be considered a risky 
      procedure. Retained calcified cast should be included among the long-term 
      complications of hemodialysis CVCs. At the time of publication, the patient is alive 
      without any complication related to the pathology reported.

PG  - 89-93
LID - 10.1159/000355859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between fibroblast 
      growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and vascular calcifications (VC) in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 55 PD patients who 
      underwent pelvic X-ray to assess for VC. Patients with and without linear 
      calcifications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (27.3%) had linear 
      calcifications on pelvic X-ray. FGF-23 levels were higher in patients with VC (299.5 
      (30.4-2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8-1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic patients had lower 
      FGF-23 values (43.2 (14.9-134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8-2,410) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Patients 
      with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF-23 levels (70.6 (14.8-513) vs. 
      179.5 (30.4-2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not reach statistical 
      significance. FGF-23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis duration and HbA1c were 
      positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and ALP were negatively 
      associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF-23 levels, age, dialysis 
      duration and RRF to be associated with VC. CONCLUSIONS: FGF-23 levels are associated 
      with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed to clarify whether it is simply a 
      marker or a potential factor. It may prove to be an important therapeutic target for 
      VC management.

PG  - 2475-86
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2015030268 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to high Ca concentrations may influence the development of low-turnover 
      bone disease and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients on hemodialysis 
      (HD). In this randomized, controlled study, we investigated the effects of lowering 
      dialysate Ca level on progression of CAC and histologic bone abnormalities in 
      patients on HD. Patients on HD with intact parathyroid hormone levels ≤300 pg/ml 
      receiving dialysate containing 1.75 or 1.50 mmol/L Ca (n=425) were randomized to the 
      1.25-mmol/L Ca (1.25 Ca; n=212) or the 1.75-mmol/L Ca (1.75 Ca; n=213) dialysate 
      arm. Primary outcome was a change in CAC score measured by multislice computerized 
      tomography; main secondary outcome was a change in bone histomorphometric parameters 
      determined by analysis of bone biopsy specimens. CAC scores increased from 452±869 
      (mean±SD) in the 1.25 Ca group and 500±909 in the 1.75 Ca group (P=0.68) at baseline 
      to 616±1086 and 803±1412, respectively, at 24 months (P=0.25). Progression rate was 
      significantly lower in the 1.25 Ca group than in the 1.75 Ca group (P=0.03). The 
      prevalence of histologically diagnosed low bone turnover decreased from 85.0% to 
      41.8% in the 1.25 Ca group (P=0.001) and did not change in the 1.75 Ca group. At 24 
      months, bone formation rate, trabecular thickness, and bone volume were higher in 
      the 1.25 Ca group than in the 1.75 Ca group. Thus, lowering dialysate Ca levels 
      slowed the progression of CAC and improved bone turnover in patients on HD with 
      baseline intact parathyroid hormone levels ≤300 pg/ml.

TI  - Pericardial fat is associated with coronary artery calcification in non-dialysis

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently 
      related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated 
      the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis 
      dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional 
      analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without 
      manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% 
      hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal 
      visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF 
      as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate 
      logistic regression. CAC (calcium score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those 
      presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male 
      gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference 
      (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 
      85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the 
      multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left 
      ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the 
      presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained 
      associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is 
      independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

LID - 10.1007/s12928-013-0205-9 [doi]
AB  - A 75-year-old hemodialysis patient with right critical limb ischemia received 
      endovascular therapy for a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a diffusely calcified 
      superficial femoral artery (SFA). During a retrograde approach, a Brockenbrough 
      needle (BN) was able to penetrate the calcified hard plaque formed in the middle 
      segment of the CTO. Moreover, bougie dilatation with the BN allowed balloon crossing 
      and stent deployment, even after failure to pass a 2.0-mm monorail balloon across 
      the plaque. These results suggest that the BN offers a new therapeutic option in the 
      penetration and modification of severely calcified CTO in SFA.

TI  - Regression of vascular calcification in a parathyroidectomized patient on dialysis 
      with untreated hypocalcemia over 12-year follow-up .
PG  - 333-339
AB  - Although some experimental targets involved in calcium deposition are emerging, no 
      intervention has been described to reliably reverse vascular calcification (VC). We 
      report a case of severe VC regression in a parathyroidectomized patient on 
      hemodialysis over 12-year follow-up, highlighting the use of calcium-free phosphate 
      binders and a 2.5 mEq/L calcium dialysate for reducing calcium loading, despite 
      persistent asymptomatic hypocalcemia occurrences. This case suggests that 
      phosphate-binder choice and calcium dialysate concentration could be influenced by 
      other components of CKD-MBD besides biochemical parameters, such as the presence of 
      VC, so concluding that asymptomatic hypocalcemia may not be as harmful as once 
      supposed, and conferring greater prognostic weight to the presence of VC than to 
      calcium levels. .
