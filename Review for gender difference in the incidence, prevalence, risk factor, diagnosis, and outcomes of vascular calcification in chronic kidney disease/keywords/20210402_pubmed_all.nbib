TI  - Coronary Artery Calcification and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Death Among 
      Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 635-643

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in 
      dialysis-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there are sparse 
      data on the association of CAC with subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease and 
      all-cause mortality in this population. OBJECTIVE: To study the prospective 
      association of CAC with risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among 
      dialysis-naive patients with CKD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The prospective 
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study recruited adults with an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 7 clinical centers in the 
      United States. There were 1541 participants without cardiovascular disease at 
      baseline who had CAC scores. EXPOSURES: Coronary artery calcification was assessed 
      using electron-beam or multidetector computed tomography. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Incidence of cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction, 
      heart failure, and stroke) and all-cause mortality were reported every 6 months and 
      confirmed by medical record adjudication. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 
      5.9 years in 1541 participants aged 21 to 74 years, there were 188 cardiovascular 
      disease events (60 cases of myocardial infarction, 120 heart failures, and 27 
      strokes; patients may have had >1 event) and 137 all-cause deaths. In Cox 
      proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, education 
      level, physical activity, total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive treatment, 
      current cigarette smoking, diabetes status, body mass index, C-reactive protein 
      level, hemoglobin A1c level, phosphorus level, troponin T level, log N-terminal 
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, fibroblast growth factor 23 level, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria, the hazard ratios associated with per 1 
      SD log of CAC were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.16-1.69; P < .001) for cardiovascular disease, 
      1.44 (95% CI, 1.02-2.02; P = .04) for myocardial infarction, 1.39 (95% CI, 
      1.10-1.76; P = .006) for heart failure, and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94-1.51; P = .15) for 
      all-cause mortality. In addition, inclusion of CAC score led to an increase in the C 
      statistic of 0.02 (95% CI, 0-0.09; P < .001) for predicting cardiovascular disease 
      over use of all the above-mentioned established and novel cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Coronary artery calcification is 
      independently and significantly related to the risks of cardiovascular disease, 
      myocardial infarction, and heart failure in patients with CKD. In addition, CAC 
      improves risk prediction for cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and 
      heart failure over use of established and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors 
      among patients with CKD; however, the changes in the C statistic are small.

TI  - Serum phosphate levels and mortality risk among people with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 520-8
AB  - Elevated serum phosphate levels have been linked with vascular calcification and 
      mortality among dialysis patients. The relationship between phosphate and mortality 
      has not been explored among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A 
      retrospective cohort study was conducted from eight Veterans Affairs' Medical 
      Centers located in the Pacific Northwest. CKD was defined by two continuously 
      abnormal outpatient serum creatinine measurements at least 6 mo apart between 1999 
      and 2002. Patients who received chronic dialysis, those with a present or previous 
      renal transplant, and those without a recent phosphate measurement were excluded. 
      The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points were acute 
      myocardial infarction and the combined end point of myocardial infarction plus 
      death. A total of 95,619 veterans with at least one primary care or internal 
      medicine clinic contact from a Northwest VA facility and two or more outpatient 
      measurements of serum creatinine, at least 6 mo apart, between January 1, 1999, and 
      December 31, 2002, were identified. From this eligible population, 7021 patients met 
      our definition of CKD. After exclusions, 6730 CKD patients were available for 
      analysis, and 3490 had a serum phosphate measurement during the previous 18 mo. 
      After adjustment, serum phosphate levels >3.5 mg/dl were associated with a 
      significantly increased risk for death. Mortality risk increased linearly with each 
      subsequent 0.5-mg/dl increase in serum phosphate levels. Elevated serum phosphate 
      levels were independently associated with increased mortality risk among this 
      population of patients with CKD.

TI  - Kidney Function and Arterial Calcification in Major Vascular Beds.
PG  - e010930
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.118.010930 [doi]
LID - e010930
AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
      kidney function and arterial calcification in major vascular beds and to establish 
      whether arterial calcification mediates the relation between kidney function 
      measures and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) incidence. Methods and Results In 2241 
      participants from the Rotterdam Study (mean age 69 years, 52% female), kidney 
      function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio. All participants underwent noncontrast computed 
      tomography to quantify the amount of arterial calcification in the coronary 
      arteries, aortic arch, extracranial, and intracranial internal carotid arteries. We 
      used linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors, to evaluate the association between kidney function and arterial 
      calcification volume in the 4 vessel beds. Incidence rate of CVD was calculated in 3 
      groups of participants based on their kidney function and presence of arterial 
      calcification. We conducted mediation analysis to evaluate whether arterial 
      calcification mediates this association. We found that in age- and sex-adjusted 
      models, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin-to-creatinine 
      ratio were associated with larger calcification volumes in all 4 vascular beds. 
      Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the effect estimates. CVD 
      incidence was higher in participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and presence of arterial calcification compared with 
      individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 and no calcification. 
      After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, arterial calcification did not 
      mediate the association between kidney function measures and CVD incidence. 
      Conclusions The association of impaired kidney function and larger volumes of 
      arterial calcification is partly explained by cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial 
      calcification does not mediate the association between kidney function and CVD 
      beyond cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Phenotypic features of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 422-434
LID - 10.1111/joim.13012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5) are predisposed to 
      vascular calcification (VC), but the combined effect of factors associated with VC 
      was sparsely investigated. We applied the relaxed linear separability (RLS) feature 
      selection model to identify features that concomitantly associate with VC in CKD5 
      patients. METHODS: Epigastric arteries collected during surgery from living donor 
      kidney transplant recipients were examined to score the histological extent of 
      medial VC. Sixty-two phenotypic features in 152 patients were entered into RLS model 
      to differentiate between no-minimal VC (n = 93; score 0-1) and moderate-extensive VC 
      (n = 59; score 2-3). The subset of features associated with VC was selected on the 
      basis of cross-validation procedure. The strength of association of the selected 
      features with VC was expressed by the absolute value of 'RLS factor'. RESULTS: Among 
      62 features, a subset of 17 features provided optimal prediction of VC with 89% of 
      patients correctly classified into their groups. The 17 features included 
      traditional risk factors (diabetes, age, cholesterol, BMI and male sex) and markers 
      of bone metabolism, endothelial function, metabolites, serum antibodies and 
      mitochondrial-derived peptide. Positive RLS factors range from 1.26 to 4.05 
      indicating features associated with increased risk of VC, and negative RLS factors 
      range from -0.95 to -1.83 indicating features associated with reduced risk of VC. 
      CONCLUSION: The RLS model identified 17 features including novel biomarkers and 
      traditional risk factors that together concomitantly associated with medial VC. 
      These results may inform further investigations of factors promoting VC in CKD5 
      patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: The recent observation that urinary calcium excretion (UCE) drops 
      considerably with CKD and that this effect may occur beyond compensation for reduced 
      intestinal calcium absorption suggests that CKD per se is a state of sustained 
      positive calcium balance, a mechanism likely to contribute to vascular calcification 
      and CVD in CKD. However, the determinants of UCE reduction in CKD are not well 
      understood and there is a lack of clinical studies, particularly in the CKD 
      population. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate variables associated with 
      UCE in a CKD cohort. METHODS: Baseline data on 356 participants of the Progredir 
      Study, Sao Paulo, Brazil, essentially composed of CKD G3a-G4, were analyzed 
      according to UCE (24 h urine collection). RESULTS: Median 24 h UCE was 38 mg/day 
      (IQR 21-68 mg/day) and 0.48 mg/kg/day (IQR 0.28-0.82 mg/kg/day). In univariate 
      analysis, UCE was inversely related to age, phosphorus, 1-84 PTH, FGF-23 and 
      sclerostin, and positively associated with eGFR, DBP, 1,25(OH)(2-)vitamin D, 
      calcium, bicarbonate, total calorie intake and spironolactone use. After adjustments 
      for age, sex and eGFR, only 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, FGF-23, bicarbonate and 
      total calorie intake remained associated with it, but not PTH nor sclerostin. 
      Lastly, in a multivariable model, eGFR, serum 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, calcium, and 
      FGF-23 remained associated with UCE. Similar results were observed when calcium 
      fractional excretion was used instead of UCE, with eGFR, 1-25-vitamin D and FGF-23 
      remaining as independent associations. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CKD is 
      associated with very low levels of UCE and that 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D, serum calcium 
      and FGF-23 were independently associated with UCE in this population, raising the 
      question whether these factors are modulators of the tubular handling of calcium in 
      CKD.

TI  - Exercise behavior of degenerative mitral stenosis.
PG  - 1845-1853
LID - 10.1007/s10554-020-01898-2 [doi]
AB  - Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is increasingly encountered, particularly among 
      the elderly and those with chronic kidney disease, and is often associated with a 
      transvalvular gradient. In contrast to rheumatic mitral stenosis relatively little 
      is known about mitral stenosis due to MAC. We aimed to clarify whether exercise 
      limitation in this group is primarily due to valvular obstruction or ventricular 
      dysfunction resulting from multiple comorbidities. 20 patients with severe MAC 
      (bulky calcium deposits which restricted leaflet motion) were submitted to supine 
      bicycle exercise, measuring Doppler and echocardiographic parameters at baseline and 
      during exercise. They were compared 1:1 to subjects matched for age, sex, and left 
      ventricular wall thickness. At baseline MAC subjects had higher mean mitral valve 
      gradients (MVG) than comparison subjects (7.5 ± 3.8 vs 1.6 ± 0.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), 
      along with larger indexed left atrial volumes (54.4 ± 14.9 vs 34.0 ± 11.7 mL, 
      p < 0.0001) and reduced left atrial strains (reservoir, conduit, and booster pump). 
      With exercise MAC subjects reached higher levels of MVG (17.3 ± 8.4 vs 5.5 ± 2.5 mm 
      Hg, p < 0.0001), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (estimated from tricuspid 
      regurgitant jet [TR] velocity) and displayed a moderate correlation between ΔMVG and 
      ΔTR velocity (r(2) = 0.57). MAC subjects whose exercise MVG was ≥ 15 mm Hg all had a 
      peak pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 60 mm Hg. MAC subjects also had relative 
      chronotropic incompetence. Patients with severe MAC and a transvalvular gradient 
      experience large increases in MVG and pulmonary pressure with exercise, similar to 
      what has been described in rheumatic mitral stenosis. MAC may be an under-recognized 
      cause of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in older patients.

PG  - 14-22
LID - 10.1007/s12011-019-01685-8 [doi]
AB  - Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (HD) are known to have abnormal blood 
      concentrations of antioxidant minerals; concurrent oxidative stress can contribute 
      to increased vascular calcification. This study aims to evaluate the associations 
      between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of vascular 
      calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant minerals 
      (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and several promoters 
      and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP), fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9), and tissue inhibitors 
      of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in HD patients (n = 62) and 
      age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 30). Compared with healthy subjects, 
      HD patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu 
      and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn 
      ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that HD patients had significantly lower 
      concentrations of MGP and higher levels of FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and 
      MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios. We also observed significant relationships 
      between the concentrations of these minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD 
      patients. These results suggest that changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant 
      minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and 
      inflammatory status, thereby participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing long-term HD.

      Kidney and Pancreas-Kidney Transplant Recipients.

LID - 10.1159/000502328 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and 
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) 
      score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. METHODS: Between the 
      years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored 
      for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, 
      cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause 
      mortality. RESULTS: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC 
      (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 
      months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. 
      For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and 
      mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar 
      after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and 
      diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high 
      versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 
      (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), 
      and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking 
      history-adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with 
      high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than 
      recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted 
      risk-lowering strategies.

TI  - Calcification score evaluation in patients listed for renal transplantation.
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12888 [doi]
AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification 
      score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 
      2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney 
      disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The 
      difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in the 
      external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total iliac 
      vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease, and 
      diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk factor 
      (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total iliac 
      vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation 
      protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to 
      calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular calcification prior to 
      transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical decisions and to improve 
      patient safety and outcome in increasingly older transplant recipients.

TI  - Serum Calcification Propensity and Coronary Artery Calcification Among Patients With 
      CKD: The CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.

AB  - RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent among 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases risks for cardiovascular 
      disease events and mortality. We hypothesized that a novel serum measure of 
      calcification propensity is associated with CAC among patients with CKD stages 2 
      to 4. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Participants 
      from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study with baseline (n=1,274) and 
      follow-up (n=780) CAC measurements. PREDICTORS: Calcification propensity, quantified 
      as transformation time (T(50)) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, 
      with lower T(50) corresponding to higher calcification propensity. Covariates 
      included age, sex, race/ethnicity, clinical site, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate, proteinuria, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, number of antihypertensive 
      medications, current smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, total cholesterol 
      level, and use of statin medications. OUTCOMES: CAC prevalence, severity, incidence, 
      and progression. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear 
      models. RESULTS: At baseline, 824 (65%) participants had prevalent CAC. After 
      multivariable adjustment, T(50) was not associated with CAC prevalence but was 
      significantly associated with greater CAC severity among participants with prevalent 
      CAC: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 21% (95% CI, 6%-38%) greater CAC severity. 
      Among 780 participants followed up an average of 3 years later, 65 (20%) without 
      baseline CAC developed incident CAC, while 89 (19%) with baseline CAC had 
      progression, defined as annual increase≥100 Agatston units. After multivariable 
      adjustment, T(50) was not associated with incident CAC but was significantly 
      associated with CAC progression: 1-SD lower T(50) was associated with 28% (95% CI, 
      7%-53%) higher risk for CAC progression. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias in 
      follow-up analyses; inability to distinguish intimal from medial calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD stages 2 to 4, higher serum calcification 
      propensity is associated with more severe CAC and CAC progression.

TI  - The role of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use in vitamin K status.
PG  - e0203157
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203157 [doi]
LID - e0203157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal 
      disease and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. Both kidney 
      transplantation and phosphate binders may lower the risk of vascular calcification. 
      Vascular calcification is actively inhibited by vitamin-K-dependent matrix 
      γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP). Whether kidney transplantation or phosphate 
      binders affect vitamin K status is unknown. Therefore, we studied the influence of 
      kidney transplantation and phosphate binder use on vitamin K status. METHODS: We 
      measured plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a marker reflecting low 
      vitamin K status, in a cross-sectional study of patients on hemodialysis (n = 82), 
      peritoneal dialysis (n = 31) or who recently received a kidney transplantation (n = 
      36). By medication inventory, we assessed phosphate binder use. With linear 
      regression, we assessed the influence of kidney transplantation and phosphate binder 
      use on natural-log-transformed dp-ucMGP, adjusting for potential confounders. 
      RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 52±13 years; 102 (68%) were male. Dp-ucMGP levels 
      were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients (median 689 pmol/L) 
      compared to patients on dialysis (median 1537 pmol/L, p<0.001). Eighty-nine patients 
      on dialysis used phosphate binders. Using any phosphate binder was not associated 
      with dp-ucMGP levels (median 1637 pmol/L, p = 0.09) compared to no phosphate binders 
      (median 1142 pmol/L). Twenty-six patients used sevelamer monotherapy, which was 
      associated with higher dp-ucMGP levels (median 1740 pmol/L, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for age, sex and vitamin K antagonist use. CONCLUSIONS: Recent kidney 
      transplantation is associated with lower dp-ucMGP levels suggesting improved vitamin 
      K status after transplantation. Sevelamer monotherapy is associated with higher 
      dp-ucMGP levels suggesting worsening of vitamin K status. Both findings warrant more 
      attention to vitamin K status in patients on dialysis, as vitamin K is necessary for 
      protection against vascular calcification.

TI  - Does statins promote vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 137-148
LID - 10.1111/eci.12718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve 
      survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is 
      unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and 
      mortality in ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; 
      median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal 
      dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 
      (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor 
      (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated 
      in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism. 
      RESULTS: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate 
      analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, 
      male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and 
      mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use 
      of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 
      patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. 
      In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. 
      CONCLUSION: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of 
      inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular 
      calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

TI  - Chemerin inhibits vascular calcification through ChemR23 and is associated with 
      lower coronary calcium in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.1111/joim.12940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemerin is an adipokine that signals through the G protein-coupled 
      receptor ChemR23 and is associated with inflammation, glucose homeostasis, lipid 
      metabolism and renal function, all of which strongly influence cardiovascular risk. 
      However, elevated chemerin provides a survival advantage in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), but how this relates to the cardiovascular phenotype is 
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to establish the association 
      of chemerin with coronary calcification and to determine the effects of chemerin 
      signalling, through ChemR23, in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. 
      METHODS: Plasma chemerin was measured in 113 patients with CKD and 50 healthy 
      controls. All patients underwent computed tomography to determine coronary artery 
      calcium (CAC) score. VSMCs were isolated from wild-type and ChemR23 knock-out mice 
      and treated with chemerin. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses established creatinine, 
      cholesterol, body mass index and tumour necrosis factor as significant confounders 
      for circulating chemerin levels. Despite these positive associations with renal 
      function, cardiometabolic risk factors and inflammation, chemerin was inversely 
      associated with CAC both in an age- and sex-adjusted analysis and in a multivariate 
      analysis adjusting for the aforementioned confounders. In addition, circulating 
      chemerin levels were associated with the calcification inhibitors matrix gla protein 
      (MGP) and fetuin-A. Finally, chemerin significantly reduced phosphate-induced 
      calcification and increased MGP expression in VSMCs, whereas chemerin was devoid of 
      these effects in VSMCs lacking ChemR23. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results 
      suggest that chemerin signalling through ChemR23 in VSMCs protects against vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Arterial calcifications in the lower extremity, chest, and cardiac vessels 
      have been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relation between 
      arterial calcifications observed on routine hand and upper-extremity radiographs and 
      atherosclerosis has not been determined. This study examined whether arterial 
      calcifications found on hand radiographs are associated with CAD. METHODS: A record 
      review from a single institution identified 345 patients with both hand radiographs 
      and CAD screening with cardiac stress testing or coronary angiography. Patients with 
      chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or incomplete hand films were 
      excluded. We reviewed x-rays for findings of arterial calcifications. Cardiac 
      testing results were used to establish a baseline diagnosis of CAD. We made group 
      comparisons and employed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the 
      association between upper-extremity calcification and CAD. RESULTS: A total of 210 
      patients met inclusion criteria: 155 with CAD and 55 without it. Mean age was 72 
      years, body mass index was 28.8, and 54% were male. Patients had comorbidities of 
      hypertension (91%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes (39%), cerebrovascular accident 
      (9%), and a history of tobacco use (53%). Of 155 CAD patients, 67 had arterial 
      calcifications on hand radiographs (43%), compared with 6 of 55 without it (11%). In 
      a multivariable model controlling for sex, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, the 
      presence of arterial calcifications on hand plain films indicated a 6.2-fold 
      increased odds of CAD. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate that arterial 
      calcifications on hand radiographs are independently associated with CAD. This may 
      represent an opportunity to the treating physician as a point of referral or 
      investigation for underlying or occult CAD. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Prevalence III.

TI  - Plasma Complement Protein C3a Level Was Associated with Abdominal Aortic 
      Calcification in Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 496-505
LID - 10.1007/s12265-019-09885-2 [doi]
AB  - The complement system plays an important role in cardiovascular disease in patients 
      on hemodialysis. Vascular calcification is also one of the major causes of 
      cardiovascular disease. We want to investigate the relationship between complement 
      activation and vascular calcification in dialyzed patients. One hundred eight 
      hemodialysis patients and 65 heathy controls were enrolled prospectively. Plasma 
      C3a, C5a, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) 
      levels were detected using ELISA. Plasma C3c, fB, fH, C1q, and C4 levels were 
      measured by immunity transmission turbidity. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) 
      was measured by abdomen lateral plain radiograph, and the AAC score was calculated. 
      We identified increased level of MBL and decreased level of C3c and complement 
      factor B compared with normal control. However, C1q, complement factor H, and C4 
      levels remained at a similar level compared with individuals with normal renal 
      function. The C3a and C5a levels increased, without change of MAC. Forty two of 108 
      HD patients had the AAC score. C3a levels were correlated with AAC score (r = 0.461, 
      p = 0.002). The median C3a concentration was 238.72 (196.96, 323.41) ng/mL. When 
      evaluated as AAC categories (≤ 4, > 5) with ordinal logistic regression, univariate 
      analyses revealed that higher C3a levels were associated with severe AAC, while 
      multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, and calcium level showed that higher 
      C3a levels (OR, 6.28 (1.25-31.69); p = 0.03) were associated with severe AAC. The 
      areas under the curve (AUC) for C3a to diagnose severe abdominal aortic 
      calcification were 0.75(0.58-0.92, 0.01). The complement system was activated in 
      patients on hemodialysis. Higher C3a levels are independently associated with severe 
      AAC. Plasma C3a might have a diagnostic value for the severe AAC in HD patients.

      Kidney Transplant Recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: "T50," shortened transformation time from primary to secondary 
      calciprotein particles may reflect deranged mineral metabolism predisposing to 
      vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The glycoprotein fetuin-A 
      is a major T50 determinant. METHODS: The Folic Acid For Vascular Outcome Prevention 
      In Transplantation (FAVORIT) cohort is a completed, large, multiethnic controlled 
      clinical trial cohort of chronic, stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We 
      conducted a longitudinal case-cohort analysis using a randomly selected subcohort of 
      patients, and all individual cases who developed CVD. Serum T50 and fetuin-A were 
      determined in this total of n = 685 FAVORIT trial participants at randomization. 
      RESULTS: During a median surveillance of 2.18-years, 311 incident or recurrent CVD 
      events occurred. Shorter T50 (minutes) or reduced fetuin-A concentrations (g/L) were 
      associated with CVD after adjustment for treatment assignment, systolic blood 
      pressure, age, sex, race, preexisting CVD and diabetes, smoking, body mass index, 
      total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, kidney allograft vintage and type, calcineurin 
      inhibitor, or lipid-lowering drug use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 
      urinary albumin/creatinine: tertile 1 (lowest) to tertile 3 (highest) comparisons, 
      T50, (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.89); fetuin-A, (HR 2.25; 95% CI 
      1.38-3.69). Elevated high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) was an effect 
      modifier of both these associations. CONCLUSIONS: Shortened T50, as well as reduced 
      fetuin-A levels, ostensible promoters of vascular calcification, remained associated 
      with greater risk for CVD outcomes, after adjustment for major CVD risk factors, 
      measures of kidney function and damage, and KTR clinical characteristics and 
      demographics, in a large, multiethnic cohort of long-term KTRs. Increased hsCRP was 
      an effect modifier of these CVD risk associations.

TI  - Differences in association of lower bone mineral density with higher coronary 
      calcification in female and male end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 59

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk of cardiac events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD) patients are predicted by coronary artery calcification (CAC) 
      independently. It is not clear to what extent low bone mineral density (BMD) is 
      associated with higher risk of CAC and if sex interacts. We investigated the 
      sex-specific associations of CAC score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with 
      BMD of different skeletal sub-regions. METHODS: In 174 ESRD patients, median age 57 
      (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63% males, BMD (measured by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac CT) and circulating 
      inflammatory biomarkers were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 104 (60%) patients with 
      CAC > 100 AUs were older, had higher prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, 
      higher level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, 
      interleukin-6 and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower 
      tBMD and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients. Female 
      patients with high CAC (> 100 AUs) had significantly decreased T-score of tBMD, and 
      lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC (≤ 100 AUs); elevated CAC score were 
      associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no 
      such differences was observed in males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) 
      analysis adjusted for age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher 
      CAC score (1057 AUs) was predicted by either per SD (0.13 g/cm(2)) lower tBMD or per 
      SD (0.17 g/cm(2)) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found in male ESRD 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In female, but not male, lower BMD, in particular sub-regions 
      of legs, was associated with higher CAC score independently. Low BMD has the 
      potential to identify increased risk for high CAC score in ESRD patients.

TI  - Intrarenal resistive index conundrum: systemic atherosclerosis versus renal 
      arteriolosclerosis.
PG  - 930-936
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2019.1674159 [doi]
AB  - Background: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between biopsy-proven kidney 
      lesions, subclinical markers of atherosclerosis and intrarenal resistive index (RRI) 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: This cross-sectional, 
      single-center study prospectively enrolled 44 consecutive CKD patients (57% male 
      gender, 54.1 (95%CI, 49.7-58.6) years, median eGFR 28.1 (15.0-47.7) mL/min) 
      diagnosed by renal biopsy during 6 months in our clinic. RRI, carotid intima-media 
      thickness (IMT), Kauppila score for abdominal aortic calcification (AACs) were 
      assessed. Traditional and nontraditional atheroscleosis risk factors were also 
      evaluated. Results: Most of the patients had a diagnosis of glomerular nephropathy, 
      with IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy being the most frequent. RRI increased 
      proportionally with CKD stages. Patients with RRI >0.7 (39%) were older, had 
      diabetic and vascular nephropathies more frequently, higher mean arterial blood 
      pressure, increased systemic atherosclerosis burden (IMT and AACs), higher 
      percentage of global glomerulosclerois, GBM thickness, arteriolosclerosis and 
      interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy. RRI directly correlated with age (rs = 0.55, 
      p < 0.001) and with all the studied atherosclerosis markers (clinical 
      atherosclerosis score rs = 0.50, p = 0.02; AACs rs = 0.50, p < 0.01; IMT rs = 0.34, 
      p = 0.02). Also, global glomerulosclerosis (rs = 0.31, p = 0.03) and interstitial 
      fibrosis/tubular atrophy (rs = 0.35, p = 0.01) were directly correlated with RRI. In 
      multivariable adjusted binomial logistic regression models, only arteriolosclerosis 
      was retained as independent predictor of RRI >0.7. Conclusion: The analysis of RRI 
      may be useful in the evaluation of the general vascular condition of the patient 
      with CKD, supplying information about both microvascular and macrovascular 
      impairment. Moreover, RRI correlates well with renal histopathologic 
      characteristics, particularly with arteriolosclerosis.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacl.2018.02.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) develop 
      significant vascular calcification early in life, the cause of which is not yet 
      fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney disease have similar vascular 
      calcification, with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in these 
      patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between 
      patients with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether there is a 
      correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and 
      carotid intima-media thickness in patients with HoFH. METHODS: The study was a 
      cross-sectional review involving 30 patients with HoFH attending the Charlotte 
      Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital Lipid Clinic in Parktown, South Africa, as 
      well as 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. FGF23, fasting lipid profiles, 
      calcium, and phosphate were measured. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries 
      was done to assess the extent and severity of arterial calcification. RESULTS: There 
      was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient and control groups 
      (62.07 ± 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 ± 19.84 pg/mL; P = .4621) nor was there any 
      correlation between FGF23 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .9483 and 
      .8474) or total cholesterol (P = .9261 and .859). In the HoFH patients, FGF23 did 
      not correlate significantly with any cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum 
      FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when compared to non-familial 
      hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched controls, and there is no correlation 
      between serum FGF23 and cardiovascular disease in patients with HoFH. FGF23 does not 
      appear to be a major factor for arterial calcification in HoFH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link 
      between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate 
      the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD 
      patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured 
      using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define 
      the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into 
      tertiles. RESULTS: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high 
      arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure 
      (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender 
      (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone 
      (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV 
      value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing 
      tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, 
      respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum 
      calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; 
      OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with 
      cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). 
      CONCLUSION: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central 
      arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have 
      greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification in the Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil).
PG  - 1309-1315
LID - 10.1002/clc.22829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health concern due to the 
      increased prevalence the high fatalities related to heart disease in this 
      population. Among novel cardiovascular risk markers, the coronary artery 
      calcification score (CAC) emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular 
      events. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to test if glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria 
      are independently associated with coronary calcification. METHODS: The Brazilian 
      Longitudinal Study of Adult Health is a cohort of men and women aged 35 to 74 years 
      old addressing cardiovascular diseases. We analyzed the association of CAC, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) 
      according to stages of eGFR (1 = ≥90; 2 = 60-89; 3 = <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ), and ACR 
      (<30; 30 to 300; >300 mg/g). These associations were estimated by logistic 
      regression with a model including age, sex, race, income, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors. RESULTS: Among 4189 persons (median age = 51 years, 54% women), 1183 had 
      CAC. The odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in the 
      multivariate model was 0.86 (0.58-1.29) for the category of eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 
      m(2) compared to people with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73m(2) . On the other hand, the OR 
      (95% CI) for individuals with ACR >300 mg/g was 4.31 (1.27-14.64) compared to people 
      with ACR <30 mg/g. A discrete interaction factor for the association with CAC 
      between eGFR and ACR were analyzed as continuous variable. CONCLUSIONS: Albuminuria 
      was independently associated with coronary calcification, but the reduction of the 
      glomerular filtration rate was not associated with CAC score in this sample of 
      apparently healthy adults.

TI  - Relationship of Serum Soluble Klotho Levels and Echocardiographic Parameters in 
      Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis.
PG  - 396-404
LID - 10.1159/000499200 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
      in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Uremic cardiomyopathy, characterized by 
      myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, has a significant contribution to these adverse 
      cardiac outcomes. The protective effect of soluble Klotho (s-Klotho) on myocardial 
      damage was demonstrated in in vitro and animal experiments. However, data from MHD 
      patients is limited. The present study was designed to identify potential 
      correlations between echocardiographic parameters and serum s-Klotho levels in MHD 
      patients. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 105 MHD patients from 
      the Dialysis Center of Capital Medical University affiliated Beijing Friendship 
      Hospital between March and October 2014. The general information for each patient 
      was recorded. Fasting blood samples were collected prior to hemodialysis during the 
      mid-week session in all patients. The echocardiogram and left lateral lumbar spine 
      radiograph were performed after the same mid-week session. The dialysis records for 
      each session within 3 months before the blood tests were documented. According to 
      the quartiles of s-Klotho levels, patients were divided into four groups (Group 
      1-4). The demographic and clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, 
      and abdominal aortic calcification scores among the groups were compared. RESULTS: 
      The enrolled 105 patients were predominantly male (54.3%) with an average age of 
      59.9 ± 11.2 years. Previous hemodialysis durations were 76 (42-133) months. Sixteen 
      (15.2%) patients had diabetes mellitus. Mean serum s-Klotho level was 411.83 ± 
      152.95 pg/mL, and the 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile values 
      of serum s-Klotho levels were 298.9, 412, and 498.2 pg/mL, respectively. Individuals 
      in the bottom quartile of s-Klotho levels (Group 1) had significantly increased 
      interventricular septal thickness (IVST) compared to those in the other three 
      quartiles of s-Klotho levels (Group 1: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm; vs. Group 2: 1.12 ± 0.16 cm, 
      p = 0.008; vs. Group 3: 0.94 ± 0.13 cm, p < 0.001; vs. Group 4: 1.03 ± 0.1 5 cm, p = 
      0.022). There were significant differences in the ratios of IVST and posterior wall 
      thickness (PWT) between patients of Group 1 and Group 3 (1.12 ± 0.1 2 vs. 1.00 ± 0.1 
      4, p = 0.004). No significant differences were found for other parameters among the 
      groups. The univariate correlation analyses showed that gender (r = -0.211, p = 
      0.030), Kt/V urea (r = -0.240, p = 0.014), hypersensitive C reactive protein 
      (hs-CRP) (r = 0.196, p = 0.045), and serum s-Klotho levels (r = -0.260, p = 0.007) 
      significantly correlated with IVST. Ultimately, only hs-CRP and serum s-Klotho 
      levels were entered into a multiple regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The present study 
      showed that patients with lower circulating s-Klotho levels were more often 
      associated with larger IVST and greater ratios of IVST and PWT. There was an 
      independent association between s-Klotho and IVST, and lower s-Klotho levels seem to 
      be a potential risk factor of uremic cardiomyopathy in MHD patients.

      disease.
PG  - 111-119
LID - 10.1007/s40620-018-0556-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Proteomic profiling of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients could 
      lead to improved risk prediction and novel insights into cardiovascular disease 
      mechanisms. Plasma levels of 92 cardiovascular disease-associated proteins were 
      assessed by proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD-1, Olink Bioscience, 
      Uppsala, Sweden) in a discovery cohort of dialysis patients, the Mapping of 
      Inflammatory Markers in Chronic Kidney disease cohort [MIMICK; n = 183, 55% women, 
      mean age 63 years, 46 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up (mean 43 months)]. 
      Significant results were replicated in the incident and prevalent hemodialysis arm 
      of the Salford Kidney Study [SKS dialysis study, n = 186, 73% women, mean age 
      62 years, 45 cardiovascular deaths during follow-up (mean 12 months)], and in the 
      CKD5-LD-RTxcohort with assessments of coronary artery calcium (CAC)-score by cardiac 
      computed tomography (n = 89, 37% women, mean age 46 years). RESULTS: In age and 
      sex-adjusted Cox regression in MIMICK, 11 plasma proteins were nominally associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality (in order of significance: Kidney injury molecule-1 
      (KIM-1), Matrix metalloproteinase-7, Tumour necrosis factor receptor 2, 
      Interleukin-6, Matrix metalloproteinase-1, Brain-natriuretic peptide, ST2 protein, 
      Hepatocyte growth factor, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor-2, 
      Spondin-1, and Fibroblast growth factor 25). Only plasma KIM-1 was associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality after correction for multiple testing, but also after 
      adjustment for dialysis vintage, cardiovascular risk factors and inflammation 
      (hazard ratio) per standard deviation (SD) increase 1.84, 95% CI 1.26-2.69, 
      p = 0.002. Addition of KIM-1, or nine of the most informative proteins to an 
      established risk-score (modified AROii CVM-score) improved discrimination of 
      cardiovascular mortality risk from C = 0.777 to C = 0.799 and C = 0.823, 
      respectively. In the SKS dialysis study, KIM-1 predicted cardiovascular mortality in 
      age and sex adjusted models (hazard ratio per SD increase 1.45, 95% CI 1.03-2.05, 
      p = 0.034) and higher KIM-1 was associated with higher CACscores in the 
      CKD5-LD-RTx-cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our proteomics approach identified plasma KIM-1 as 
      a risk marker for cardiovascular mortality and coronary artery calcification in 
      three independent ESRD-cohorts. The improved risk prediction for cardiovascular 
      mortality by plasma proteomics merit further studies.

TI  - Association of serum phosphorus and calcium x phosphate product with mortality risk 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients: a national study.
PG  - 607-17
AB  - Elevated serum phosphorus is a predictable accompaniment of end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD) in the absence of dietary phosphate restriction or supplemental phosphate 
      binders. The consequences of hyperphosphatemia include the development and 
      progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism and a predisposition to metastatic 
      calcification when the product of serum calcium and phosphorus (Ca x PO4) is 
      elevated. Both of these conditions may contribute to the substantial morbidity and 
      mortality seen in patients with ESRD. We have analyzed the distribution of serum 
      phosphorus in two large national, random, cross-sectional samples of hemodialysis 
      patients who have been receiving dialysis for at least 1 year. Data were obtained 
      from two special studies of the United States Renal Data System, the Case Mix 
      Adequacy Study (1990) and the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 1 (1993). 
      The relative risk of death by serum phosphorus quintiles is described after 
      adjusting for age at onset of ESRD, race, sex, smoking status, and the presence of 
      diabetes, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and/or neoplasm. Logistic 
      regression analysis is then used to describe the demographic, comorbid, and 
      laboratory parameters associated with high serum phosphorus. Serum phosphorus was 
      similar in these two study populations and averaged 6.2 mg/dL. Ten percent of 
      patients had levels greater than 9 mg/dL and at least 30% of each group had serum 
      phosphorus levels greater than 7 mg/dL. The adjusted relative risk of death by serum 
      phosphorus level was not uniform across all quintiles, being constant below a level 
      of 6.5 mg/dL and increasing significantly above this level. The relative risk of 
      death for those with a serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL was 1.27 relative to 
      those with a serum phosphorus of 2.4 to 6.5 mg/dL. This increased risk was not 
      diminished by statistical adjustment for coexisting medical conditions, delivered 
      dose of dialysis, nutritional parameters, or markers of noncompliance. Evaluation of 
      predictors of serum phosphorus greater than 6.5 mg/dL revealed in multivariate 
      analysis that younger age at onset of ESRD, female sex, white race, diabetes, active 
      smoking, and higher serum creatinine levels were all significant predictors. 
      Analysis of serum calcium revealed no correlation with relative risk of death. The 
      Ca x PO4 product, however, showed a mortality risk trend similar to that seen with 
      serum phosphorus alone. Those in the highest quintile of the Ca x PO4 product (>72 
      mg2/dL2) had a relative mortality risk of 1.34 relative to those with products of 42 
      to 52 mg2/dL2. The relative mortality risk by log parathyroid hormone (PTH) level 
      was elevated for patients with higher levels, but the mortality risk associated with 
      hyperphosphatemia was independent of PTH. For hemodialysis patients who have been 
      receiving dialysis for at least 1 year, we conclude that a large percentage have a 
      serum phosphorus level above 6.5 mg/dL and that this places them at increased risk 
      of death. This increased risk is independent of PTH. The mechanism(s) responsible 
      for death is unknown, but may be related to an abnormally high Ca x PO4 product. 
      Although mechanisms are not clearly established, this study supports the need for 
      vigorous control of hyperphosphatemia to improve patient survival.

TI  - Bone fracture risk factors in prevalent hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 205-212
LID - 10.1007/s00774-019-01041-9 [doi]
AB  - Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of fractures in a 
      cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with possible risk 
      factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 patients, since they started 
      HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters as well 
      as vascular calcifications (VC) were evaluated. Fifty-seven episodes of fracture 
      were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months (incidence rate of 31 per 1000 
      person-years). Age (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.02), 
      and higher VC score (p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of 
      fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p = 0.03) was associated with decreased 
      risk. A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with 
      higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) (p = 0.01) and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either < 300 pg/mL (p = 0.02) or > 800 pg/mL 
      (p < 0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. In conclusion, bone fracture incidence in 
      HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, lower serum 
      albumin, and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high 
      iPTH levels or increased bALP also had a higher fracture risk. Therapy with active 
      vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and 
      management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.

      hemodialysis patients].

LID - S0003-3928(20)30004-4 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been 
      established as an important marker for cardiovascular morbidity, very few studies 
      have studied it in end-stage renal disease patients. Thus we examined and evaluate 
      risk factors of calcification changes in dialysis patients. METHOD: Among 28 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients, CAC was measured in Agatston units at baseline and after 
      five years using the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT. The HD patients were classified 
      as progressors or no progressors according to the change in the CAC score across 
      these 2 measurements. RESULTS: Over an average 63 months follow-up, participants 
      without CAC at baseline had no incident CAC. The progression of CAC was slow and was 
      found only in 6 patients (21.4%). It was significantly associated with several 
      cardiovascular risk factors, namely, older age (P=0.03), diabetes (P=0.05), male sex 
      (P=0.02), hypercholesterolemia (P=0.05), anemia (P=0.017), inflammation (P=0.05), 
      and hyperphosphataemia (P=0.012). However, calcemia, parathormone levels, dialysis 
      duration, tobacco, high blood pressure and dialysis dose did not seem to influence 
      the progression of CAC in our series. A strong association was found between basal 
      calcification scores and Delta increment at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests 
      that CAC progression in dialysis is a complex phenomenon, associated with several 
      risk factors with special regard to elevated basal scores. This progression can be 
      avoided or slowed with appropriate management, which must begin in the early stages 
      of chronic kidney disease.

TI  - Association between coronary tortuosity and mitral annular calcification.
PG  - 75-78
LID - 10.5830/CVJA-2018-068 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary tortuosity (CorT) is a common coronary angiographic finding. 
      The aetiology, clinical implication and long-term prognosis are not well clarified. 
      Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is one of the most common cardiac structural 
      abnormalities on echocardiographic examination. MAC and CorT are associated with 
      atherosclerotic risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
      hypercholesterolaemia, female gender and chronic kidney disease. There are few data 
      on the co-existence of MAC and CorT in the literature. This study was conducted with 
      the aim of evaluating the association between CorT and MAC. METHODS: The medical 
      records of consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography were 
      retrospectively reviewed. The study group consisted of 2 736 patients. Taking into 
      consideration the inclusion criteria, 392 patients with MAC and 687 patients without 
      MAC (control group) were included in the study. Biochemical, clinical and 
      echocardiographic parameters and CorT were evaluated in all patients. CorT was 
      defined as three fixed bends during both systole and diastole, with the angle of 
      each bend 45° or more. RESULTS: Patients with MAC had a higher prevalence of 
      hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, female gender, MAC and advanced age. On univariate 
      analysis, advanced age, hypertension, female gender, hyperlipidaemia and MAC were 
      associated with CorT. On multivariate analysis MAC, advanced age and hypertension 
      were independent predictors for CorT (OR 2.167, 95% CI: 1.436-4.283, p < 0.001; OR 
      1.243, 95% CI: 1.243-3.674, p < 0.001; OR 2.358, 95% CI: 1.864-4.681, p < 0.001, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found a significant relationship 
      between MAC and CorT.

TI  - Vascular calcification in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous 
      pancreas-kidney transplantation.
PG  - 275-81
LID - 10.1111/nep.12212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) 
      has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD 
      artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients 
      undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD. METHODS: Laboratory testing 
      was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) 
      transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral 
      abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale. 
      RESULTS: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their 
      median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months 
      (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with 
      the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence 
      of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate 
      analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer 
      dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). 
      In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, 
      presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, 
      and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. CONCLUSION: VC 
      is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older 
      patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. 
      However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association 
      of VC to BMD.

TI  - Aortic calcification burden predicts deterioration of renal function after radical 
      nephrectomy.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12894-017-0202-x [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a risk factor for 
      the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the possibility of 
      postoperative deterioration of renal function must be considered before surgery. We 
      investigated the contribution of the aortic calcification index (ACI) to the 
      prediction of deterioration of renal function in patients undergoing radical 
      nephrectomy. METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2012, we performed 511 
      consecutive radical nephrectomies for patients with RCC. We retrospectively studied 
      data from 109 patients who had regular postoperative follow-up of renal function for 
      at least five years. The patients were divided into non-CKD and pre-CKD based on a 
      preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or 
      <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. The ACI was quantitatively measured by abdominal 
      computed tomography before surgery. The patients in each group were stratified 
      between low and high ACIs. Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, and pre- and 
      postoperative renal function were compared between patients with a low or high ACI 
      in each group. Renal function deterioration-free interval rates were evaluated by 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. Factors independently associated with deterioration of renal 
      function were determined using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median age, 
      preoperative eGFR, and ACI in this cohort were 65 years, 68 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 
      8.3%, respectively. Higher ACI (≥8.3%) was significantly associated with eGFR 
      decline in both non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Renal function deterioration-free 
      interval rates were significantly lower in the ACI-high than ACI-low strata in both 
      of the non-CKD and pre-CKD groups. Multivariate analysis showed that higher ACI was 
      an independent risk factor for deterioration of renal function at 5 years after 
      radical nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic calcification burden is a potential 
      predictor of deterioration of renal function after radical nephrectomy. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN000023577.

PG  - 950-960
LID - 10.1159/000501687 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this population. 
      The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic calcification volume 
      (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 
      a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD 
      stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective observational study. At study 
      entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, 
      haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: 
      The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 
      m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 
      patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only 
      statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male 
      gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 
      0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently 
      associated with AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the 
      presence nor the extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change 
      in GFR during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 
      and 4, only age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not 
      associated with the rate of decline in GFR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney-related unknown vascular injuries are rare and usually diagnosed 
      only after reperfusion. Hemorrhage that makes in situ reconstruction impossible can 
      lead to graft loss. In an era of organ shortage and an increasing number of patients 
      on the waiting list for transplantation, a kidney graft salvage procedure consisting 
      of graft nephrectomy, reperfusion, reconstruction, and reimplantation should be 
      undertaken whenever possible as a contribution to extending the organs available for 
      transplantation. METHODS AND PATIENTS: From January 2010 to December 2015, in total 
      five patients suffered from intraoperative or immediate postoperative vascular 
      complication and were included for this retrospective analysis. Age, sex, etiology 
      of kidney failure, delayed graft function, kind of vascular complications and 
      therapy, presence of aortoiliac calcification, cold and warm ischemia time, and 
      length of hospital stay were analyzed. RESULTS: By applying this "one-step-back" 
      procedure in three consecutive patients and a structured in situ repair in two 
      patients, all grafts were saved. Two of five patients developed delayed graft 
      function requiring hemodialysis. At discharge, graft function was excellent in all 
      five patients. Reconstructed vasculature showed 100% patency. CONCLUSION: These 
      graft salvage strategies are safe with excellent outcome and should be considered in 
      the event of an acute vascular complication during kidney transplantation.

TI  - Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial calcification score in 
      type 2 diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is 
      associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest that 
      metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, metformin's 
      effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been characterized. The 
      present study investigated the association between metformin use and lower-limb 
      arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular 
      risk. METHODS: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with 
      type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee 
      calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by colour 
      duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully collected from 
      the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. Biochemical and 
      clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors. RESULTS: 
      Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification score than 
      metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 4684 ± 9291, 
      respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated 
      with a significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial 
      calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the use of other 
      antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like 
      peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the 
      association between metformin use and calcification score (odds ratio [95% 
      confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, 
      tobacco use, renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, 
      neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA(1c) levels, and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently associated with a lower 
      below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This association may contribute to 
      metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective 
      investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in patients with and 
      without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these results.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of coronary microvascular dysfunction among chest 
      pain patients in the emergency department.
PG  - 5-13
LID - 10.1177/2048872618764418 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is common in patients with 
      non-obstructive coronary arteries but has not been described in low-risk symptomatic 
      patients. We therefore assessed the prevalence and characteristics of CMD in low to 
      moderate risk patients with chest pain in an emergency department. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We used three-dimensional Rb(82) cardiac positron emission 
      tomography/computed tomography to diagnose coronary artery disease (known or new 
      regional defect, any coronary calcification) and CMD (low coronary flow reserve 
      without coronary artery disease) in chest pain patients after being ruled out for 
      acute myocardial infarction. Exclusions included age 30 years or less, acute 
      myocardial infarction, hemodynamic instability, heart failure and dialysis. Among 
      195 participants undergoing cardiac positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography, 42% had CMD, 36% had coronary artery disease and 22% had normal flows; 
      70% were women and 84% were obese. Patients with CMD and coronary artery disease had 
      significantly lower coronary flow reserve than normal patients (mean coronary flow 
      reserve 1.6 and 1.9 vs. 2.6, respectively, P<0.05). However, CMD patients were 
      younger (mean age 51 vs. 61 years), and had fewer traditional cardiac risk factors 
      (P<0.05) than patients with coronary artery disease. Nearly one third (31%) of 
      patients had a prior emergency department visit for chest pain within three years of 
      index presentation. Women were four times as likely to have CMD as men (adjusted 
      odds ratio 4.2; 95% confidence interval 1.8, 9.6) after controlling for age, race, 
      hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity and family history of 
      coronary artery disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their low-risk profile, nearly one 
      half of symptomatic and mostly obese emergency department patients without evidence 
      of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease had CMD. The results could 
      explain the high rates of return visits associated with chest pain, although their 
      application to the general emergency department population require validation.

TI  - Skin autofluorescence associates with vascular calcification in chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1784-90
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between tissue advanced 
      glycation end products, as reflected by skin autofluorescence, and vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Three hundred 
      patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease underwent multislice computed 
      tomography to estimate total coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and had tissue 
      advanced glycation end product assessed using a skin autofluorescence reader. Intact 
      parathyroid hormone (P<0.001) displaced estimated glomerular filtration rate as 
      third most significant factor associated with skin autofluorescence after age 
      (P<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (P<0.001) in multiple regression analysis. On 
      univariate multinomial logistic regression analysis, every 1-U increase in skin 
      autofluorescence was associated with a 7.43-fold (95% confidence intervals, 
      3.59-15.37; P<0.001) increased odds of having CACS ≥400 compared with those with 
      zero CACS. Skin autofluorescence retained significance in predicting CACS ≥400 (odds 
      ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence intervals, 1.44-9.18; P=0.006) when adjusting for age, 
      sex, serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, C-reactive protein, lipids, blood pressure, 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate, and intact parathyroid hormone but marginally 
      lost significance when additionally adjusting for diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 
      2.23; 95% confidence intervals, 0.81-6.14; P=0.1). Combination of diabetes mellitus 
      and higher intact parathyroid hormone was associated with greater skin 
      autofluorescence and CACS versus those without diabetes mellitus and having lower 
      intact parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue advanced glycation end product, as 
      reflected by skin autofluorescence, showed a significant novel association with 
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. These data suggest that increased 
      tissue advanced glycation end product may contribute to vascular calcification in 
      chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and warrant further experimental 
      investigation.

TI  - Impact of pretransplant mitral annular calcification on the incidence of cardiac 
      events after renal transplantation.
PG  - 526-533
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfz063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with increased risk of 
      major adverse cardiac events. We hypothesized that MAC, identified on a 
      pretransplant transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), is predictive of cardiac events 
      following renal transplantation (RT). METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 
      consecutive RT recipients, pretransplant MAC presence and severity were determined 
      on TTE performed within 1 year prior to transplant. MAC severity was quantified 
      based on the circumferential MAC extension relative to the mitral valve annulus. 
      Post-transplant cardiac risk was assessed using the sum of risk factors (range: 0-8) 
      set forth by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 
      Foundation consensus statement on the assessment of RT candidates. Subjects 
      underwent pretransplant stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial 
      perfusion imaging and followed for post-transplant composite outcome of cardiac 
      death or myocardial infarction (CD/MI). RESULTS: Among 336 subjects (60.5% men; mean 
      age 52 ± 12 years), MAC was present in 78 (23%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 
      3.1 ± 1.9 years, a total of 70 events were observed. Patients with MAC had a higher 
      event rate compared with those without MAC (34.6% versus 17.8%, log-rank P = 0.001). 
      There was a stepwise increase in CD/MI risk with increasing MAC severity (P for 
      trend = 0.002). MAC-associated risk remained significant after adjusting for sex, 
      duration of dialysis, sum of risk factors, ejection fraction and perfusion 
      abnormality burden, providing an incremental prognostic value to these parameters 
      (Δχ2 =4.63; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Among RT recipients, the burden of pretransplant 
      MAC is an independent predictor of post-transplant risk of CD/MI. MAC should be 
      considered in the preoperative assessment of RT candidates.

TI  - Study of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders in newly detected advanced 
      renal failure patients: A Hospital-based cross-sectional study.
PG  - 874-885
AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone 
      mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected, untreated 
      predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a tertiary care 
      hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational study. A total of 95 
      (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent clinical evaluation, 
      biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
      albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25- hydroxyvitamin D 
      (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any abnormality including 
      fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular calcification (CVC)]. 
      Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 33.6% of the study 
      patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and 
      hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. CVC was seen in 
      22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly involving the mitral valve. Patients 
      with CVC were more likely to be males and smokers. There was no significant 
      difference in iPTH levels between patients with or without CVC. AAC was seen in 
      10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray. Patients with AAC had higher levels of 
      iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels of calcium compared to patients without 
      AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in 41.05% of our patients and was more 
      prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 
      25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that newly detected, naïve Indian CKD patients have 
      a high prevalence of disturbances of mineral metabolism including 
      hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, abnormal BMD, and valvular and vascular 
      calcification, even before initiating dialysis.

TI  - Comparison of Solute Clearance, Hospitalization Rate, and Aortic Arch Calcification 
      between Online Hemodiafiltration and High-Flux Hemodialysis: A 6-Year Observational 
      Study.
PG  - 264-276
LID - 10.1159/000499645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Studies on the long-term clinical benefits of hemodiafiltration 
      (HDF) and high-flux hemodialysis (HFHD) are very limited. This study aimed to 
      investigate the hospitalization rate and aortic arch calcification (AAC) of these 
      two dialysis modalities over 6 years. METHODS: Participants who received regular HDF 
      and HFHD in one hospital-facilitated hemodialysis center were prospectively enrolled 
      after matching for age, sex, and diabetes between January 2009 and December 2014. 
      Medical records were reviewed retrospectively on demographics, laboratory variables, 
      calcified scores in aortic arch measured by chest radiography, and rates of hospital 
      admission. Cox proportional hazard regression and linear regression were used to 
      obtain the outcome results. RESULTS: The HDF and HFHD groups consisted of 108 and 
      102 participants, respectively. Levels of laboratory variables including small 
      soluble solutes and Kt/V were not statistically different over the 6-year period 
      between the HDF and HFHD groups. Calcified scores of the aortic arch increased over 
      6 years in both groups. The changes in the mean calcified scores were significant 
      when compared between the two groups (0.44-1.82 in HFHD, 0.79-1.8 in HDF, 
      respectively, p = 0.008). Hospitalization rates were 735 per 1,000 patients in the 
      HDF group and 852 per 1,000 patients in the HFHD group, respectively. No significant 
      difference was observed in frequency and days of hospitalization between HDF and 
      HFHD. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates and AAC were observed to be equal for HDF 
      and HFHD.

PG  - 239-48
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2014070670 [doi]
AB  - Calciprotein particle maturation time (T50) in serum is a novel measure of 
      individual blood calcification propensity. To determine the clinical relevance of 
      T50 in renal transplantation, baseline serum T50 was measured in a longitudinal 
      cohort of 699 stable renal transplant recipients and the associations of T50 with 
      mortality and graft failure were analyzed over a median follow-up of 3.1 years. 
      Predictive value of T50 was assessed for patient survival with reference to 
      traditional (Framingham) risk factors and the calcium-phosphate product. Serum 
      magnesium, bicarbonate, albumin, and phosphate levels were the main determinants of 
      T50, which was independent of renal function and dialysis vintage before transplant. 
      During follow-up, 81 (12%) patients died, of which 38 (47%) died from cardiovascular 
      causes. Furthermore, 45 (6%) patients developed graft failure. In fully adjusted 
      models, lower T50 values were independently associated with increased all-cause 
      mortality (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.85; P=0.006 per SD 
      decrease) and increased cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.04 to 2.29; P=0.03 per SD decrease). In addition to age, sex, and eGFR, 
      T50 improved prognostication for all-cause mortality, whereas traditional risk 
      factors or calcium-phosphate product did not. Lower T50 was also associated with 
      increased graft failure risk. The associations of T50 with mortality and graft 
      failure were confirmed in an independent replication cohort. In conclusion, reduced 
      serum T50 was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
      mortality, and graft failure and, of all tested parameters, displayed the strongest 
      association with all-cause mortality in these transplant recipients.

TI  - Predictors of atherosclerotic events in patients on haemodialysis: post hoc analyses 
      from the AURORA study.
PG  - 102-112

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on haemodialysis (HD) are at high risk for cardiovascular 
      events, but heart failure and sudden death are more common than atherosclerotic 
      events. The A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatinin in Subjects on Regular 
      Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) trial was 
      designed to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial infarction and death 
      from any cardiac cause in 2773 HD patients. We studied predictors of the 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in AURORA. METHODS: We readjudicated all 
      deaths and presumed myocardial infarctions according to the criteria used in the 
      Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP); these were specifically developed to 
      separate atherosclerotic from non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. The 
      readjudicated atherosclerotic end point included the first event of the following: 
      non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal and fatal 
      non-haemorrhagic stroke, coronary revascularization procedures and death from 
      ischaemic limb disease. Stepwise Cox regression analysis was used to identify the 
      predictors of such events. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, 506 
      patients experienced the new composite atherosclerotic outcome. Age, male sex, 
      prevalent diabetes, prior cardiovascular disease, weekly dialysis duration, baseline 
      albumin [hazard ratio (HR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99 per g/L 
      increase], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.04-1.22 per mg/L 
      increase) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HR 1.09; 95% CI 
      1.03-1.17 per 10 U/L increase) were selected as significant predictors in the model. 
      Neither LDL cholesterol nor allocation to placebo/rosuvastatin therapy predicted the 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the use of strict criteria for end point definition, 
      non-traditional risk factors, but not lipid disturbances, predicted atherosclerotic 
      events in HD patients.

TI  - Plasma biomarkers improve prediction of diabetic kidney disease in adults with type 
      1 diabetes over a 12-year follow-up: CACTI study.
PG  - 1189-1196
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfx255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to determine whether plasma biomarkers of 
      kidney injury improve the prediction of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in adults with 
      type 1 diabetes (T1D) over a period of 12 years. METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% 
      females) in the Coronary Artery Calcification in T1D (CACTI) Study were examined 
      during 2002-04, at a mean (± standard deviation) age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years with 
      24.8 years as the median duration of diabetes. Urine albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) and 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by CKD-EPI (chronic kidney disease 
      epidemiology collaboration) creatinine were measured at the baseline and after mean 
      follow-up of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Albuminuria was defined as ACR ≥30 mg/g and impaired 
      GFR as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Kidney injury biomarkers (Meso Scale Diagnostics) 
      were measured on stored baseline plasma samples. A principal component analysis 
      (PCA) identified two components: (i) kidney injury molecule-1, calbindin, 
      osteoactivin, trefoil factor 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor; and (ii) β-2 
      microglobulin, cystatin C, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and 
      osteopontin that were used in the multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      Component 2 of the PCA was associated with increase in log modulus ACR [β ± standard 
      error (SE): 0.16 ± 0.07, P = 0.02] and eGFR (β ± SE: -2.56 ± 0.97, P = 0.009) over a 
      period of 12 years after adjusting for traditional risk factors (age, sex, HbA1c, 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure and baseline 
      eGFR/baseline ACR). Only Component 2 of the PCA was associated with 
      incident-impaired GFR (odds ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.18-3.67, 
      P = 0.01), adjusting for traditional risk factors. The addition of Component 2 to 
      traditional risk factors significantly improved C-statistics and 
      net-reclassification improvement for incident-impaired GFR (ΔAUC: 0.02 ± 0.01, 
      P = 0.049, and 29% non-events correctly reclassified, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Plasma kidney injury biomarkers can help predict development of DKD in T1D.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and carotid atherosclerosis.
PG  - 47-51
LID - 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2010.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The 
      association between carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and chronic kidney disease 
      is controversial, however. In addition, whether renal dysfunction promotes vascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease is not clear. The study 
      subjects were 1003 patients aged ≥50 years who underwent carotid ultrasonography in 
      our hospital. Kidney function was evaluated based on the estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Patients with end-stage 
      renal failure were excluded. We measured the mean max-IMT (which indicates mean 
      maximal wall thickness) at 12 carotid segments, and examined the characteristics of 
      the maximal plaques by carotid ultrasonography. We evaluated the association between 
      mean max-IMT and eGFR, and also evaluated the clinical factors associated with mean 
      max-IMT and calcification of the maximal plaques. We found that eGFR was 
      significantly correlated with mean max-IMT. Reduced eGFR, proteinuria, age, male 
      sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking were independently 
      associated with mean max-IMT in multiple regression analysis. Kidney function was 
      not associated with calcified plaque. Kidney dysfunction was associated with carotid 
      atherosclerosis in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and associated 
      factors of carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 309 panoramic 
      radiographs of patients with CKD (180 men and 129 women; mean age 43.7 years) 
      undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated by a single radiologist to determine the 
      frequency of CAC. An analysis of associated factors, such as age, sex, time spent in 
      hemodialysis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, biochemical parameters, and 
      other systemic diseases, was also performed. RESULTS: The presence of CAC in 
      patients with CKD, as determined on the basis of panoramic radiography, was 15.9%. 
      The χ(2) test revealed that there was a statistically significant association 
      between certain factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus, and the presence 
      of CAC (P < .05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that time spent in hemodialysis 
      was significantly associated with the occurrence of CAC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant 
      presence of CAC was detected on digital panoramic radiographs in patients with CKD 
      undergoing hemodialysis. Calcification was more frequent in older patients, women, 
      individuals with diabetes mellitus, and patients who had undergone hemodialysis for 
      longer periods.

TI  - Vascular calcification is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 137-142
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1740-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) in hemodialysis (HD) patients is a sign of 
      severe cardiovascular disease and can predict cardiovascular outcomes. Fetuin-A and 
      osteopontin (OPN) inhibit VC. Serum fetuin-A levels are lower in patients with 
      end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and in those who are on chronic HD therapy. However, 
      there are limited data concerning OPN in patients who are on dialysis. The aim of 
      our study was to determine VC in HD patients, the relationship between VC and 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, and OPN levels, and independent predictors of VC. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three patients with ESKD on HD therapy were recruited. 
      Among these patients, 44 were male and 49 were female. The patient group was 
      compared with a group of 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex. A plain 
      radiograph of the hand was taken using a mammography machine for the evaluation of 
      VC. Serum fetuin-A, OPN, and 25-OH-vitamin D levels of both patients and controls 
      were measured. RESULTS: VC was detected in 45 (48.4%) HD patients. When patients 
      were compared with healthy controls, fetuin-A levels (p < 0.029) were significantly 
      lower in patients, whereas OPN (p < 0.000) and VC (p < 0.002) were significantly 
      higher in the patient group. Age [odds ratio (OR) 1.036], the presence of diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) (OR 17.527), and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (OR 1.002) were 
      independent predictors of VC in a logistic regression model including the following 
      factors: age, the presence of DM, HD duration, and serum albumin, phosphate, PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, fetuin-A, OPN, and calcium levels. No significant correlation was 
      found between patients with VC and patients without VC in terms of fetuin-A, OPN, 
      and 25-OH-vitamin D levels. CONCLUSIONS: VC is a frequent sign in patients 
      undergoing HD and is not related to serum fetuin-A and osteopontin levels. Age, the 
      presence of DM, and high PTH levels were independent predictors of VC in patients 
      undergoing HD. Further studies are warranted to understand the mechanism underlying 
      and the factors contributing to VC.

TI  - Relationships between abdominal aortic calcification, glomerular filtration rate, 
      and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic 
      kidney disease .
PG  - 380-389
LID - 10.5414/CN109441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is an established risk factor for 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized 
      that AAC is associated with a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as 
      with some other cardiovascular risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled clinical 
      trial (RENEXC). A total of 151 patients (aged 66 ± 14 years) with an average 
      measured GFR (mGFR) of 22.5 ± 8.2 mL/min/1.73m2, not on renal replacement therapy, 
      irrespective of number of comorbidities, were included. GFR was measured with 
      iohexol clearance and estimated using cystatin C- and creatinine-based equations 
      (eGFR). AAC was evaluated with lateral lumbar X-ray using the scoring system 
      described by Kauppila. All patients underwent laboratory analyses, 24-hour 
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and standard echocardiography. Multiple linear 
      regression analyses controlling for sex, age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and 
      hypertension were performed. RESULTS: The prevalence of AAC in this group of 
      patients was 73%, and 47% had severe calcification (AAC score ≥ 7). More men (76%) 
      had AAC than women (69%). AAC score was associated with mGFR (p = 0.03), eGFR (p = 
      0.006), plasma albumin (p = 0.006), plasma phosphate (p = 0.01), pulse pressure (p = 
      0.004), left ventricular mass (LVM) (p = 0.02), left atrial volume (LAV; p < 0.001), 
      and left atrial volume index (LAVI; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: AAC was highly prevalent 
      in CKD. The degree of calcification in the abdominal aorta was strongly associated 
      with a decline in GFR, a decrease in plasma albumin, an increase in plasma 
      phosphate, an increase in pulse pressure, and cardiac structural changes, such as an 
      increase in LVM, LAV, and LAVI. .

TI  - Usefulness of pretransplant aortic arch calcification evaluation for kidney 
      transplant outcome prediction in one year follow-up.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2018.1455588 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events and 
      hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We aimed 
      to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict 
      post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its 
      association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in 
      one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 
      kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two 
      radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa 
      et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The mismatching results were 
      repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and 
      carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry 
      before and one year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and 
      cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1 year. We found out that eGFR(1year) 
      correlated with eGFR(discharge) and calcium based on hospital discharge data 
      (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFR(discharge) 
      (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR(1year) than AoAC combined with 
      recipient eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four 
      (10.81%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV 
      ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In 
      conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE 
      rate within 1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray 
      together with recipient eGFR(discharge) could be related to kidney function in 
      one-year follow-up.

TI  - Serum cystatin C levels are associated with coronary artery calcification in women 
      without chronic kidney disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic renal disease (CKD) is a determinant of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), which is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, in a 
      population without CKD, the association between CAC and renal function is unclear. 
      CAC is affected by sex. This study aimed to determine whether serum cystatin C, a 
      sensitive marker of kidney function, or sex differences are associated with CAC in 
      patients without CKD. METHODS: We evaluated 456 consecutive patients (61±13 years, 
      42% women) without CKD and evidence of coronary artery disease. The CAC (Agatston) 
      score was examined by multidetector computed tomography. RESULTS: When patients were 
      categorized into three CAC groups based on the Agatston score, mild (<10), moderate 
      (11-399), and severe (≥400) in each sex, serum cystatin C levels gradually increased 
      by severity of CAC in women, but not men. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis showed that, in women, a cut-off value of 0.97mg/l for cystatin C 
      discriminated patients with severe CAC with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 
      77% (area under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p<0.01). Multivariate logistic 
      analysis showed that serum cystatin C was not associated with severe CAC in all 
      patients and men, but this association was observed in women (OR: 7.80 for cystatin 
      C≥0.97mg/l, 95% CI: 1.76-34.6, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C levels 
      are associated with greater CAC in women without CKD. Measurement of cystatin C may 
      be useful for identifying women who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Epicardial adipose tissue is a predictor of decreased kidney function and coronary

PG  - 979-986
LID - 10.1007/s40618-019-1011-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the association of epicardial and pericardial fat volume (EFV, 
      PFV) with cardiovascular risk factors and kidney function in Native Americans of 
      southwestern heritage with youth and early adult onset type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM) versus healthy controls. METHODS: Using computed tomography, we quantified 
      EFV and PFV in 149 Native Americans (92 women, 57 men), 95 of which had T2DM (38 
      diagnosed prior to age 20 years). Duration of T2DM, mean carotid arterial mass (AM), 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC), IL-6, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      eGFR(cr(CKD-EPI)) were measured. RESULTS: EFV and PFV were associated with BMI 
      (r = 0.37, p < 0.0001; r = 0.26, p = 0.001) and did not differ between onset 
      age-groups and controls (p > 0.05). EFV was associated with AM only in controls 
      (r = 0.51, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for BMI, T2DM duration, HbA1C, age, and 
      sex, EFV was a predictor of CAC and IL-6 concentrations in early adult onset T2DM 
      (β = 0.05 ± 0.02 cm(3), p = 0.03; β = 0.05 ± 0.01 pg/ml/cm(3), p = 0.002). EFV and 
      PFV were independent predictors of reduced eGFR(cr(CKD-EPI)) in the youth onset T2DM 
      group (β = -0.3 ± 0.08 ml/min/cm(3), p = 0.001; β = -0.25 ± 0.05 ml/min/cm(3), 
      p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Epicardial fat volume may be a risk factor for heart 
      disease in individuals with early adult onset T2DM and a predictor of decreased 
      kidney function in individuals with youth onset T2DM.

LID - 861
AB  - Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) detected on lateral vertebral fracture 
      assessment is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Vitamin D deficiency 
      and toxicity have been linked with vascular calcification. The objective of this 
      study was to determine the effect of high-dose vitamin D on the progression of AAC. 
      The Physical Performance, Osteoporosis and vitamin D in African American Women 
      (PODA) is a randomized, clinical trial examining the effect of vitamin D. There were 
      14.7% subjects with AAC in the vitamin D group, compared to 12.1% in the placebo 
      group at baseline. The prevalence of extended AAC at baseline was 6.4% in the 
      vitamin D group and 3.5% in the placebo group. The extended calcification scores 
      over time were not different between groups. There was no association between AAC 
      and serum 25(OH)D. However, PTH was associated with an increase in AAC in the 
      placebo group.

TI  - Visceral Adipose Tissue and Leptin Hyperproduction Are Associated With Hypogonadism 
      in Men With Chronic Kidney Disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypogonadism is a common endocrine disorder in men with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD), but its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We here explore the 
      plausible contribution of abdominal adiposity and leptin hyperproduction to 
      testosterone deficiency in this patient population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis 
      with all men included the Malnutrition, Inflammation and Vascular Calcification 
      cohort, which enrolled consecutive nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3-5. 
      SUBJECTS: A total of 172 men with CKD stages 3-5 nondialysis (median age 61 [45-75] 
      years, median glomerular filtration rate 24 [9-45] mL/min/1.73 m(2)). In them, serum 
      levels of total testosterone, estrogen, sex hormone binding globulin, and leptin 
      were quantified, together with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) by thoracic and 
      abdominal CT scan. INTERVENTION: None, observational study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Total testosterone, hypogonadism. RESULTS: The median level of total testosterone 
      was 11.7 (7.3-18.4) nmol/L, with hypogonadism (<10 nmol/L) present in 52 (30%) 
      patients. Testosterone-deficient patients presented with significantly higher body 
      mass index, waist circumference, and VAT. An inverse correlation between 
      testosterone and VAT (rho = -0.25, P = .001) or waist circumference (rho = -0.20, 
      P = .008) was found, also after multivariate adjustment including sex hormone 
      binding globulin and estrogen. Total testosterone was inversely correlated with 
      serum leptin (rho = -0.22, P = .003), and the ratio of leptin/VAT, an index of 
      leptin hyperproduction, was strongly and independently associated with the 
      prevalence of hypogonadism in multivariable regression analyses. CONCLUSION: 
      Visceral adiposity independently associated with lower testosterone levels among men 
      with CKD stage 3-5 nondialysis. The observed link between hyperleptinemia and 
      hypogonadism is in line with previous evidence on direct effects of leptin on 
      testosterone production.

TI  - Medtronic Freestyle aortic bioprosthesis: a potential option for haemodialysis 
      patients†.
PG  - 459-63; discussion 463-4
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivv388 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: End-stage renal disease patients on regular haemodialysis are at higher 
      risk of calcification. Therefore, many surgeons have concerns regarding the 
      implantation of bioprostheses in such patients. The haemodynamic advantages of 
      stentless aortic bioprostheses support their use; however, these have not been 
      studied yet in end-stage renal disease patients. We studied accordingly the early 
      and mid-term outcomes of aortic valve replacement (AVR) using Medtronic Freestyle 
      stentless aortic bioprostheses in this subset of patients in comparison with stented 
      aortic bioprostheses. METHODS: We retrospectively studied two groups of consecutive 
      patients on regular haemodialysis who required AVR between 2007 and 2013. 
      Non-Freestyle (NFS) group received stented aortic bioprostheses (36 patients) and 
      Freestyle (FS) group received Medtronic Freestyle aortic bioprostheses (48 
      patients). Follow-up ranged from 2 to 76 months with a mean follow-up of 36.3 ± 25 
      months. RESULTS: Patients in both groups showed similar demographic characters 
      regarding age (76.4 ± 8.1 vs 74.9 ± 7.2 years; P = 0.35), male gender (58 vs 60%; P 
      = 0.57) and diabetes mellitus (42 vs 48%; P = 0.57). Smaller aortic bioprostheses 
      were implanted in the NFS (23.3 ± 1.2 vs 25.4 ± 2.1; P < 0.001) with consequently 
      higher postoperative mean gradients (14.1 ± 4.1 vs 11.9 ± 5.3 mmHg; P = 0.004). No 
      significant differences were noted regarding postoperative neurological disorder (8 
      vs 12%; P = 0.73), deep sternal wound infection (3 vs 4%; P = 0.68), re-exploration 
      (8 vs 8%; P = 0.91) and in-hospital mortality (6 vs 4%; P = 0.92). Mid-term 
      follow-up showed higher prosthetic valve calcification and/or sclerosis in NFS group 
      (25 vs 6%; P = 0.015), whereas no significant differences were noticed between the 
      two groups regarding stroke (0 vs 8%; P = 0.13), endocarditis (0 vs 4%; P = 0.50), 
      36- and 72-month survival (51 ± 2%, 14 ± 4% vs 55 ± 2%, 19 ± 3%, respectively; P = 
      0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic bioprostheses are a good option for haemodialysis 
      patients requiring AVR, offering acceptable mid-term survival. The Medtronic 
      Freestyle aortic bioprostheses could allow the implantation of larger bioprostheses 
      inferring consequently lower mean gradients, with a potentially higher resistance to 
      calcification and sclerosis in haemodialysis patients.

TI  - Serum sclerostin levels are positively related to bone mineral density in peritoneal 
      dialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 266
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1452-5 [doi]
LID - 266
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus 
      integration site (Wnt) pathway that regulates bone metabolism, is a potential 
      contributor of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), which 
      has various forms of presentation, from osteoporosis to vascular calcification. The 
      positive association of sclerostin with bone mineral density (BMD) has been 
      demonstrated in CKD and hemodialysis (HD) patients but not in peritoneal dialysis 
      (PD) patients. This study assessed the association between sclerostin and BMD in PD 
      patients. METHODS: Eighty-nine PD patients were enrolled; their sera were collected 
      for measurement of sclerostin and other CKD-MBD-related markers. BMD was also 
      assessed simultaneously. We examined the relationship between sclerostin and each 
      parameter through Spearman correlation analysis and by comparing group data between 
      patients with above- and below-median sclerostin levels. Univariate and multiple 
      logistic regression models were employed to define the most predictive of sclerostin 
      levels in the above-median category. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed that 
      sclerostin was correlated with spine BMD (r = 0.271, P = 0.011), spine BMD T-score 
      (r = 0.274, P = 0.010), spine BMD Z-score (r = 0.237, P = 0.027), and intact 
      parathyroid hormone (PTH; r = - 0.357, P < 0.001) after adjustments for age and sex. 
      High BMD, old age, male sex, increased weight and height, diabetes, and high 
      osteocalcin and uric acid levels were observed in patients with high serum 
      sclerostin levels and an inverse relation was noticed between PTH and sclerostin. 
      Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that BMD is positively 
      correlated with above-median sclerostin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 65.61, P = 0.002); 
      the correlation was retained even after multivariate adjustment (OR = 121.5, 
      P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study demonstrated a positive 
      association between serum sclerostin levels and BMD in the PD population.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1111/nep.12210 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk 
      factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney 
      transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same 
      time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the 
      long-term. METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC 
      was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting 
      list. RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT 
      and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no 
      differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD 
      between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was 
      observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were 
      associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was 
      more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged 
      dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC 
      increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial 
      after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe 
      degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became 
      more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part 
      influenced by past dialysis experience.

TI  - Sclerostin Serum Levels and Vascular Calcification Progression in Prevalent Renal 
      Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 4669-76
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-3056 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal 
      transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt 
      signaling contributes to VC. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether 
      circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of 
      VC. DESIGN: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels 
      Renal Transplant Cohort study. SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care academic 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were 
      measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 
      ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median 
      follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored 
      blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of 
      baseline VC and progression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was 
      progression of VC. RESULTS: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. 
      Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson 
      criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association 
      between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse 
      after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level 
      was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta 
      calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin 
      levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment 
      for traditional risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sclerostin levels inversely 
      associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for 
      traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted 
      chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be 
      up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local 
      counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and 
      experimental data are required for confirmation.

TI  - Comparison of atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with end

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to increased 
      morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The primary underlying 
      mechanism has been suggested as accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Our 
      aim was to compare the atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects 
      with ESRD on hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing 
      fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forthy two subjects who 
      underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively studied. Twenty one were 
      subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis (67±11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 were 
      age- and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) 
      and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, descending, abdominal) and 
      for the common iliac arteries and common femoral arteries were measured. 
      Standardized uptake value maximum and SUVmean for right atrial blood pool were also 
      measured as the background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean, average 
      SUVmax/background ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were compared between 
      subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of macroscopic calcification on 
      CT images for each arterial segment based on visual qualitative assessment was also 
      noted and compared. For statistical analysis, two-sided t-test was used for 
      continuous variables, and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We 
      considered a P value of <0.05 as statistically significant. RESULTS: Average SUVmax 
      and SUVmean were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD than in 
      controls in all arterial segments. Average SUVmax/background ratios were 
      statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal 
      controls in all arterial segments except for the left femoral artery. Average 
      SUVmean/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with 
      ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the right and 
      left femoral arteries. Presence of calcification on CT was more frequently 
      encountered in all arterial segments in subjects with ESRD, and was statistically 
      significantly greater for the aortic arch, descending aorta, and right and left 
      femoral arteries. CONCLUSION: SUV measurements representing the atherosclerotic 
      inflammatory changes and macroscopic atherosclerotic calcifications appear to be 
      accelerated in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to normal controls. 
      Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is a valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying 
      accelerated atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.

TI  - Evaluation of the association of Wnt signaling with coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s12882-019-1543-3 [doi]
LID - 345
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease have a higher risk of death from 
      cardiovascular events, which can be mainly attributed to coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC). Wnt signaling is involved in vascular development and may play 
      a role in vascular calcification. This study aimed to evaluate CAC prevalence in 
      patients on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and identify 
      CAC risk factors. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of the severe 
      hyperparathyroidism registration study that prospectively recruited patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT who were candidates for parathyroidectomy, from October 
      2013 to May 2015. CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured. Demographic and 
      clinical data including calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), and sclerostin levels were 
      analyzed. CAC scores were reported in Agatston units (AU). RESULTS: A total of 61 
      patients were included in this study. No CAC, mild CAC (<100 AU), moderate CAC (>100 
      AU), and severe CAC (>400 AU) were observed in 4.9%, 11.4%, 14.8%, and 68.9% of 
      patients, respectively. DKK1 and sclerostin were not associated with CAC. In 
      univariate analysis, CAC was significantly correlated with age, sex (male), total 
      cholesterol, and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). CAC was not inversely 
      correlated with the BMD, T scores, or Z scores of the femoral neck (p>0.05). In 
      multivariate analysis, the stepwise forward multiple linear regression revealed that 
      CAC was associated with age, male sex and intravenous pulse calcitriol (p<0.05). 
      Furthermore, serum sclerostin was positively correlated with the BMD of the femoral 
      neck but negatively associated with intact parathyroid hormone (p<0.05). Serum 
      sclerostin was significantly associated with severely low bone mass with 
      Z-scores<-2.5 of the femoral neck, even when adjusted for serum intact parathyroid 
      hormone, vitamin D status, dialysis pattern, sex, and DKK-1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The patients on dialysis with severe SHPT have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcification. Although the Wnt signaling pathway could play a role in 
      hyperparathyroid bone disease, CAC may be mainly due to the treatment modality 
      rather than the Wnt signaling pathway associated bone metabolism in patients on 
      dialysis with severe SHPT.

TI  - Inactive Matrix Gla Protein, Arterial Stiffness, and Endothelial Function in African 
      American Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 735-741
LID - 10.1093/ajh/hpy049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vascular calcification inhibitor dependent 
      upon vitamin K for activation. Evidence suggests that elevated plasma inactive MGP 
      levels (desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP, dp-ucMGP; indicating poorer vascular vitamin 
      K status) are associated with greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Despite 
      African Americans experiencing highest rates of kidney failure and CVD events, 
      relationships between dp-ucMGP and CVD risk markers have not been examined in this 
      population. We investigated vascular vitamin K status (via plasma dp-ucMGP) between 
      African American hemodialysis (HD) patients and healthy controls, and the 
      associations of dp-ucMGP with arterial stiffness and endothelial function in HD 
      patients only. METHODS: In 37 African American HD patients and 37 age- and 
      race-matched controls, plasma dp-ucMGP was measured by enzyme immunoassay as a 
      marker of vascular vitamin K status. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV; 
      arterial stiffness measurement) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD; 
      endothelial function measurement) were assessed by applanation tonometry and 
      ultrasound, respectively, in HD patients only. RESULTS: Mean dp-ucMGP levels were 
      5.6 times higher in HD patients vs. controls (2,139 ± 1,102 vs. 382 ± 181 pmol/l, P 
      < 0.01). Multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, dialysis vintage, 
      diabetes mellitus, CVD history, body mass index, and blood pressure, revealed that 
      dp-ucMGP was independently related to PWV (standardized β = 0.49) and FMD 
      (standardized β = -0.53) (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the 
      higher plasma dp-ucMGP concentrations found in African American HD patients may be 
      associated with greater arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction.

TI  - Association between chronic kidney disease and coronary artery calcification: the 
      Dallas Heart Study.
PG  - 507-13
AB  - The hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) was tested using data from the Dallas Heart 
      Study, a representative sample of Dallas County residents aged 30 to 65 yr. CKD was 
      defined as presence of microalbuminuria and GFR > or =60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 
      1 to 2), or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (stage 3 to 5), excluding end-stage kidney 
      disease. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between stages of 
      CKD and CAC scores >10, >100, and >400 versus scores < or =10 compared with no CKD 
      while adjusting for covariates. Analyses were repeated after stratifying by presence 
      of diabetes. The mean age was 43.9 yr, and hypertension and diabetes were noted in 
      31.0 and 9.8%, respectively. No association was noted between stage 1 to 2 CKD and 
      increased CAC scores. Compared with no CKD, stage 3 to 5 CKD was associated with CAC 
      scores >100 (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 8.80) and >400 (odds 
      ratio, 8.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.94 to 35.95) in the total population after 
      adjustment for covariates, but these associations were substantially reduced after 
      exclusion of participants with diabetes. Participants with diabetes and stage 3 to 5 
      CKD had a ninefold increased odds of CAC scores >10 versus scores < or =10 compared 
      with participants with diabetes and without CKD, whereas no association was noted 
      between stage 3 to 5 CKD and CAC scores >10 in the nondiabetic population. In 
      conclusion, stage 3 to 5 CKD is associated with increased CAC scores, but this 
      association may be substantially stronger among adults with diabetes. These findings 
      need to be confirmed in study populations that include adults >65 yr of age and a 
      larger number of CKD cases.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Predicts Less Coronary Artery Calcification and Diabetic Kidney 
      Disease Over 12 Years in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: The CACTI Study.
PG  - 297-302
LID - 10.2337/dc18-1527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Novel biomarkers are needed to better predict coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and diabetic kidney 
      disease (DKD) in type 1 diabetes. We evaluated the associations between serum 
      uromodulin (SUMOD [a biomarker associated with anti-inflammatory and renal 
      protective properties]), CAC progression, and DKD development over 12 years. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 527, 53% females) in the Coronary 
      Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study were examined during 
      2002-2004, at a mean age of 39.6 ± 9.0 years and a median duration of diabetes of 
      24.8 years. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) determined by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease 
      Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation were measured at baseline and after 
      a mean follow-up period of 12.1 ± 1.5 years. Elevated albumin excretion was defined 
      as ACR ≥30 mg/g, rapid GFR decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year), and impaired GFR as 
      eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SUMOD was measured on stored baseline plasma samples 
      (Meso Scale Discovery). CAC was measured using electron beam computed tomography. 
      CAC progression was defined as a change in the square root-transformed CAC volume of 
      ≥2.5. RESULTS: Higher baseline SUMOD level conferred lower odds of CAC progression 
      (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.97), incident elevated albumin excretion (0.37; 
      0.16-0.86), rapid GFR decline (0.56; 0.35-0.91), and impaired GFR (0.44; 0.24-0.83) 
      per 1 SD increase in SUMOD (68.44 ng/mL) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, 
      systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and albuminuria/GFR. The addition of SUMOD 
      to models with traditional risk factors also significantly improved the prediction 
      performance for CAC progression and incident DKD. CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline SUMOD 
      level predicted lower odds of both CAC progression and incident DKD over 12 years in 
      adults with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in Korean patients with incident dialysis.
PG  - 367-374
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12493 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with chronic kidney disease have an extremely high risk of 
      developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with end-stage renal disease 
      (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased mortality 
      from CVD. METHODS: The present study aimed to investigate the risk factors for CAC 
      in Korean patients with incident dialysis. Data on 423 patients with ESRD who 
      started dialysis therapy between December 2012 and March 2014 were obtained from 10 
      university-affiliated hospitals. CAC was identified by using noncontrast-enhanced 
      cardiac multidetector computed tomography. The CAC score was calculated according to 
      the Agatston score, with CAC-positive subjects defined by an Agatston score >0. 
      FINDINGS: Patients' mean age was 55.6 ± 14.6 years, and 64.1% were men. The 
      CAC-positive rate was 63.8% (270 of 423). Results of univariate analyses showed 
      significant differences in age, sex, etiology of ESRD and comorbid conditions 
      according to the CAC score. However, results of multiple regression analysis showed 
      that only a higher age was significantly associated with the CAC score. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves showed that the sensitivity and specificity of 
      L-spine radiography for diagnosing CAC were 56% and 91%, respectively, for 
      diagnosing CAC (area under the curve, 0.735). DISCUSSION: CAC was frequent in 
      patients with incident dialysis, and multiple regression analysis showed that only 
      age was significantly associated with the CAC score. In addition, L-spine 
      radiography could be a helpful modality for diagnosing CAC in patients with incident 
      dialysis.

TI  - The Correlation of Serum Osteoprotegerin with Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk 
      Factors and Arterial Stiffness in Patients with Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: 
      Results from the KNOW-CKD Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) plays protective roles against the development of 
      vascular calcification (VC) which greatly contributes to the increased 
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present 
      study aimed to find the non-traditional, kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors 
      correlated to serum OPG and the effect of serum OPG on the arterial stiffness 
      measured by brachial ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in patients with the 
      pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed the data from the patients 
      in whom baPWV and the serum OPG were measured at the time of enrollment in a 
      prospective pre-dialysis CKD cohort study in Korea. RESULTS: Along with traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, pulse pressure, and 
      baPWV, non-traditional, kidney-related factors such as albuminuria, plasma level of 
      hemoglobin, total CO(2) content, alkaline phosphatase, and corrected calcium were 
      independent variables for serum OPG in multivariate linear regression. Reciprocally, 
      the serum OPG was positively associated with baPWV in multivariate linear 
      regression. The baPWV in the 3rd and 4th quartile groups of serum OPG were higher 
      than that in the 1st quartile group after adjustments by age, sex and other 
      significant factors for baPWV in linear mixed model. CONCLUSION: Non-traditional, 
      kidney-related cardiovascular risk factors in addition to traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors were related to serum level of OPG in CKD. Serum OPG level was 
      significantly related to baPWV. Our study suggests that kidney-related factors 
      involved in CKD-specific pathways for VC play a role in the increased secretion of 
      OPG into circulation in patients with CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT01630486.

TI  - Abdominal aorta and pelvic artery calcifications on plain radiographs may predict 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and renal transplantation.
PG  - 355-364
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1758-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard for 
      evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less 
      costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries 
      has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome 
      predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of 
      abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in 
      predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance 
      hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. METHODS: Four 
      hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic 
      radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the 
      methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were 
      followed prospectively for 5 years. RESULTS: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with 
      the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT 
      (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher 
      prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and 
      eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, 
      whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function 
      and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 
      as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, 
      whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all 
      three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, 
      whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. 
      Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, 
      serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but 
      not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients. CONCLUSION: PAC was better than AAC in predicting 
      mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.

LID - 10.1038/ki.2009.298 [doi]
AB  - We studied the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcification in people 
      with early chronic kidney disease. We used a cohort of 562 adult patients with 
      chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 
      ml/min/1.73 m(2), in a community-based study of people without clinical 
      cardiovascular disease, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The majority had 
      stage 3 disease. Coronary artery calcification was measured at baseline and again 
      approximately 1.6 or 3.2 years later. The prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification at baseline was 66%, and its adjusted prevalence was 24% lower in 
      African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The incidence of coronary artery 
      calcification was 6.1% per year in women and 14.8% in men. Coronary artery 
      calcification progressed in approximately 17% of subjects per year across all 
      subgroups, and diabetes was associated with a 65% greater adjusted risk of 
      progression. Male gender and diabetes were the only factors associated with adjusted 
      coronary artery calcification incidence and progression, respectively. Our study 
      shows that coronary artery calcification is common in people with stage 3 disease, 
      progresses rapidly, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian 
      patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF). METHODS: 
      Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. Predictors of 
      patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier 
      survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency rates. RESULTS: 
      Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 
      months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Univariate analysis 
      showed that factors which predict for patency include male gender (p = 0.003), good 
      diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031), pre-dialysis status (p = 
      0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and non-calcified radial arteries (p = 
      0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 
      0.472) did not predict for primary AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the 
      male gender to be an independent predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). 
      Subset analysis showed a significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 
      mm amongst males, as compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no 
      statistical difference in the average cephalic vein diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Within 
      our Asian study population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 
      58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Male 
      gender is an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. In females or patients with 
      calcified radial arteries, a more proximal AVF should be considered.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease is the first leading cause of death in 
      hemodialysis patients. In this population, cardiovascular calcifications occur at an 
      earlier age and progress faster than in general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 
      order to determine the prevalence and risk factors of cardiac calcifications, 49 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis were screened in the coronary arteries and cardiac 
      valves by the 64 multi-slice ultra-fast CT and the transthoracic echocardiography. 
      Different clinical and biological parameters were studied by the SPSS 10.0 
      statistical software to determine risk factors. RESULT: Cardiac calcifications were 
      identified in 81.6% of cases in at least one of the two studied sites. The coronary 
      artery involvement was more common than valvular and concerned 69.4% of cases. The 
      mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (ACACS) was 331.1 and 522.2 in coronary 
      patients and was correlated to alteration of systolic function of LV (r=-0.287, 
      P=0.045). The severity of CACS was positively correlated with age (r=0.332, P=0.02). 
      Coronary calcifications were associated with cardiovascular risk common to those of 
      the general population (age, male sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, history of 
      ischemic heart disease), but also to a lesser quality of dialysis. Valvular 
      calcifications were present in 49% of cases and were correlated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (P=0.006). The exclusive involvement of the aortic valve was 
      the most common valvular abnormality. Phosphocalcic and lipid parameters, levels of 
      hemoglobin, CRP and uric acid did not predisposed to cardiac calcifications in our 
      patients. DISCUSSION: In hemodialysis patients, the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
      calcification is complex and cannot be attributed to a passive process. This process 
      involves several factors that can promote or inhibit calcification. The new 
      multi-slice ultra-fast scanner is a very sensitive method for topographic and 
      quantitative assessment of coronary calcification and is a better alternative to 
      invasive techniques. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high prevalence of cardiac 
      calcification in hemodialysis, and highlights the importance of early screening and 
      treatment of predisposing factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes of calcification scores of the abdominal aorta (CSAA) after 
      total parathyroidectomy plus autotransplantation (TPX + AT) for symptomatic 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SSHP) have never been reported. METHODS: Forty-nine 
      patients who successfully underwent TPX + AT for SSHP were enrolled; 13 patients who 
      had regular hemodialysis were enrolled as controls. Preoperatively, patients' age, 
      gender, and duration of dialysis were recorded. Serum Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase 
      (Alk-ptase), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), vitamin D, FGF23, and Klotho levels, 
      and CSAA were measured. One year postoperatively, these data were measured again. In 
      the control group, these data were recorded and measured before and one year later. 
      RESULTS: Serum iPTH, Alk-ptase and FGF23 levels and CSAA of the study group were 
      significantly higher than those of the control group. One year postoperatively, 
      serum Ca, P, Alk-ptase, iPTH, and FGF23 levels and CSAA were significantly lower 
      than those before surgery. Except for FGF23 levels, other items of the control group 
      did not change significantly one year later, whereas the study group decreased CSAA 
      more than the control group. CONCLUSION: One year postoperatively, CSAA decreased.

LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease, 
      the major cause of death in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Longitudinal 
      studies of vascular calcification in KTRs are few and small and have short 
      follow-up. We assessed the evolution of coronary artery (CAC) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification and their determinants in a cohort of prevalent KTRs. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Longitudinal. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The Agatston score of coronary arteries and 
      thoracic aorta was measured by 16-slice spiral computed tomography in 281 KTRs. 
      PREDICTORS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were recorded 
      simultaneously. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The Agatston score was measured again 3.5 
      or more years later. RESULTS: Repeated analyzable computed tomographic scans were 
      available for 197 (70%) KTRs after 4.40 ± 0.28 years; they were not available for 
      the rest of patients because of death (n = 40), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), other 
      arrhythmias (n = 4), refusal (n = 35), or technical problems precluding confident 
      calcium scoring (n = 4). CAC and aorta calcification scores increased significantly 
      (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during follow-up. By 
      multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history of 
      cardiovascular event, use of a statin, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level were 
      independent determinants of CAC progression. Independent determinants of aorta 
      calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score, higher 
      pulse pressure, use of a statin, older age, higher serum phosphate level, use of 
      aspirin, and male sex. Significant regression of CAC or aorta calcification was not 
      observed in this cohort. LIMITATIONS: Cohort of prevalent KTRs with potential 
      survival bias; few patients with diabetes and nonwhites, limiting the 
      generalizability of results. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous small short-term 
      studies, we show that vascular calcification progression is substantial within 4 
      years in prevalent KTRs and is associated with several traditional and 
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors, some of which are modifiable.

TI  - Aortic calcification predicts cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 1314-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among renal 
      transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with increased mortality 
      in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic calcification among renal 
      transplant recipients is unknown. Our objective was to prospectively examine the 
      association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause 
      mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients. METHODS: One 
      hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent electron beam computed 
      tomography. Aortic calcification was scored by the Agatston method. The mean 
      follow-up time was 5.1 years. Cardiovascular events (heart failure, coronary artery 
      disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause mortality were 
      recorded. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62% Caucasians, 38% African Americans and 
      62% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 +/- 12.5 years. Thirty-four percent had 
      aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular events and 10 deaths were 
      recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification had more cardiovascular events compared 
      to those without aortic calcification (23.7 versus 4.1%, P = 0.001). Recipients with 
      aortic calcification had higher mortality compared to those without aortic 
      calcification but it did not reach statistical significance (15.8 versus 5.4%, P = 
      0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic calcification score in a proportional 
      hazard Cox model to assess event-free survival was 1.15 (1.04-1.27, P = 0.01). 
      Diabetes and aortic calcification score were independently associated with survival. 
      In addition to the predictors above, dialysis vintage was an independent predictor 
      for combined future cardiovascular event and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 
      aortic calcification is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is 
      predictive of future cardiovascular events. Aortic calcification is easily 
      identified by non-invasive testing, and should be considered when assessing 
      cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between corneoconjunctival calcification and 
      conjunctival squamous metaplasia in patients with chronic renal failure (CRP). STUDY 
      DESIGN: We studied impression cytology in 45 CRF patients on regular hemodialysis 
      and 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Specimens were obtainedfrom the temporal 
      bulbar conjunctiva using cellulose acetate filter paper. The samples were fixed in a 
      mixture of 70% ethyl alcohol, 37% formaldehyde and glacial acetic acid and then 
      stained with a combination of periodic acid- Schiff and Gill's modified Papanicolaou 
      stain and graded by a masked observer. Corneoconjunctival calcification was graded 
      by the Porter-Crombie classification. RESULTS: Of 45 study patients, 4 (9%) 
      disclosed grade 0, 23 (51%) grade 1, 14 (31%) grade 2 and 4 grade 3 (9%) impression 
      cytology changes. There was a statistically significant difference between the 
      patient and control groups (p < 0.001). Calcium deposits were more frequent and 
      extensive in CRF patients than in controls (p = 0.01). There was no correlation 
      between impression cytology and calcium deposit grades (p = 0.128). However the 
      presence of conjunctival inflammation correlated with the existence of extensive 
      squamous metaplasia (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The severity of conjunctival changes in 
      CRF patients on regular hemodialysis are not related to calcium deposition but to 
      acute conjunctival inflammation.

PG  - 3123-5
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.05.123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors in patients 
      undergoing dialysis therapy or transplantation is associated with a 3.5- to 50-fold 
      higher risk than in the general population. The primary cause of death in transplant 
      recipients is cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To report echocardiographic 
      findings using a screening protocol to detect heart disease in candidates for kidney 
      transplantation. METHODS: Between November 2005 and December 2009, we examined 356 
      patients using 2-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: A high 
      prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, 
      valvulopathy, and valve calcification was observed. There was a positive correlation 
      between valve calcification and female sex, age (P<.001), duration of renal 
      replacement therapy (P=.01), peripheral arterial disease (P=.02), cerebrovascular 
      disease (P=.005), and high concentration of lipoprotein(a) (P=.02). CONCLUSION: An 
      echocardiographic study should be part of the initial evaluation in candidates for 
      renal transplantation.

TI  - Increased Peripheral Arterial Calcification in Patients Receiving Warfarin.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002665 [doi]
LID - e002665
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification. Warfarin use is associated with increased breast arterial 
      calcification, but whether this is reflective of other arteries or occurs in men is 
      unclear. In this study, the prevalence of calcification in peripheral arteries was 
      compared in patients with and without warfarin therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This 
      retrospective matched cohort study assessed 430 patients with radiographs performed 
      during or after warfarin therapy who were identified by a computerized search of 
      medical records. Each patient was matched to a patient without warfarin exposure 
      based on age, sex, and diabetes status. Patients with warfarin exposure <1 month, 
      history of end-stage renal disease, or serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
      Radiographs were reviewed visually for arterial calcification. The prevalence of 
      arterial calcification was 44% greater in patients with versus without warfarin use 
      (30.2% versus 20.9%, P=0.0023) but not on radiographs performed before warfarin 
      therapy (26.4% versus 22.4%, n=156) or prior to 5 years of warfarin therapy. The 
      increase was noted only in the ankle and foot, was limited to a medial pattern of 
      calcification, and was similar in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use is 
      associated with lower extremity arterial calcification in both men and women 
      independent of age, sex, diabetes status, and other patient characteristics. This 
      may have implications for the choice of therapies for long-term anticoagulation.

TI  - The relationship between poor nutritional status and progression of aortic 
      calcification in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 71
LID - 10.1186/s12882-018-0872-y [doi]
LID - 71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on 
      prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification 
      progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients 
      on HD. METHODS: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. 
      Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular 
      blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification 
      index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was 
      evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment 
      ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI 
      values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified 
      into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) 
      and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, 
      comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between 
      ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI 
      progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, 
      respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 
      year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. 
      The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 
      (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic 
      nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact 
      parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were 
      male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the 
      progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to 
      improve progression of aortic calcification in patients on HD. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Association of serum calcitonin with coronary artery disease in individuals with and 
      without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1169-75
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0076-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral 
      metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as 
      novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, 
      another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in 
      detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and 
      the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, 
      in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 
      87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the associations 
      between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × phosphate 
      product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 
      25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, the Gensini CAD 
      severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 
      25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for 
      the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin 
      D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), 
      FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini 
      score. In the second step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, 
      proteinuria, and GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained 
      statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of 
      mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater severity 
      of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and nontraditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger populations including 
      patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vascular calcification can predict cardiovascular (CV) morbidity 
      and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. We evaluated the prevalence, 
      association factors, and outcomes of chest X-ray-detected aortic arch calcification 
      (AoAC) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). METHODS: We included 190 
      patients undergoing PD (mean age, 52.6 ± 14.3 years) for whom chest radiographs were 
      available. AoAC revealed by chest X-ray was graded from 0 to 3 according to an AoAC 
      score (AoACS). Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the factors 
      associated with AoACS. After adjusting for age, sex, PD duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      mean blood pressure, and history of CV disease, the association between AoAC grading 
      and mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard 
      model. RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001), PD duration (p = 0.004), history of CV disease 
      (p < 0.001), and renal Kt/V (p = 0.031) were associated with AoACS. After a mean 
      follow-up of 55.1 ± 32.1 months, patients with Grade 2 (p = 0.011) or Grade 3 
      (p < 0.001) AoAC had higher all-cause mortality than patients with Grade 0 AoAC. In 
      addition, patients with Grades 2 and 3 AoAC had higher CV-related mortality than 
      those with Grades 0 and 1 AoAC (p = 0.013). Grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.736; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 1.038-7.211; p = 0.042] and Grade 3 AoAC (HR = 3.289; 95% 
      CI, 1.156-9.359; p = 0.026) remained associated with all-cause mortality after 
      adjustment. Similarly, Grades 2 and 3 AoAC (HR = 36.05; 95% CI, 3.494-372; 
      p = 0.026) significantly correlated with CV mortality after adjustment. CONCLUSION: 
      In patients undergoing PD, CXR-detected severe AoAC was an independent risk factor 
      for all-cause and CV mortalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk factors for mitral annular calcification (MAC) and cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD) demonstrate significant overlap in the general population. The aim of 
      this paper is to determine whether there are independent relationships between MAC 
      and demographics, traditional and novel CVD risk factors using cardiac CT in the 
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: A 
      sample of 2070 subjects underwent coronary calcium scanning during the CRIC study. 
      Data were obtained for each participant at time of scan. SUBJECTS: were dichotomized 
      into the presence and absence of MAC. Differences in baseline demographic and 
      transitional risk factor data were evaluated across groups. Covariates used in 
      multivariable adjustment were age, gender, BMI, HDL, LDL, lipid lowering 
      medications, smoking status, family history of heart attack, hypertension, diabetes 
      mellitus, phosphate, PTH, albuminuria, and calcium. RESULTS: Our study consisted of 
      2070 subjects, of which 331 had MAC (prevalence of 16.0%). The mean MAC score was 
      511.98 (SD 1368.76). Age and white race remained independently associated with 
      presence of MAC. Decreased GFR was also a risk factor. African American and Hispanic 
      race, as well as former smoking status were protective against MAC. In multivariable 
      adjusted analyses, the remaining covariates were not significantly associated with 
      MAC. Among renal covariates, elevated phosphate was significant. CONCLUSION: In the 
      CRIC population, presence of MAC was independently associated with age, Caucasian 
      race, decreased GFR, and elevated phosphate. These results are suggested by 
      mechanisms of dysregulation of inflammation, hormones, and electrolytes in subjects 
      with renal disease.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of abdominal aortic calcification in healthy living kidney 
      donors.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0485-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common and is both a marker and a cause 
      of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially so in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Renal transplantation is the cornerstone of the successful 
      long-term management of CKD, and in order to satisfy transplantation needs, more use 
      is made now of living kidney donors (LKD). Prior to selection for transplantation, 
      much screening of potential LKD takes place, including for cardiovascular issues. It 
      is not known; however, how much these potentially healthy LKD may be prone to 
      clinically silent VC. METHODS: We identified 103 living kidney donors from 2011 
      renal transplant records. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using 
      existing abdominal CT imaging using multi-channel CT aortograms (used primarily to 
      assess renal vascular anatomy). Using these CT scans, manual calcium scoring was 
      undertaken to calculate total aortic calcium load (AAC severity score). The 
      prevalence, severity and associations of AAC between calcified and non-calcified 
      donors were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 103 donors were identified from 
      records. Ninety three of these had detailed clinical records to complement their CT 
      scans. Fifty of ninety-three donors were male, and the mean age was 45.9 ± 1.8 
      years. Mean MDRD eGFR was 88.73 ± 2.97 ml/min/1.73 m(2). 7.14 ± 3.07 % of the aorta 
      in these donors was calcified with a mean AAC severity score of 0.98 ± 0.56. In 
      kidney donors >50 years of age, there was significantly more AAC than in those <50: 
      2.47 ± 1.56 versus 0.31 ± 0.29, p < 0.001. There was no relationship between the 
      presence or severity of aortic VC and donor GFR, systolic blood pressure, pulse 
      pressure, calcium-phosphate product or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: AAC prevalence, 
      patterns and severity in this important donor population have not previously been 
      described in the literature. There was relatively little VC in what would be 
      regarded as a "healthy" donor population. VC was more common with age, but the other 
      possible risk factors for the presence or severity of VC did not impact on overall 
      AAC scores. VC did not influence vascular stiffness as represented by pulse 
      pressure. Following the evolution of AAC over time in those who have donated a 
      kidney, and lost some global renal function as a consequence, would be of 
      considerable interest.

TI  - Vascular calcifications and renal osteodystrophy in chronic hemodialysis patients: 
      what is the relationship between them?
PG  - 1179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11255-010-9841-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are 
      frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality 
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, 
      but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our 
      study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD 
      patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between 
      VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients. METHODS: We 
      examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 
      81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis. RESULTS: We 
      found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC 
      (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear 
      regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus 
      (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum 
      albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment 
      with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations 
      between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D 
      treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. CONCLUSION: There seems 
      to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. 
      Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium 
      salts are risk factors for VCs.

TI  - Cutaneous calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a regulated 
      process associated with in situ osteopontin expression.
PG  - 900-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calcification, or calcinosis cutis (CC), is found in 
      approximately 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic 
      dialysis. While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it may be similar to those 
      for medial and intimal vascular calcifications, which are actively regulated 
      processes. OBSERVATION: In a retrospective study of 9 patients, the role of an 
      active calcification process leading to CC was assessed by the immunohistochemical 
      detection of osteopontin, which is a regulator of osseous and extra-osseous 
      calcification processes. Calcinosis cutis was associated with female sex, vascular 
      comorbidity, inconstant secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of plasma 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Six patients had a favorable outcome after the lowering 
      of plasma calcium levels during dialysis or after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Calcinosis of the vascular media of subcutaneous vessels was the most common 
      histologic feature and was always associated with osteopontin staining, suggesting 
      that CC is a regulated process. Moreover, to our knowledge, extravascular staining 
      of osteopontin in sweat glands, nerves, and macrophages was demonstrated for the 
      first time in this study.

TI  - Association of conjunctival and corneal calcification with vascular calcification in 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and easily 
      detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
      calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone metabolism 
      parameters in dialysis patients. METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30 men, 33 
      women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were on dialysis therapy for more than 6 
      months. Forty-four patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients were on 
      hemodialysis therapy. The same observer evaluated the presence of CCC by using a 
      slit-lamp microscope, and a total CCC score was recorded for each patient. Fifty-two 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls also were evaluated by using the same method. 
      Biochemical data were collected from patient files. Bone mineral density (BMD) of 
      the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured, and the presence of vascular 
      calcification was assessed by using x-ray examinations of the pelvis and hands. 
      RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly higher than that in controls 
      (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC score correlated significantly with 
      duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s = 0.392; P = 0.002), serum phosphorus 
      level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium x phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 
      0.007). However, we did not find a significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The 
      frequency of vascular calcification was significantly greater in patients with a 
      high CCC score (CCC score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% 
      versus 5.6%; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and 
      noninvasive method. It seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to 
      assess the status of extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

TI  - Impact of BMI on cardiovascular events, renal function, and coronary artery 
      calcification.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1159/000362862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in the 
      general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI on 
      CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease not on 
      dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis initiation, 
      and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients. METHODS: CKD patients were 
      divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of dialysis, and 
      extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and multivariable analysis 
      were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD 
      stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, 
      albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour 
      proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 
      years. RESULTS: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 
      0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not increase 
      the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or 
      multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not 
      increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 
      0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 
      0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to 
      other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 
      95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of 
      CAC extent or progression. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High 
      BMI increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to 
      CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact 
      of high BMI on dialysis initiation.

TI  - Mitral annular calcification predicts mortality and coronary artery disease in end 
      stage renal disease.
PG  - 348-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether mitral annular calcification (MAC) 
      predicts mortality and cardiac disease in a group of renal transplant candidates. 
      METHODS: Hundred and forty patients were prospectively studied. All had 
      echocardiography and coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) 
      was defined as luminal stenosis >70% by visual estimation in at least one coronary 
      artery. RESULTS: There were 21 deaths over a follow-up period of 2.2+/-0.7 years. 
      MAC occurred in 56 patients (40%) and was associated with higher mortality (p=0.04). 
      Patients with MAC were older (p=or<0.001), had larger left ventricular (LV) end 
      systolic (p=0.005) and LV end diastolic (p=0.04) diameter, larger left atrial 
      diameter (p=0.001), lower LV fractional shortening (p=0.003), larger LV mass index 
      (p=0.04) and higher mitral E/Ea ratio (p=0.03) compared to those without. Plasma 
      calcium (p=0.002), phosphate (p=0.004), cardiac troponin T (p=0.03), N-terminal 
      Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (p=0.004) concentrations were higher in those with 
      MAC but gender, total cholesterol, haemoglobin and creatinine were similar in the 
      two groups. The proportion diabetic (p=0.03), on dialysis (p=0.05), with significant 
      CAD (p=or<0.001), taking calcium containing phosphate binders (p=0.02) and Vitamin 
      D3 (p=0.04) was significantly higher in those with MAC. Significant CAD (OR 12, 95% 
      CI 3.25, p=0.001) was the only independent associate of MAC. CONCLUSIONS: MAC is 
      associated with increased mortality and significant CAD in ESRD. These patients have 
      increased LV cavity size, poorer LV systolic function, higher LV filling pressures 
      compared to patients without MAC.

PG  - E35-40
LID - 10.1111/sdi.12335 [doi]
AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis 
      vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This study 
      examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in brachial 
      and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven 
      radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine predialysis 
      and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender matched controls 
      undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation (6 renal). Arterial 
      stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology, morphometric analysis of 
      intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load was performed using standard 
      techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients demonstrated significant arterial 
      intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio higher than controls (0.13 ± 0.12 vs. 
      0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium deposition was demonstrated on histology and the 
      calcium content in patients was higher than controls (34.68 ± 26.86 vs. 
      10.95 ± 9.18 μg/μg, p = 0.003). The blood vessel calcium content correlated with 
      arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p = 0.018). This study for the first time describes, 
      and suggests mechanistic linkage between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium 
      deposition, and increased functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis 
      patients. Our research could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the 
      uremic vasculature impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic calcification is 
      more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of adverse cardiovascular 
      outcome. The aim of the present study was to characterize aortic calcification in 
      renal compared with non-renal patients. METHODS: Aortas of 31 patients with advanced 
      CKD and of 31 age-and gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. Calcium and 
      phosphorus content in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis. The expression 
      of calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting proteins was assessed using 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The calcium and phosphorus content of the aorta was 
      higher in CKD patients than in controls. Even in non-calcified aortic specimens of 
      CKD, staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine was 
      significantly more marked compared to controls. The same proteins were 
      immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens of both CKD and controls. In contrast, 
      staining for transglutaminase-2 and Fetuin A was significantly reduced in CKD. 
      Higher expression of cbfa-1 and Pit-1 was observed in all calcified aortas with no 
      difference between CKD and controls. The expression of TNF-alpha, phospho-p38 and 
      Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of upregulation of BMP-2 and osteoblastic 
      transdifferentiation by VSMC even in non-calcified areas of the aortas of CKD. 
      CONCLUSION: The expression of markers characteristic for calcification is not 
      different in calcified aorta of CKD patients compared to controls, but in CKD 
      patients, evidence of inflammation, transformation to an osteoblastic phenotype and 
      reduced expression of transglutaminase are also found even in non-calcified aorta.

AB  - Uremia accelerates atherosclerosis, but little is known about affected pathways in 
      human vasculature. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed arterial 
      transcripts in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Global mRNA expression 
      was estimated by microarray hybridization in iliac arteries ( n = 14) from renal 
      transplant recipients and compared with renal arteries from healthy living kidney 
      donors ( n = 19) in study 1. Study 2 compared nonatherosclerotic internal mammary 
      arteries (IMA) from five patients with elevated plasma creatinine levels and age- 
      and sex-matched controls with normal creatinine levels. Western blotting and 
      immunohistochemistry for selected proteins were performed on a subset of study 1 
      samples. Fifteen gene transcripts were significantly different between the two 
      groups in study 1 [fold changes (FC) > 1.05 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 
      0.005]. Most upregulated mRNAs associated with cellular signaling, apoptosis, 
      TNFα/NF-κB signaling, smooth muscle contraction, and 10 other pathways were 
      significantly affected. To focus attention on genes from genuine vascular cells, 
      which dominate in IMA, concordant deregulated genes in studies 1 and 2 were examined 
      and included 23 downregulated and eight upregulated transcripts (settings in study 
      1: FC > 1.05 and FDR < 0.05; study 2: FC > 1.2 and P < 0.2). Selected deregulated 
      gene products were investigated at the protein level, and whereas HIF3α confirmed 
      mRNA upregulation, vimentin showed upregulation in contrast to the mRNA results. We 
      conclude that arteries from CKD patients display change in relatively few sets of 
      genes. Many were related to differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. 
      These identified genes may contribute to understanding the development of arterial 
      injury among patients with CKD.

TI  - Calcification of coronary intima and media: immunohistochemistry, backscatter 
      imaging, and x-ray analysis in renal and nonrenal patients.
PG  - 121-34
AB  - Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In patients with 
      chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of coronary calcification are 
      increased. It has remained uncertain whether it is the intima of the coronaries or 
      the media that is calcified and whether the morphologic details of calcified plaques 
      differ between renal and nonrenal patients. Autopsy samples of coronaries were 
      obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and gender-matched nonuremic 
      patients. Specimens were examined using light and electron microscopy, 
      immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray analysis. In coronaries, 
      calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the intima area in renal versus 
      nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/- 11.9%) but occupied a significantly 
      higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of 
      the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was 
      significantly more intensive around coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal 
      patients. The non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients showed minimal staining 
      for fetuin, but fetuin staining was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, 
      more pronounced deposition of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal 
      patients, and glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in 
      renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more intense in 
      the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal compared with 
      nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal patients is 
      suggested by more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers of 
      inflammation.

TI  - Aortic stiffness and calcification in men in a population-based international study.
PG  - 473-7
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aortic stiffness, a hallmark of vascular aging, is an independent risk 
      factor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The association of aortic 
      stiffness with aortic calcification in middle-aged general population remains 
      unknown although studies in patients with end-stage renal disease or elderly 
      subjects suggest that aortic calcification is an important determinant of aortic 
      stiffness. The goal of this study was to examine the association of aortic 
      calcification and stiffness in multi-ethnic population-based samples of relatively 
      young men. METHODS: We examined the association in 906 men aged 40-49 (81 Black 
      Americans, 276 Japanese Americans, 258 White Americans and 291 Koreans). Aortic 
      stiffness was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) using an 
      automated waveform analyzer. Aortic calcification from aortic arch to iliac 
      bifurcation was evaluated using electron-beam computed tomography. RESULTS: Aortic 
      calcium score was calculated and was categorized into four groups: zero (n=303), 
      1-100 (n=411), 101-300 (n=110), and 401+ (n=82). Aortic calcification category had a 
      significant positive association with cfPWV after adjusting for age, race, and mean 
      arterial pressure (mean (standard error) of cfPWV (cm/s) from the lowest to highest 
      categories: 836 (10), 850 (9), 877 (17) and 941 (19), P for trend <0.001). The 
      significant positive association remained after further adjusting for other 
      cardiovascular risk factors. The significant positive association was also observed 
      in each race group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that aortic calcification can 
      be one mechanism for aortic stiffness and that the association of aortic 
      calcification with stiffness starts as early as the 40s.

TI  - A case-control study of calciphylaxis in Japanese end-stage renal disease patients.
PG  - 1580-4
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr658 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and 
      often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is characterized by painful 
      skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification and intimal proliferation of small 
      arteries. Studies in western countries have reported incidences ranging from 1 to 4% 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients. Since no systematic studies of calciphylaxis have 
      ever been performed in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey and a case-control 
      study to identify the characteristics of calciphylaxis in the Japanese dialysis 
      population. METHODS: Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760 hemodialysis centers 
      in Japan, asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been encountered in the past, and 
      detailed clinical data regarding each case were then collected from the centers. In 
      addition, two control dialysis patients matched for age and duration of hemodialysis 
      to each calciphylaxis case were identified at the participating centers, and their 
      data were analyzed to identify risk factors for calciphylaxis. RESULTS: Responses to 
      the questionnaire were obtained from 1838 centers (48.3%), and 151 centers reported 
      that a total of 249 cases had been encountered. Sixty-four centers agreed to 
      participate in the case-control study, and detailed clinical data in regard to 67 
      cases were obtained. In 28 of the 67 cases, a definite diagnosis of calciphylaxis 
      was made by our study group based on the clinical characteristics and skin biopsy 
      findings. A univariate logistic regression model comparing them with 56-matched 
      controls identified warfarin therapy [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI)] 2.7-48.1, P=0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR 19.8, 95% 
      CI 4.4-89.5, P=0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma glucose level (OR 3.74, 
      95% CI 1.08-12.9, P=0.037) and each 1 mg/dL increment in adjusted serum calcium 
      level (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.63-6.30, P=0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly 
      associated with calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with 
      female gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted 
      calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin therapy and 
      lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk factors after a multivariate 
      logistic regression model analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed 
      that warfarin therapy and lower serum albumin levels are significant and strong risk 
      factors for the development of calciphylaxis in chronic hemodialysis patients in 
      Japan.

AB  - Cardiovascular mortality in kidney transplant recipients has shown to be 
      substantially elevated particularly in the first year of transplantation. Complex 
      ventricular arrhythmia (VA) has been pointed as one of the etiologies of sudden 
      death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of VA and to investigate 
      the factors associated with their occurrence in incident kidney transplant 
      recipients. A total of 100 incident kidney transplant recipients were included in 
      the study (39.7 ± 10.1 years, 55% male, 43.6 ± 10.1 days of transplantation, 66% 
      living donors). All the patients underwent 24 h electrocardiogram, echocardiogram 
      and multi-slice computed tomography. Thirty percent of the patients had VA. Left 
      ventricular hypertrophy was observed in 57% of the patients while heart failure was 
      found in 5%. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was observed in 26 patients, from 
      which 31% had severe calcification. The group of patients with VA was predominantly 
      male, had been on dialysis therapy for a longer time and had more coronary 
      calcification. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, male gender and CAC 
      score were independently associated with the presence of VA. In conclusion, kidney 
      transplant recipients exhibited a high prevalence of VA and the factors associated 
      with its occurrence were the male gender and the presence of CAC.

TI  - Predictors of coronary disease in patients with end stage renal disease.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Patients with end stage renal disease have a high prevalence of cardiovascular 
      disease and coronary arteriography is often routinely performed prior to kidney 
      transplantation. However, the value of the conventional risk factors and 
      non-invasive markers of coronary artery disease (CAD) in triaging patients for 
      coronary arteriography has not been fully examined. 116 patients with end stage 
      renal disease were evaluated. Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients 
      either for a suspicion of CAD or as part of a routine pre-transplant evaluation. 
      Lesions causing > or = 50% luminal diameter stenosis in any of the three major 
      coronary artery systems were considered significant. The mean age was 53.3 +/- 9.3 
      years. Significant CAD was present in 69 patients (60%). Increasing age, family 
      history of premature ischemic heart disease, the presence of angina, abnormal Q 
      waves on the ECG or abnormal ST segment depression and the presence of coronary 
      calcification were significant markers of coronary artery disease. However male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus and obesity did not correlate with coronary disease. Even 
      though hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking were also not useful 
      predictors these could have been modified by the renal failure. In conclusion 
      increasing age, a family history of premature ischemic heart disease and some 
      non-invasive markers were useful predictors of coronary disease.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem 
      in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular 
      calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate 
      human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. 
      HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels of inorganic phosphate 
      (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in media containing 
      phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 
      mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies 
      showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the 
      osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of 
      elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate 
      cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor 
      phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium 
      deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was 
      identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that 
      elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that 
      predispose to calcification and offers a novel explanation of the phenomenon of 
      vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined 
      the factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic 
      hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular 
      calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the significant factors 
      affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, 
      increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic 
      pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly 
      stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and 
      offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under 
      hyperphosphatemic conditions.

TI  - Association of mild to moderate kidney dysfunction and coronary calcification.
PG  - 579-85
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2007070765 [doi]
AB  - Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is prevalent and predicts mortality among 
      patients with ESRD, but whether less severe kidney dysfunction is associated with 
      CAC is uncertain. To address this question, 6749 participants of the Multi-Ethnic 
      Study of Atherosclerosis, who were middle-aged and without known cardiovascular 
      disease, were evaluated. Renal function was categorized by cystatin C quartiles and 
      estimated GFR (eGFR; < to >60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), and CAC was evaluated by 
      computed tomography (CT). Fifty percent of participants had CAC, mean cystatin C was 
      0.90 mg/L, and 10% had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). In unadjusted analysis, kidney 
      dysfunction by either measure was strongly associated with CAC; however, the 
      associations were lost after adjustment for age, gender, race, hypertension, and 
      IL-6 (relative risk 1.04 [95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.11] for the highest 
      cystatin C quartile compared with the lowest, and relative risk 1.03 [95% confidence 
      interval 0.98 to 1.08] for eGFR below compared with above 60 m/min per 1.73 m(2)). 
      Similarly, neither higher cystatin C nor eGFR <60 was associated with severity of 
      CAC. These results suggest that a higher burden of CAC is unlikely to explain the 
      association between mild to moderate kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular 
      mortality.

TI  - Large artery calcification on dialysis patients is located in the intima and related 
      to atherosclerosis.
PG  - 303-10
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04290510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) has a significant effect in 
      cardiovascular diseases on dialysis patients. However, VC is assessed with 
      x-ray-based techniques, which do not inform about calcium localization (intima, 
      media, atherosclerosis-related). The aim of this work is to study VC and its related 
      factors using arterial ultrasound to report the exact location of calcium. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was an observational, cross-sectional, 
      case-control study that included 232 patients in dialysis and 208 age- and 
      sex-matched controls with normal kidney function. Demographic data and laboratory 
      values were collated. Carotid, femoral, and brachial ultrasounds were performed to 
      assess VC and atherosclerosis burden using a standardized protocol. RESULTS: 
      Cardiovascular risk factors were predominantly found in controls, although the 
      burden of atherosclerosis was higher in the dialysis group. VC was significantly 
      more prevalent in the group of patients on dialysis than control subjects, and in 
      both groups the most prevalent pattern of VC was linear calcification located in the 
      intima of the artery wall. Age and undergoing dialysis (with or without previous 
      cardiovascular diseases) were positively and significantly associated with linear 
      calcification. Conversely, the absence of atherosclerosis and low levels of 
      C-reactive protein and phosphorus significantly impeded the development of linear 
      calcification. CONCLUSIONS: VC in large, conduit arteries is more prevalent in 
      patients on dialysis than controls and is predominantly located in a linear fashion 
      in the intima of the arteries.

TI  - Reduction in Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity Is Associated with a Short-Term Reduction in 
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density T Score.
PG  - 346-350
LID - 10.1159/000501392 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We wished 
      to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with changes in 
      bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: We measured 
      vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and BMD by dual electron 
      absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to compensate for differences in 
      patient ages and gender. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had repeat aPWV measurements 
      and DXA scans, median 12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased in 15 and increased in 9. As 
      there were more women in the group with an increase in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted 
      DXA T scores Total body T scores fell in both groups, but median T scores remained 
      positive for those with an increase in aPWV, whereas negative T scores on both scans 
      for those with a decrease in or stable aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in those 
      with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to 0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 0.05), 
      whereas there was no significant decrease in those with an increase in aPWV (-0.5 
      [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]). There were no changes in femoral neck T 
      scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothesis of a link between bone 
      disease and vascular disease in dialysis patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging 
      of the aorta and will include aortic calcification, and as such a reduction in 
      lumbar spine T score without a change in femoral neck T score suggests a reduction 
      in aortic calcification. Although our study requires additional confirmation, our 
      data would suggest that changes in aPWV could be used as a surrogate for changes in 
      vascular calcification in the investigation of interventions designed to reduce 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Doppler ultrasound and calcification score: improving vascular access surveillance.
PG  - 1425-9
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2015.1077316 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which increases 
      morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is thrombosis, due to 
      flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. This occurs not only 
      due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones related to vascular 
      atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has developed a simple 
      vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification and arterial 
      stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic procedures for VA 
      surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive power for the detection of 
      stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of systemic factors, especially SCVS, on 
      Qa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained 
      with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated 
      correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were recorded and 
      non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with them. RESULTS: Pearson's 
      corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851 (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied 
      significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p = 0.021), SCVS (p = 0.030), 
      intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa 
      varied significantly with diabetes status (p = 0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA 
      status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time 
      (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters did 
      not change the flow values. CONCLUSION: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower 
      DU-Qas, giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a 
      simple method like SVCS may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations 
      accordingly to risk stratification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have been 
      associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there is no accepted 
      standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications, and most existing methods 
      are simplistic. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a 
      semiquantitative score, one that accounts for all visible calcium on 
      echocardiography, could predict all-cause mortality and stroke in a graded fashion. 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects derived from a 
      general echocardiography database. A global cardiac calcium score (GCCS) was applied 
      that assigned points for calcification in the aortic root and valve, mitral annulus 
      and valve, and submitral apparatus, and points for restricted leaflet mobility. The 
      primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was stroke. 
      RESULTS: Over a mean 3.8 ± 1.7 years of follow-up, there were 116 deaths and 34 
      strokes. Crude mortality increased in a graded fashion with increasing GCCS. In 
      unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, the GCCS was significantly associated with 
      total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.35; P < .0001) and stroke 
      (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = .003). After adjusting for demographic 
      and clinical factors (age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, 
      dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, 
      history of atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke), these associations remained 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: The GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired 
      echocardiograms and has clinically significant associations with total mortality and 
      stroke.

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to 
      exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess 
      characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 
      124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent 
      patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were 
      compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. 
      Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, 
      and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area 
      stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean 
      calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3° 
      vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments 
      (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. 
      There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium 
      >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 
      4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the 
      HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial 
      calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, 
      HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more 
      extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of 
      non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an 
      overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to 
      the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with 
      long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores predict coronary heart disease 
      (CHD) risk. Little is known, however, about the distinctive risk among asymptomatic 
      individuals with very high CAC (≥ 1000) compared to high CAC (400-999). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: We compared CHD risk factors and event rates between participants with very 
      high CAC (n = 257) and high CAC (n = 420) among adults free of clinical CHD in the 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). CAC was measured at baseline, and 
      participants were followed for a median of 68 months. Very high CAC (≥ 1000), 
      compared to high CAC (400-999), was associated with male gender (OR 3.10, p < 0.001) 
      and older age (OR 1.42 per 10 year increase, p < 0.001). Chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) was associated with very high CAC (OR 1.66, p = 0.009) with a greater 
      prevalence of moderate CKD (GFR 30-59) in the ≥ 1000 group (25% vs. 18%). Those with 
      very high CAC were more likely to develop angina (adjusted HR 1.72 [95% CI 
      1.03-2.90], p = 0.04), but not more likely to experience myocardial infarction, 
      resuscitated cardiac arrest, or CHD death (adjusted HR 1.17, [95% CI 0.64-2.12] p = 
      0.61) compared to high CAC. Total CHD event rates were greater for very high CAC 
      (3.7 per 100 person-years) compared to high CAC (2.6 per 100 person-years). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both high and very high CAC are associated with an elevated risk of CHD 
      events in those without symptomatic CHD at baseline; however, very high CAC is 
      associated with an increased risk of angina, but not CHD death or MI, compared to 
      high CAC.

TI  - Aortic arch calcification predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 658-67
LID - 10.1159/000368476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple 
      assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is associated 
      with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted a prospective 
      study to investigate factors associated with the presence at baseline and 
      progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a 
      short-term outcome. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 
      asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 
      2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and 
      biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years. 
      RESULTS: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients 
      (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An 
      increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male patients 
      who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years, 
      multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade 
      calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients 
      with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and the grade of 
      AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates were 
      significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were 
      independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by chest 
      X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD 
      patients.

TI  - The association between the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary calcification 
      may differ depending on kidney function in a healthy population.
PG  - e0185522
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185522 [doi]
LID - e0185522
AB  - BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein B/A-1 ratio has been reported to be one of the 
      strongest risk predictors of cardiovascular events. However, its prognostic value 
      for cardiovascular disease is still uncertain, especially in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease. This study aimed to investigate whether the association between the 
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio and coronary artery calcification differed according to 
      kidney function in a healthy population. METHODS: Of the data from 7,780 
      participants from the medical records database in Gangnam Severance Hospital from 
      2005 through 2016, a cross-sectional analysis included participants with an 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 determined based on 
      the Chronic Kidney Disease -Epidemiology Collaboration equation (n  =  1,800). Mild 
      renal insufficiency was defined as an eGFR of 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Coronary artery 
      calcification measured with computed tomography was defined as an above-zero score. 
      Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between coronary 
      calcification and the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio according to eGFR by adjusting for 
      the influence of confounders. RESULTS: The mean apolipoprotein B/A-I level was 
      significantly higher in the participants with coronary artery calcification than in 
      the participants without coronary artery calcification. The apolipoprotein B/A-I 
      ratio was significantly different according to coronary artery calcification in the 
      participants with normal kidney function, but in the participants with mild renal 
      insufficiency, it was not different. After adjusting for age, male sex, systolic 
      blood pressure, body mass index, current smoking status, and fasting plasma glucose, 
      the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk 
      of coronary artery calcification in participants with normal kidney function (odds 
      ratio = 2.411, p = 0.011), while in the participants with mild renal insufficiency, 
      the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio was not associated with coronary artery 
      calcification. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the predictive value of 
      apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio for coronary artery calcification may differ according to 
      kidney function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate population-based cardiovascular risk scores and coronary 
      artery calcification scores (CACS) in amputees. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study 
      of 1300 veterans in a cardiac computed tomography database. SETTING: 1B Veterans 
      Administration medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 76 amputees and similar 
      number of age-, gender-, and Framingham Risk Scores (FRS)-matched control subjects. 
      METHODS: The amputee population was identified and compared for CACS and traditional 
      cardiac risk factors. Two control groups were used: control group 1, with known risk 
      factors including diabetes mellitus, and control group 2, with all risk factors 
      without diabetes mellitus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical associations between 
      amputee and control group FRS scores, CACS, and other cardiac risk factors were 
      assessed. RESULTS: The study included 57 nontraumatic and 19 traumatic amputees with 
      an average age of 62.4 years. Sixty-six amputees were in the low-to-intermediate 
      cardiac risk groups according to FRS. Despite this classification, the mean CACS 
      were significantly higher in amputees (1285 ± 18) than in either of the control 
      groups: control group 1 (540 ± 84) and control group 2 (481 ± 11), P < .001. CACS 
      also were significantly higher in the nontraumatic subject group (1595 ± 12) 
      compared with the traumatic group (356 ± 57; P < .001). Upon categorization of CACS 
      based on probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), 76% of amputees had a CACS 
      >100 and 38% of amputees had a CACS >1000. Interestingly, CACS were almost the same 
      in finger/toe amputations compared with an above-knee amputation, indicating an 
      already ongoing CAD process irrespective of level of amputation. The predominant 
      clinical significant cardiac risk factors in amputees are hypertension (89.5%), P < 
      .005; chronic kidney disease (31.6%), P < .001; dyslipidemia (72.4%), P < .04; and 
      insulin resistance. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density 
      lipoprotein levels were nonsignificantly low in all amputees. Triglycerides were 
      particularly higher in traumatic patients compared with nontraumatic patients, with 
      the triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio >7. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that amputees have a much greater burden of underlying atherosclerotic 
      disease as detected by CACS than do control subjects matched by Framingham risk 
      stratification. Early screening for CAD and aggressive targeted interventions may be 
      an important part of management to reduce early mortality after amputation.

TI  - Coronary artery, aortic wall, and valvular calcification in nondialyzed individuals 
      with type 2 diabetes and renal disease.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly prevalent 
      and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook this study to test the 
      hypothesis that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often severe long 
      before diabetic renal disease progresses to ESRD. METHODS: A total of 32 nondialyzed 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic renal disease (albumin 
      excretion rate>30 microg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49.8 +/- 6.1 
      mL/min/1.73 m2] were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric 
      diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls without renal 
      disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the presence/absence of 
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: Using 
      electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of coronary artery 
      calcification was significantly greater among diabetic renal disease individuals 
      (prevalence, 94% vs. 59%, P < 0.001; median score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0.001) than the 
      nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification scores were significantly 
      more severe among diabetic renal disease individuals than either the diabetic or 
      nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic renal disease, the coronary 
      artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were several-fold greater 
      among those with known CAD than among those without. There was also a significantly 
      greater prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification among diabetic renal 
      disease individuals than nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23% vs. 6%, P = 0.03; mitral, 
      25% vs. 2%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced 
      these findings and also consistently identified age and diabetic renal disease as 
      additional predictors for the presence or severity of coronary artery and aortic 
      wall calcification. CONCLUSION: In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed 
      individuals with diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that vascular and 
      valvular calcification is present and often severe long before the disease 
      progresses to ESRD. The data also suggest that the coronary artery and aortic wall 
      calcification may represent atherosclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a major component of uremic syndrome, cardiovascular 
      disease is largely responsible for the high mortality observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have evidenced an association between serum 
      levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and vascular 
      alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum 
      IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a cohort of CKD 
      patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: One-hundred and thirty-nine 
      patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at different stages of CKD (8% at 
      stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at stage 5, and 32% at stage 5D) 
      were enrolled. RESULTS: Baseline IS levels presented an inverse relationship with 
      renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification and pulse wave 
      velocity. During the follow-up period (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly 
      because of cardiovascular events (n = 18). In crude survival analyses, the highest 
      IS tertile was a powerful predictor of overall and cardiovascular mortality (P = 
      0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The predictive power of IS for death was maintained 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, albumin, hemoglobin, phosphate, and 
      aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: The study presented here indicates that IS may 
      have a significant role in the vascular disease and higher mortality observed in CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Aberrant activation of Wnt pathways in arteries associates with vascular 
      calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1007/s11255-016-1291-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Development of vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leads to increased cardiovascular 
      morbidity and mortality. The mechanism of vascular calcification in CKD patients 
      remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical association between 
      abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification in ESRD patients. 
      METHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples of 
      radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous fistula surgery. Expression of 
      Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association 
      between Wnt activities and vascular calcification rates. RESULTS: 
      Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that increased expressions of β-catenin, 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed in the subjects with vascular 
      calcification. Further correlation analysis identified that β-catenin expression in 
      overall arterial samples was significantly associated with the expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also found significant correlation between expressions of 
      GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis demonstrated that Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular 
      calcification in patients with ESRD. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased 
      activation of Wnt pathways in the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is 
      significantly correlated with the incidence of vascular calcification. These 
      findings support Wnt pathways as a potential target for future therapy of vascular 
      calcification in CKD.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and chronically decreased GFR in living kidney donors.
PG  - 143-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the presence of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the risk 
      of morbidity and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased 
      markedly. Increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) is proposed as a 
      pathogenetic link between CVD and chronic kidney disease. We examined the frequency 
      and severity of CAC in living kidney donors to test the hypothesis that decreased 
      GFR is associated with increased CAC. METHODS: We used multidetector spiral computed 
      tomography to examine CAC in 101 living kidney donors and 99 age- and sex-matched 
      healthy control subjects without diabetes and a history of coronary artery disease. 
      The extent of calcification was measured by means of the Agatston score. GFR was 
      calculated by using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. 
      The frequency of risk factors for coronary artery disease was compared in kidney 
      donors and controls, and the relation between kidney donors' clinical 
      characteristics and the presence or absence of CAC was examined. RESULTS: CAC 
      frequency and mean calcification scores were similar between kidney donors (13.9%; 
      4.5 +/- 22.6) and controls (17.2%; 13.2 +/- 89.2). CAC was not associated with 
      decreased GFR, and the correlation between CAC and GFR was not statistically 
      significant. Kidney donors with calcification were more likely to be older (P = 
      0.003) and male (P = 0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted analysis showed an association 
      between greater parathormone levels (odds ratio, 1.023; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.001 to 1.045; P = 0.037) and CAC in kidney donors. CONCLUSION: A mild decrease in 
      GFR without the presence of diabetes does not seem to be associated with increased 
      CAC. These findings need to be confirmed in different and larger study populations.

PG  - 1717-1722
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2016060651 [doi]
AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. The 
      ability of MGP to inhibit calcification requires the activity of a vitamin 
      K-dependent enzyme, which mediates MGP carboxylation. We investigated how MGP 
      carboxylation influences the risk of calciphylaxis in adult patients receiving 
      dialysis and examined the effects of vitamin K deficiency on MGP carboxylation. Our 
      study included 20 patients receiving hemodialysis with calciphylaxis (cases) and 20 
      patients receiving hemodialysis without calciphylaxis (controls) matched for age, 
      sex, race, and warfarin use. Cases had higher plasma levels of uncarboxylated MGP 
      (ucMGP) and carboxylated MGP (cMGP) than controls. However, the fraction of total 
      MGP that was carboxylated (relative cMGP concentration = cMGP/[cMGP + uncarboxylated 
      MGP]) was lower in cases than in controls (0.58±0.02 versus 0.69±0.03, respectively; 
      P=0.003). In patients not taking warfarin, cases had a similarly lower relative cMGP 
      concentration. Each 0.1 unit reduction in relative cMGP concentration associated 
      with a more than two-fold increase in calciphylaxis risk. Vitamin K deficiency 
      associated with lower relative cMGP concentration in multivariable adjusted analyses 
      (β=-8.99; P=0.04). In conclusion, vitamin K deficiency-mediated reduction in 
      relative cMGP concentration may have a role in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis. 
      Whether vitamin K supplementation can prevent and/or treat calciphylaxis requires 
      further study.

TI  - Vascular calcifications, arterial aging and arterial remodeling in ESRD.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1159/000345172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated arterial aging and inadequate outward arterial remodeling 
      are observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Whether these changes could 
      be closely associated with arterial calcifications has never been investigated. 
      METHODS: 155 ESRD patients and 105 age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched control 
      subjects were included. Common carotid artery (CCA) pressure, diameter, intima-media 
      thickness, elastic modulus, and presence of calcified plaques were measured 
      ultrasonographically. Carotid artery stiffness was determined from simultaneously 
      recorded CCA diameter and stroke changes in diameter and CCA pressure waveforms, 
      obtained by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, ESRD 
      patients had increased CCA systolic and pulse pressures (p < 0.001), larger CCA 
      diameter (p < 0.001) and CCA intima-media thickness (p < 0.01) and similar CCA 
      relative wall thickness. In ESRD patients the arterial remodeling was associated 
      with increased CCA elastic modulus/stiffness (p < 0.001). In ESRD patients the 
      association between CCA elastic modulus and age was characterized by a steeper slope 
      (p = 0.03), but after separation of uremic patients according to the presence of 
      calcifications, the accelerated aging was observed only in calcified subjects. 
      Despite higher CCA systolic and pulse pressures, the CCA relative wall thickness was 
      similar to controls indicating an inadequate pressure-associated remodeling. 
      Moreover, the positive systolic pressure/relative thickness correlation observed in 
      control subjects was lost with paradoxical negative correlation in calcified ESRD 
      patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in ESRD patients, 
      accelerated arterial aging and inadequate arterial hypertrophy are closely 
      associated with the calcifications of arterial walls. Inadequate hypertrophy is 
      responsible for high circumferential stress applied on the vessels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and 
      distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium 
      scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT of 
      the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56 women 
      with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate semiquantitative 
      score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and morphology for the 
      common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The operative and 
      clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial segment was used for 
      anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether delayed graft function 
      (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using 
      the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for 
      each calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly 
      higher average calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all 
      categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of 
      higher scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, 
      hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the 
      calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was 
      independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of 
      the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT 
      evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival after 
      transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis 
      was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine 
      pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with 
      diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to 
      optimize outcomes.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 exacerbate arterial stiffening and angiogenesis in 
      diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 494-504
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvp242 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are the prominent risk factors of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 regulate 
      vascular structure by degrading elastic fibre and inhibit angiogenesis by generating 
      angiostatin. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and -9 were up-regulated in the arterial 
      vasculature from CKD patients with diabetes, compared with those without diabetes. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: During living donor transplantation procedures, arteries from 
      donors (n = 8) and recipients (non-diabetic, n = 8; diabetic, n = 8; matched in age, 
      gender, and dialysis treatments) were harvested. Diabetic arteries had increased 
      MMP-2 and -9 activities by 42 and 116% compared with non-diabetic ones. Diabetic 
      arteries were the stiffest, and the stiffness measurement was highly correlated with 
      the summation of MMP-2 + MMP-9 activities (r = 0.738, P = 0.0002). Pulse wave 
      velocity measurements correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.683, P = 0.005). Elastic 
      fibre degradation and calcification were worst in diabetic vessels. The phosphate 
      level, which was 25% higher in diabetic patients, correlated with MMP activity (r = 
      0.513, P = 0.04) and in vitro stiffness (r = 0.545, P = 0.03), respectively. 
      Angiostatin expression was doubled, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was 
      50% reduced in diabetic compared with non-diabetic vessels. Microvascular density in 
      diabetic vessels was 48% of that in non-diabetic ones, and it was strongly 
      associated with MMP activity (r = -0.792, P < 0.0001) and vasorelaxation (r = 0.685, 
      P = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: Using a matched case-control design, we report 
      up-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 in diabetic CKD arteries and correlate those with 
      stiffening, impaired angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings may 
      help to explain the high susceptibility of CVD in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD 
      patients.

TI  - Plaque surface irregularity and calcification length within carotid plaque predict 
      secondary events in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 29-34
LID - S0021-9150(16)31476-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.11.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although comprehensive risk factor modification is recommended, 
      a uniform management strategy does not necessarily prevent secondary events in 
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, identification of high-risk 
      patients who may benefit from more intensive interventions may improve prognosis. 
      Carotid ultrasound can reliably identify systemic atherosclerosis, and carotid 
      plaque and intima-media thickness (IMT) are known independent risk factors for CAD. 
      However, it is unclear whether findings on carotid ultrasound can improve prediction 
      of secondary CAD events. METHODS: The study population comprised 146 consecutive 
      patients with CAD (mean age, 66 ± 9 years; 126 with angina pectoris, 20 with acute 
      myocardial infarction). IMT, plaque score, plaque area, plaque surface irregularity, 
      and calcification length (calculated by summing the calcified lesions within each 
      plaque accompanied by acoustic shadow) were measured at baseline. Patients were 
      followed for 10 years to ascertain secondary CAD events defined as hard major 
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction) 
      and as total MACE (hard MACE and angina pectoris with coronary revascularization). 
      RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that calcification length 
      (p < 0.05) and plaque surface irregularity (p < 0.01) remained independently 
      associated with total MACE after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, 
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, smoking, and multivessel CAD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the combination of calcification length and 
      plaque surface irregularity has additional value beyond traditional risk 
      classification. Intensive intervention for these high-risk patients may avoid or 
      delay progression of atherosclerosis towards secondary CAD events.

AB  - It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are 
      simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone 
      health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney 
      disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of 
      microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery 
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture of 
      the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography 
      (HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar 
      spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery calcification using 
      multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured in 66 patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of bone turnover, vitamin D 
      status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were assessed. CAC score was found to 
      be <100 in 39% and ≥100 in 61% of patients. The median [95% CI] total CAC score was 
      282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis, significant correlations between CAC and age 
      (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3, p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, 
      p<0.01) were found, and parameters of bone microarchitecture were numerically but 
      not significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100. In multivariate analysis 
      stratifying for gender and correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone 
      volume/total volume (BV/TV) were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores 
      ≥100 (p<0.05 for both). Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone 
      density are associated with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.

TI  - FGF-23 and osteoprotegerin are independently associated with myocardial damage in 
      chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Another link between chronic kidney 
      disease-mineral bone disorder and the heart.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-skeletal calcification and disordered phosphate metabolism are 
      hallmarks of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are increased in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and have been associated with arterial and cardiac dysfunction and 
      reduced survival. Troponin T (cTnT) is released from cardiac myocytes under 
      conditions of stress and is predictive of mortality across a range of renal 
      functions. However, the utility of this biomarker was formerly limited by the lower 
      limit of assay detection. The introduction of a high-sensitivity assay has enabled 
      more detailed study of myocyte stress below the previous limit of detection. We 
      studied the association of mediators of CKD-MBD with arterial stiffness and also of 
      these mediators and arterial stiffness with myocardial damage in patients with CKD 
      stages 3-4. METHODS: OPG and FGF-23 were measured in 200 CKD stages 3-4 patients. 
      cTnT was measured using a high-sensitivity assay. Aortic stiffness was assessed 
      using aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV). RESULTS: Mean age was 69 ± 11 years, mean 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 151 ± 22/81 ± 11 mmHg and renal function 
      was 33 ± 11 mL/min/1.73 m(2). OPG, FGF-23, high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) and 
      APWV all correlated with renal function. After multivariate analysis, OPG and age 
      remained independently associated with aortic stiffness. OPG and FGF-23 were 
      independently associated with hs-cTnT in addition to other non-traditional risk 
      factors (Model R(2) = 0.596). CONCLUSION: We have shown that changes in bone 
      mediators and phosphate metabolism induced by CKD are independently associated with 
      vascular and cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Our findings suggest that cardiac 
      dysfunction may be specifically associated with such abnormalities in addition to 
      recognized increases in vascular stiffness.

TI  - Soft tissue calcification in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - Soft tissue calcification is a recognized complication of uremia in adult patients 
      and has been implicated as a cause of ischemic necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and 
      respiratory failure. However, soft tissue calcification has been regarded as rare in 
      pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to pulmonary calcinosis in an 
      adolescent after renal transplantation, we retrospectively reviewed clinical, 
      biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients with uremia, on dialysis, or following 
      renal transplantation cared for at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 
      1983. Soft tissue calcification was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). 
      Forty-three patients (36 percent) had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most 
      frequent sites of mineral deposition were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, 
      coronary artery, central nervous system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification 
      was uniformly accompanied by deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had 
      small amounts of focal calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue 
      calcification (Group C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of 
      vitamin D or its analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak 
      calcium x phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were 
      jointly associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest 
      independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was 
      greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol and 
      vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum calcium 
      at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were not 
      statistically associated with calcinosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Arterial location-specific calcification at the carotid artery and aortic arch for 
      chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
PG  - 267-74
LID - 10.1007/s00223-014-9891-2 [doi]
AB  - Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but 
      controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and dyslipidemia in 
      altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three different arterial 
      locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid artery (ICA) origins. 
      Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and its orifices were 
      evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed tomography angiography in 397 
      patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, gender, CKD, DM, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking status. Additionally, subgroup 
      analyses in each variable were conducted. Our multivariate logistic regression 
      analyses revealed that CKD was significantly associated with the outside-wall 
      calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM was only associated with the 
      inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased the 
      association between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its 
      orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was significantly 
      associated with the calcification at the orifices of the aortic arch branches 
      synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have any significant association with 
      calcification in any of the three vascular beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk 
      of calcification in common with the three different vascular beds. CKD in 
      combination with DM, as well as hypertension in combination with CKD, were key 
      relationships affecting the risk of arterial calcification, especially at the aortic 
      arch and its orifices.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene promoter 
      polymorphisms are associated with mortality in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2207-12
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major causes 
      of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a 
      family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in 
      atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of 
      atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G) and 
      MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery 
      calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) 
      and all-cause mortality risk in HD. METHODS: Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up 
      for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD 
      patients' characteristics were age 64 +/- 13 years, males 64%, diabetic 24%, 
      hypertensive 62%, smokers 38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all undergoing standard HD thrice 
      weekly. RESULTS: ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G/2G and 
      6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was 
      associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, diabetes, 
      hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage 
      and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for 
      the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 
      3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity 
      significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 
      (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first 
      time that MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors 
      for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. 
      These data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis 
      of the increased mortality in HD patients.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification and atherosclerosis at the initiation of hemodialysis 
      in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 360-9
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery 
      calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship 
      between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was 
      to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with 
      ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC 
      and CAP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using 
      multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, 
      respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence 
      of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were 
      also evaluated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found 
      in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, 
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria 
      and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with 
      age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the 
      multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and 
      calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant 
      for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio 
      (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high 
      OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). CONCLUSION: Both CAAC and CAP 
      were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk 
      factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be 
      an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong 
      relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on 
      vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels 
      between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the 
      relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, 
      and the mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred 
      forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 
      [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels 
      of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) 
      had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean 
      follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments 
      (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, 
      hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an 
      independent predictor of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and 
      insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected 
      mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D 
      may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be 
      further explored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement 
      of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication 
      cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including 
      changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are 
      nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: Dialysis 
      patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 
      2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the 
      time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical 
      outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve 
      dialysis patients. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age 
      was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of 
      cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 
      27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium 
      (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) 
      (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), 
      calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin 
      (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular 
      events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality 
      rate of 19% (n = 13). CONCLUSION: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet 
      withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium 
      and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peritoneal calcification (PC) is a specific finding in patients 
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but its prevalence, risk factors, and impacts 
      in PD patients remain unclear. The present study investigated these issues and 
      provided information useful for the management of PC. METHODS: The study included 
      183 PD patients. The severity of PC was determined using abdominal computed 
      tomography (CT), and we summed up all scores from slices obtained from the diaphragm 
      to the pelvic floor normalized to body surface area. We analyzed the associations 
      between PC and demographic and clinical characteristics, and between PC and levels 
      of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegrin and fetuin-A. The 
      determinants of PC were examined using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Patients were categorized into group 1 (without PC, n = 133) and group 2 (with PC, 
      n = 50). Group 2 patients showed different degrees of PC with a mean of 160±769 
      mm(2)/m(2). Group 1 patients had higher fetuin-A levels than group 2 patients 
      (861±309 vs. 760±210 µg/mL; p = 0.021). The independent risk factors for the 
      presence of PC included male gender, previous peritonitis, and PD adequacy (KT/V). 
      Further analysis performed in group 2 patients showed that the dosage of vitamin D, 
      serum levels of CRP, and dialysate calcium load were the independent determinants of 
      PC. However, the presence of PC did not affect patients' technique survival, 
      peritonitis incidence, or mortality in the mean follow up period of 28±12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence and severity of PC were associated with inflammation, 
      peritoneal KT/V, and mineral metabolism. The impact of PC on the outcomes of PD 
      patients requires further study with a longer follow-up.

TI  - Association of kidney function and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein: data from the 
      Heart and Soul Study.
PG  - 2095-101
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in persons with chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) and predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Matrix Gla 
      protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, and lower levels of 
      its precursor-uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP)--are associated with vascular calcification 
      and atherosclerosis. Whether mild to moderate decrements in kidney function are 
      associated with lower serum ucMGP is unknown. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 
      among 842 outpatients with stable CVD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
      serum cystatin-C and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) were measured and serum 
      ucMGP levels were determined by ELISA. Multivariate linear regression evaluated the 
      association of each kidney function measure with serum ucMGP levels. RESULTS: The 
      mean eGFR was 76 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 186 subjects (22%) had moderate CKD 
      (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The mean +/- SD ucMGP level was 3289 +/- 1177 nM. In 
      unadjusted analysis, each 10 mL/ min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 101 nM 
      lower ucMGP level. This association was only minimally attenuated in final 
      multivariate models wherein each 10 mL/ min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 
      79 nM lower ucMGP (95% confidence interval [CI]; 44 to 115; P < 0.001) after 
      adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, 
      hypertension, diabetes; and serum albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and fetuin-A levels. 
      Similarly, in models adjusted for identical covariates, each 0.1 mg/L higher 
      cystatin-C was associated with 39 nM lower ucMGP (95% CI 23 to 55; P < 0.001). In 
      contrast, no significant association was observed between ACR and ucMGP in either 
      unadjusted or adjusted analyses (adjusted P = 0.17). All associations were similar 
      among subjects with or without diabetes (P-values for interaction > 0.50). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with stable CVD, a reduced glomerular filtration rate 
      is associated with a decreased serum ucMGP level. In contrast, ACR is not associated 
      with ucMGP levels. Whether ucMGP is a useful marker of vascular calcification and 
      CVD event risk in persons with CKD deserves future study.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and fetuin A are independent predictors for the coronary 
      artery disease extent in mild chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1780-6
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02560310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
      explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by uremia-specific 
      factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors involved in its 
      regulation, and in the vascular calcification process. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In an unselected population of 177 patients with 
      calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), the link between the 
      mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product), 
      regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH], intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin A), and the severity of coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary angiography were evaluated in three 
      subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini lesion severity score. RESULTS: The mean 
      serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population was 28.1 ± 17.3 RU/ml and for 
      fetuin A was 473.1 ± 156.2 μg/ml. Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had 
      significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; 
      arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. 
      After the adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk 
      factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini 
      score. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with 
      mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels 
      appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for 
      extent of CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of 
      mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of 
      studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant recipients, 
      and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft 
      prognosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal 
      transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We 
      established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before 
      transplantation. We analyzed the impact of calcification in graft and patient 
      survival, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal 
      function, and mineral metabolism. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) 
      before renal transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical 
      differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass 
      index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to 
      first 2 years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft 
      survival in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In 
      line with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and 
      cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P = 
      .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent predictor 
      for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time of 
      transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after renal 
      transplantation.

      atherosclerosis in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains excessive in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. The association of vascular changes with regulators of 
      extraosseous calcification in this patient population is still under investigation. 
      The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of the 
      calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor osteoprotegerin 
      (OPG) with vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: In this 
      cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic hemodialysis patients, we measured 
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) with applanation tonometry, 
      reflecting arterial stiffness, and common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a 
      surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as serum levels of fetuin-A and OPG. 
      Co-morbidities, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory markers and 
      mineral-bone disease serology parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: cfPWV 
      correlated inversely with fetuin-A (r=-0.355, p=0.001) and positively with OPG 
      (r=0.584, p<0.001). In multilinear regression analysis including age, gender, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pulse pressure, LDL, logCRP, both 
      fetuin-A and OPG were independently associated with cfPWV (p=0.024 and p=0.041 
      respectively). ccIMT was negatively associated with fetuin-A (r=-0.312, p=0.005) and 
      positively with OPG (r=0.521, p<0.0001); however these associations lost statistical 
      significance after adjustment for age. CONCLUSION: In chronic hemodialysis patients 
      both fetuin-A and OPG levels are independently associated with arterial stiffness 
      but not with early atherosclerotic vascular changes.

TI  - Association of bone turnover markers and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD).
PG  - 1127-32
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2011.01.016 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased 
      vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation of the 
      calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains unclear. We 
      investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors 
      (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone; 
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD 
      patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged 
      (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover markers (bone-specific 
      alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and 
      MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), 
      femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was 
      assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a 
      significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, 
      p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were 
      seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) 
      and SI(DVP) independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant 
      relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A 
      significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SI(DVP) in CKD 
      stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following 
      correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data 
      suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in 
      pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical 
      usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD.

TI  - Cardiac disease in young adult patients with end-stage renal disease since 
      childhood: a Dutch cohort study.
PG  - 1058-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death in patients 
      with pediatric end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Yet, few data exist on cardiac 
      function in these patients. We assessed the extent of cardiac abnormality and 
      analyzed its association with potential determinants in young adult patients with 
      pediatric ESRD in a long-term follow-up study. METHODS: All Dutch living adult 
      patients with ESRD onset at age of 0 to 14 years between 1972 and 1992 were invited 
      for echocardiography and blood pressure assessment. Special attention was paid to 
      evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, and aortic 
      valve calcification. We collected data on determinants by review of all medical 
      charts. RESULTS: Of all the 187 living patients, 140 participated in the study. Of 
      those, 110 patients had received a transplant and 30 patients were on dialysis. Mean 
      age was 29.2 (20.7 to 41.8) years. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) exceeded 150 
      g/m2 in 47% of all male patients and 120 g/m2 in 39% of all female patients, both 
      consistent with LVH. Diastolic dysfunction, defined as an early over atrial 
      transmitral blood flow velocity (E/A ratio) <1, was found in 18 (13%) patients; 27 
      (19%) had aortic valve calcification. Multiple regression analysis revealed the 
      following: a high LVMI was associated with a current high blood pressure (beta=0.46, 
      P < 0.001) and male gender (beta=0.21, P=0.009), a low E/A ratio with aging 
      (beta=-0.28, P < 0.001) and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <25 mL/min/1.73 m2 
      (beta=-0.29, P < 0.001), and aortic valve calcification with prolonged peritoneal 
      dialysis (beta=0.36, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Young adult patients with pediatric 
      ESRD are at risk for LVH caused by hypertension and for aortic valve calcification. 
      Diastolic function decreases with age and is enhanced by a current low GFR. 
      Prolonged peritoneal dialysis may enhance aortic valve calcification.

TI  - A simple vascular calcification score predicts cardiovascular risk in haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 1480-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients and have been recently associated with vascular 
      calcifications. The objective of our study was to assess the value of a simple 
      vascular calcification score for the prediction of cardiovascular death, 
      cardiovascular hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in HD 
      patients, and to correlate this score with cardiovascular disease and with other 
      known predictors of vascular disease. METHODS: In this observational, prospective 
      study 123 chronic HD patients (75 males and 48 females; 20% diabetic) were included, 
      who were on low-flux HD treatment for 46.6+/-52 months (mean+/-SD). We set up a 
      simple vascular calcification score based on plain radiographic films of pelvis and 
      hands. Brachial pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and 
      cardiovascular events and hospitalization episodes were assessed. RESULTS: During an 
      observational period of 37 months there were 17 cardiovascular deaths; 28 patients 
      needed cardiovascular hospitalizations and 32 patients suffered fatal and non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 43 patients (35%), 
      peripheral arterial disease in 33 patients (26.8%), cerebrovascular disease in 16 
      patients (13%) and vascular disease (coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial 
      disease or cerebral vascular disease) in 61 patients (49.6%). By binary logistic 
      regression, diabetes (P = 0.01), male sex (P<0.001), age (P = 0.02), HD duration (P 
      = 0.02) and MAP (P = 0.03) were independently associated with a vascular score > or 
      =3. This score > or =3 was independently associated with coronary artery disease (P 
      = 0.008), peripheral arterial disease (P<0.001) and vascular disease (P = 0.001). 
      Patients with a vascular calcification score > or =3 had a 3.9-fold higher risk of 
      cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.03), a 2.8-fold higher risk of cardiovascular 
      hospitalizations (P = 0.02) and a 2.3-fold higher risk of fatal or non-fatal 
      cardiovascular events (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The present vascular calcification 
      scoring represents a simple tool for the assessment of cardiovascular risk related 
      with vascular calcifications in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and matrix-metalloproteinases in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease: are they associated with cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 276-83
LID - 10.1159/000243050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      may be related to mineral disorder and microinflammation. Fibroblast growth factor 
      23 (FGF-23) is a phosphatonin and inhibitor of calcitriol synthesis, which is 
      associated with poor prognosis in CKD patients starting dialysis. 
      Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) contribute to myocardial remodeling and 
      arterial calcification. FGF-23 and MMPs levels are altered in CKD, however, little 
      is known about their association and relation to cardiovascular (CV) disease. 
      METHODS: Standard laboratory parameters, plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, FGF-23, 
      PAPP-A and CV disease history were assessed in 80 patients with CKD 1-5 and 44 
      healthy control subjects. RESULTS: FGF-23 and MMP-2 (assessed by ELISA) were higher 
      in CKD patients compared to controls. FGF-23 increased from CKD 3, whereas MMP-2 
      increased only in CKD 5. FGF-23 was positively associated with MMP-2, adjusted to 
      age, eGFR, phosphatemia, calcitriol and parathormone. FGF-23 independently 
      correlated with parathormone and inversely with calcitriol, whereas MMP-2 was 
      related to phosphatemia. FGF-23 was higher in subjects with a history of CV disease 
      compared to those free of such history (559.0 vs.184.0 RU/ml), adjusted to age and 
      eGFR. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a possible relationship between FGF-23, MMP-2 and 
      CV disease in CKD. Potential causality of this association remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Correlates of osteoprotegerin and association with aortic pulse wave velocity in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2612-9
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03910411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
      resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and 
      stiffness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured in 
      351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic 
      Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured 
      by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression 
      was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular 
      risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave 
      velocity. RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female 
      gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was 
      not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum 
      phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with 
      concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG 
      were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for 
      demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors 
      such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, 
      presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or 
      after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness 
      independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk 
      factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major 
      complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) 
      is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between 
      vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by 
      cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality. METHODS: In 231 ESRD 
      patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, 
      prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney 
      transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were 
      quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of 
      total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were 
      also analysed. RESULTS: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more 
      often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 
      and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) 
      after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox 
      proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause 
      mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and 
      subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) 
      showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly 
      associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from 
      DXA. CONCLUSIONS: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of 
      agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than 
      those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with 
      high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an 
      important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

TI  - Integration of clinical and imaging data to predict death in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 12-8

AB  - In a prior publication, we demonstrated that a model integrating clinical and simple 
      imaging data predicted the presence and severity of coronary artery calcification in 
      prevalent hemodialysis patients. Herein we report the ability of the same model to 
      predict all-cause death. We assessed all-cause mortality in 141 consecutive 
      maintenance hemodialysis patients from two dialysis centers followed for a median of 
      79 months from enrollment. Patients were risk stratified according to a simple 
      cardiovascular calcification index (CCI) that included patient's age, dialysis 
      vintage, calcification of the cardiac valves, and abdominal aorta. The mean 
      patients' age was 55 ± 14 years. Abdominal aorta calcification was present in 57% of 
      the patients, and 44% and 38% had aortic and mitral valve calcification, 
      respectively. During follow-up, 75 deaths (93 deaths per 1000 person-years) were 
      recorded. The CCI was linearly associated with risk of death, such that the 
      unadjusted hazard risk (HR) increased by 12% for each point increase in CCI (P < 
      0.001). Further adjustments for age, sex, study center, diabetes mellitus, history 
      of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular

      simple clinical model that can be used to risk stratify maintenance hemodialysis 
      patients.

AB  - Data regarding characteristics of young patients with mitral annular calcification 
      (MAC) and its associations with other cardiovascular risk factors are scarce. Hence, 
      we sought to characterize patients aged <50 years with MAC and to examine whether in 
      these patients, MAC is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Consecutive 
      patients who underwent an echocardiographic study were prospectively entered into a 
      database. The database included clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic 
      parameters. The present study included 56 patients aged <50 years with a diagnosis 
      of MAC. The mean age was 44.2 ± 6.9 years with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1. The 
      prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (30 patients [53%] hypertension, 17 
      patients [30%] diabetes mellitus, 24 patients [43%] dyslipidemia, 22 patients [39%] 
      smoking) and established cardiovascular disease (22 patients [39%] coronary artery 
      disease, 11 patients [19%] previous stroke) was substantially higher than expected 
      for this age group. Twenty-nine patients (52%) had chronic kidney disease. Of these, 
      18 patients (62%) had end-stage kidney disease and 7 patients (24%) underwent renal 
      transplantation. Fourteen patients (25%) and 3 patients (5%) had moderate or severe 
      mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis, respectively. Aortic valve disease was 
      present in 37 patients (66%). Moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction and 
      left ventricular hypertrophy were identified in 9 patients (16%) and 31 patients 
      (56%), respectively. In conclusion, the detection of MAC in a young patient should 
      be regarded as a marker of atherosclerotic disease, chronic kidney disease, and 
      aortic valve disease.

TI  - Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium score: 
      comparison between transplantation and dialysis.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent 
      ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences 
      between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity 
      of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately 
      in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, 
      divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; 
      previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 
      mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 
      5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by 
      cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of 
      divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) 
      and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary 
      calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three 
      calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with 
      age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 
      0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a 
      correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other 
      markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression 
      analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and 
      C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most 
      predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age 
      and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk 
      condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as 
      compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition 
      proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower 
      prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating 
      role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary 
      calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value 
      to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular 
      lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a cardiovascular risk 
      marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is known about its role in patients 
      with higher cardiovascular risk profile such as chronic kidney disease. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the relationship between EAT and several 
      cardiovascular surrogate markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial 
      stiffness and atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: A 
      total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional 
      study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography, arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and 
      carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode doppler ultrasonography. 
      RESULTS: Mean age was 59 ± 13 years and time on hemodialysis 75 ± 44 months. Twenty 
      percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean EAT volume was 62.6 ± 26.8 cm(3)/m(2). 
      Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased across the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated 
      with age, female gender, body mass index, albumin and lipid parameters. 
      Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values were positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume 
      was significantly higher in patients with CACs >10 compared to the patients with 
      CACs ≤10. Despite the univariate associations between EAT and cardiovascular 
      surrogate markers, only age, body mass index and total cholesterol levels were 
      associated with EAT in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: In prevalent hemodialysis 
      patients, EAT is correlated with atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the 
      presence of CAC. However, this correlation is not independent of other risk factors.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular 
      calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this 
      population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple 
      cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, 
      we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness 
      in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children 
      with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children 
      age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured, and Doppler 
      ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the peak systolic 
      velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) 
      arteries were recorded in the study patients. There were significantly lower serum 
      Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the controls (1.7 ± 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 
      ± 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the 
      aorta and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 ± 0.07 mm vs. 
      0.40 ± 0.09 mm; 0.98 ± 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 ± 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, 
      respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding the PSV of 
      the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study patients and the controls 
      (P >0.05). A negative correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT 
      (AIMT) (r = -0.682; P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was 
      found between the AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 
      0.025, 0.472, P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were 
      associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our 
      results warrants further study.

AB  - The cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary calcification have been 
      extensively studied while those related to tibial artery calcium are less well 
      defined. We sought to determine the associations between cardiovascular risk factors 
      and tibial artery calcification in a cohort of patients with and without significant 
      peripheral atherosclerosis. A total of 222 patients without end-stage renal disease 
      were identified in a prospectively maintained database containing tibial artery 
      calcification (TAC) scores, and demographic, cardiovascular, and biochemical risk 
      factor information. Patients with prevalent tibial artery calcification were more 
      likely to be older, male, and have a history positive for hypertension, 
      hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients with an abnormal ankle-brachial 
      index (ABI) or symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were also more likely to 
      have higher calcium values. In analyses using multivariable logistic regression, 
      age, gender, diabetes, and tobacco use maintained their association with prevalent 
      tibial calcification while hypertension, hyperlipidemia and body mass index did not. 
      These associations remained when PAD was added to the model. After adjusting for 
      relevant cardiovascular risk factors, we found that only abnormal ABI, current PAD 
      symptoms, and lower serum calcium values were associated with the presence of tibial 
      artery calcification. In conclusion, in patients without end-stage renal disease, 
      tibial artery calcification has risk factors that are similar but not identical to 
      those for coronary artery calcification and peripheral atherosclerosis.

      on hemodialysis.
PG  - 260-5
LID - S0066-782X2011005000027 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis present an increased risk of cardiovascular 
      death. Intimal media thickness (IMT) and presence of arterial calcifications are 
      well-known risk factors for cardiovascular death in hemodialysis patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of IMT and arterial calcifications in HD 
      patients and to correlate image findings with clinical and laboratory data. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study involving 75 patients on dialysis for >12 months. Patients 
      underwent B-mode ultrasound scan (US) for determination of IMT of the distal third 
      of the common carotid arteries. Arterial calcifications were assessed by US of 
      carotids, femoral and tibial arteries, and labeled positive if calcification was 
      found in any arterial site. RESULTS: Patients were 52±13 years old, 57% were males 
      and 16% were diabetics. IMT > 0.9 mm was found in 57% of cases and arterial 
      calcifications at US in 48%. Aging (decades) and smoking were associated with both 
      increased IMT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, p < 0.001; aOR = 4.4, p = 0.045, 
      respectively) and presence of vascular calcifications (aOR = 3.0, p < 0.001; aOR = 
      6.8, p = 0.011, respectively). High intact parathyroid hormone levels (per each 100 
      pg/ml) were significantly associated with increased IMT (aOR = 1.7, p = 0.021), but 
      not with vascular calcification. In contrast, Diabetes and time on dialysis (years) 
      were significant determinants for calcifications at US (aOR = 15.0, p = 0.009; aOR = 
      1.39, p = 0.020), but not for increased IMT. CONCLUSION: Increased IMT and 
      calcifications at US are common findings in hemodialysis patients. Aging and smoking 
      are consistent determinants for both image alterations. Parathyroid hormone 
      elevation is associated with increased IMT. Diabetes and time on dialysis 
      substantially increase the risk for arterial calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicated that phosphorus emerged as an important 
      cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The fact 
      that serum phosphorus was closely linked to vascular and valvar calcification may 
      account for one important reason. However, left ventricular remodeling may also 
      serve as another potential mechanism of the cardiac toxicity of phosphorus. In the 
      present study, we evaluated the association of serum phosphorus with left 
      ventricular remodeling. METHODS: We investigated consecutive hospitalized patients 
      with pre-dialysis CKD, who did not have symptomatic heart failure or take any 
      phosphorus binder or calcitriol medications. Transthoracic echocardiography was 
      applied to assess their left ventricular remodeling indices, both structural and 
      functional. RESULTS: The 296 study subjects (mean age 56.4years) included 169 
      (57.1%) men, 203 (68.6%) hypertensive patients. In addition to gender, systolic 
      blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum phosphorus was an 
      independent determinant of left ventricular mass index (LVMI, P=0.001). Similarly, 
      serum phosphorus was also a determinant of left ventricular end diastolic dimension 
      (P=0.0003), but not of relative wall thickness. In multivariate logistic analyses, 
      serum phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with the prevalence 
      of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, odds ratio [OR] 2.38 for each 1mmol/L 
      increase, 95% CI 1.20-4.75, P=0.01). Moreover, the association was only confirmatory 
      in eccentric LVH (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.43-6.32, P=0.003) but not in concentric LVH 
      (1.38, 95% CI, 0.54-3.49, P=0.50). CONCLUSION: Serum phosphorus was significantly 
      and independently associated with LVMI and the prevalence of eccentric LVH in 
      hospitalized patients with CKD.

TI  - Early calcification of renal allografts detected by protocol biopsies: causes and 
      clinical implications.
PG  - 1934-41
AB  - Interstitial calcification has been described in renal allografts, however, the 
      etiology and significance of this finding for the graft are unclear. The aim of this 
      study was to examine calcification in serial protocol biopsies, to test the 
      hypothesis that calcification is related to parameters of calcium homeostasis in 
      these patients and to analyze a possible relation between calcification and graft 
      function at 1 year. We studied 213 patients with 586 protocol biopsies obtained 6 
      weeks, 3 and 6 months after transplantation. Calcifications increased over time, 
      from 6.1% at 6 weeks to 17.8% at 6 months. Out of the 213 patients, 56 had 
      calcification in one or more biopsies. Patients age and gender, underlying renal 
      disease, dialysis mode and duration, previous transplantations, donor type, age and 
      gender, HLA matches and ischemia time had no influence on calcification. 
      Calcification was not related to rejection episodes, acute tubular lesions, 
      calcineurin inhibitor toxicity or tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. 
      Patients with calcification had significantly higher serum parathormone and calcium 
      levels. In patients with calcification, high PTH levels correlated with an inferior 
      outcome of graft function at 1 year after transplantation (p<0.05). Therefore, 
      treatment of hyperparathyroidism should be considered earlier and more often in 
      these patients.

TI  - Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by-stander, 
      but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in 
      vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline 
      phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
      RESULTS: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants 
      were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline 
      phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with 
      older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher 
      serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone 
      levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but 
      the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate 
      time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of serum alkaline 
      phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone 
      metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase 
      was significantly associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 
      95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 
      1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in 
      hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. 
      Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis 
      patients.

AB  - Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and 
      augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an 
      unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the majority 
      of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data are 
      discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross sectional study 
      we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic 
      aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 
      61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans 
      were performed within a week of each other. There was no difference between races in 
      age, systolic blood pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent 
      history of hypertension (100% versus 89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia 
      (30% versus 66%; P<0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 
      pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% 
      versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 
      28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as 
      CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort 
      there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients 
      despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from 
      the general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer 
      vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and 
      others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise 
      the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in 
      patients of different races and with different risk profiles.

TI  - Radial artery sclerostin expression in chronic kidney disease stage 5 predialysis 
      patients: a cross-sectional observational study.
PG  - 1433-1437
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1604-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel 
      candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. The 
      aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression and 
      its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December 
      2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous 
      fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were collected 
      and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical 
      staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were 
      measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The prevalence of 
      positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries was 56.25%. Sclerostin 
      expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum sclerostin levels in 
      patients with positive sclerostin expression were much higher than in those with 
      negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including 
      potential confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, 
      serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline 
      phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      showed that only serum sclerostin levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin 
      expression (p = 0.025). The area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for 
      predicting positive vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity 
      and 85.7% specificity (p  = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin 
      expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Positive expression 
      of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was related to high serum sclerostin 
      levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local and systemic regulator involved in 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Aortic calcification and femoral bone density are independently associated with left 
      ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e39241
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039241 [doi]
LID - e39241
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in chronic 
      kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is 
      unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone 
      density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic 
      kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, 
      mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic 
      calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 
      48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 
      1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left 
      ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic 
      calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 
      vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 
      ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic 
      calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean 
      femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 
      0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic 
      calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% 
      of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral 
      Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with 
      increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that 
      underlies these relationships is warranted.

TI  - Insulin resistance and subclinical abnormalities of global and regional left 
      ventricular function in patients with aortic valve sclerosis.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/1475-2840-13-86 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance, as a key mediator of metabolic syndrome, is thought 
      to be associated with pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease and altered left 
      ventricular (LV) function and structure. However, in patients with aortic valve 
      sclerosis (AVS), the association between insulin resistance and subclinical 
      impairment of LV function is not fully elucidated. METHODS: We studied 57 patients 
      (mean age 70 ± 8 years, 22 women) with asymptomatic AVS but normal LV ejection 
      fraction in echocardiography. LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and strain 
      rate was analyzed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Patients 
      with uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and 
      concomitant coronary artery disease were excluded. They were divided into the 
      insulin-resistant group (AVS+IR; N = 28) and no insulin-resistant group (AVS-IR; 
      N = 29) according to the median value of homeostatic model assessment index. 
      Computed tomography scans were also performed to measure the aortic valve calcium 
      score and the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area. In addition, age- and sex- 
      adjusted 28 control subjects were recruited for the comparison. RESULTS: There were 
      no significant differences in LV ejection fraction or mass index among the groups. 
      The AVS+IR group had a higher aortic valve calcium score (median 94 versus 21, 
      P = 0.022) and a larger VAT area (113 ± 42 cm2 versus 77 ± 38 cm2, P = 0.001) than 
      the AVS-IR group. Notably, LV global longitudinal strain, strain rate (SR), and 
      early diastolic SR were significantly lower in the AVS+IR group than in the AVS-IR 
      group and in control subjects (strain: -16.2 ± 1.6% versus -17.2 ± 1.2% and 
      -18.9 ± 0.8%; SR: -1.18 ± 0.26 s(-1) versus -1.32 ± 0.21 s(-1) and -1.52 ± 0.08 
      s(-1); early diastolic SR: -1.09 ± 0.23 s(-1) versus -1.23 ± 0.18 s(-1) and 
      -1.35 ± 0.12 s(-1); P < 0.05 for all comparison), whereas circumferential function 
      were not significantly different. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed 
      insulin resistance as an independent determinant of LV longitudinal strain 
      (P = 0.017), SR (P = 0.047), and early diastolic SR (P = 0.049) regardless of LV 
      mass index or VAT area. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistance is a powerful independent 
      predictor of subclinical LV dysfunction regardless of concomitant visceral obesity 
      and LV hypertrophy. Thus, it may be a novel therapeutic target to prevent subsequent 
      heart failure in patients with AVS.

TI  - Ocular surface disorders and tear function changes in patients with chronic renal 
      failure.
PG  - 526-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ocular surface changes, mainly squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival 
      epithelium and corneoconjunctival calcification of unknown etiology, may develop in 
      patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. An association between 
      squamous metaplasia and corneoconjunctival calcification has been suggested. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between ocular surface 
      disorders and tear function changes in patients with chronic renal failure 
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 42 
      patients with chronic renal failure and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects 
      underwent full ophthalmologic examination, tear function tests (including Schirmer's 
      test, tear film break-up time [BUT] test and rose bengal staining) and impression 
      cytology to determine the degree of conjunctival squamous metaplasia. They also 
      responded to a questionnaire regarding subjective ocular complaints. 
      Corneoconjunctival calcification was graded on a scale of 0 to 5 according to the 
      system proposed by Porter and Crombie. Impression cytology samples were graded on 
      scale of 0 to 3 according to the Nelson classification. The relation between ocular 
      surface disorders and tear function changes was evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 42 
      patients, 12 (28%) had grade 0 calcification, 10 (24%) had grade 1, 14 (33%) had 
      grade 2, and 6 (14%) had grade 3 or higher. Four patients (10%) had grade 0 squamous 
      metaplasia, 22 (52%) had grade 1, 12 (28%) had grade 2, and 4 (10%) had grade 3. The 
      difference between the patient and control subjects in squamous metaplasia grades 
      and corneoconjunctival calcification grades was statistically significant (p < 0.001 
      and p = 0.022 respectively). Abnormal tear film BUT (p = 0.002) and abnormal rose 
      bengal staining (p = 0.023) were significantly more frequent in the patient group 
      than in the control group. The grade of conjunctival squamous metaplasia was 
      correlated with abnormal rose bengal staining (tau = 0.79, p < 0.001) and with the 
      existence of subjective ocular complaints (tau = 0.32, p = 0.026). There was no 
      correlation between corneoconjunctival calcification and tear function changes. 
      INTERPRETATION: Abnormal rose bengal staining and the presence of subjective ocular 
      complaints may be used as follow-up criteria for ocular surface disorders in 
      patients with chronic renal failure regularly undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in 
      maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed 
      the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray 
      examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of 
      biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth 
      factor-23 (FGF-23). RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients 
      with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited 
      lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely 
      associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular 
      calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of 
      AoAC. CONCLUSION: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was 
      dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of 
      circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 
      levels were independently associated with AoAC.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes mellitus, 
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy are the most 
      commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true 
      visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease 
      (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To 
      date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. 
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score 
      (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: 
      Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy 
      subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice 
      multidetector computed tomography scanner. RESULTS: There were no differences in 
      age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
      levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between 
      healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT 
      measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with 
      nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant 
      relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48). 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS 
      in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy 
      subjects.

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently 
      related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated 
      the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis 
      dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional 
      analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without 
      manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% 
      hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal 
      visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF 
      as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate 
      logistic regression. CAC (calcium score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those 
      presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male 
      gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference 
      (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 
      85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the 
      multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left 
      ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the 
      presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained 
      associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is 
      independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.

TI  - Calcification in arteriovenous fistula blood vessels may predict arteriovenous 
      fistula failure: a 5-year follow-up study.
PG  - 881-887
LID - 10.1007/s11255-017-1515-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for 
      hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains 
      unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the 
      light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification 
      process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the 
      calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity. METHODS: The 
      study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a 
      mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent 
      primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic 
      region was detected using X-ray examination. RESULTS: Calcification in AVF-blood 
      vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis 
      demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of 
      AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of 
      AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these 
      standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels 
      calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 
      (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Calcifications of 
      AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize 
      the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method 
      for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be 
      monitored more closely.

TI  - Influence of biochemical alterations on arterial stiffness in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - The incremental elastic modulus of the common carotid and radial arteries is 
      increased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), independently of blood 
      pressure, wall stress, and the presence of atherosclerotic alterations. Whether 
      biochemical factors may be involved in the arterial changes and related to renal 
      dysfunction remain largely ignored. To assess this question, we measured aortic 
      (carotid-femoral), upper-limb (carotid-radial), and lower-limb (femoral-tibial) 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 74 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis in comparison 
      with 57 control subjects similar in age, sex ratio, and mean blood pressure. We 
      evaluated arterial blood pressure by sphygmomanometry, aortic calcifications and 
      cardiac mass by echography, and routine biochemical parameters, total plasma 
      homocysteine, and plasma endothelin levels by standard techniques. In the population 
      of patients with ESRD, on the basis of multiple stepwise regression analysis, aortic 
      PWV was positively and independently correlated with systolic blood pressure 
      (P<.0001), age (P<.0001), prevalence of aortic calcification (P=.0004), and the 
      prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P=.0043). Upper-limb PWV was influenced exclusively 
      by mean blood pressure (P<.0001). Lower-limb PWV was positively and independently 
      correlated with plasma total homocysteine (P=.0004) and plasma endothelin (P=.0187) 
      only. At any vascular site, PWV was not independently correlated with tobacco 
      consumption; plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, or hemoglobin; 
      body mass index; or the presence of bilateral nephrectomy. Finally, plasma 
      homocysteine was independently correlated with cardiac mass (P=.0022). This study 
      provides evidence that in ESRD patients, the stiffness of the arterial wall and 
      cardiac mass are strongly influenced by biochemical factors related to the kidney 
      alterations and are independent of age and blood pressure level. Increased plasma 
      endothelin and homocysteine may be specifically involved in the vascular damage of 
      lower limbs.

TI  - Risk factors associated with coronary artery calcification should be examined before 
      kidney transplantation.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney 
      transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher incidence 
      of cardiovascular events compared with general population. Cardiovascular risk 
      factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of patients starting dialysis 
      or kidney transplantation already have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery 
      calcification is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions 
      and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 
      stable renal transplant recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk 
      factors associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and 
      quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients 
      and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were 
      significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients 
      without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular 
      calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than 
      those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 
      23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients 
      died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC 
      score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with 
      atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.

TI  - Sequence variation in vitamin K epoxide reductase gene is associated with survival 
      and progressive coronary calcification in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1591-6
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sequence variations in the gene(s) encoding vitamin K epoxide reductase 
      complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), the enzyme target of warfarin, have been associated with 
      increased cardiovascular disease in the general population. Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) is a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney 
      disease. We tested the hypothesis that the VKORC1 rs8050894 CC genotype would be 
      associated with mortality and progression of CAC ≤ 4 years. APPROACH AND RESULTS: 
      This study is an observational, prospective study of 167 individuals with stages 3 
      to 5 chronic kidney disease. Survival ≤ 4 years was assessed in all participants, 
      and CAC progression was measured in a subset of 86 patients. Participants with the 
      CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had higher baseline CAC scores (median score, 112 versus 
      299; P=0.036). Of those 86 patients who had a 4-year CAC score, those with the CG/GG 
      genotype had an increased risk of progressive CAC (adjusted for age, diabetes 
      mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension) compared with 
      those with the CC genotype. Four-year mortality risk was 4 times higher for 
      individuals with the CG/GG genotypes compared with individuals with the CC genotype 
      (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.5; P=0.02), adjusted for age, sex, 
      diabetes mellitus, estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline CAC, and 
      hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the CG/GG genotype of VKORC1 had a higher 
      risk of CAC progression and a poorer survival. These data provide new perspectives 
      on the potential extrahepatic role of VKORC1 in individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease.

TI  - Progressive vascular calcification over 2 years is associated with arterial 
      stiffening and increased mortality in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney 
      disease.
PG  - 1241-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an 
      important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, 
      cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular 
      calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 
      134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 
      chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial 
      femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave 
      velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at 
      baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. 
      Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients 
      with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The 
      hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who 
      were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive 
      calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta 
      blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated 
      with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 
      patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in 
      calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk 
      factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease 
      and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification 
      over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness 
      and mortality.

TI  - Metastatic calcification of the heart and lungs in end-stage renal disease: 
      detection and quantification by dual-energy digital chest radiography.
PG  - 881-7
AB  - Metastatic calcification of the lung and heart can cause severe cardiopulmonary 
      compromise and death. Although it is found in most end-stage renal disease patients 
      at autopsy, it is only rarely detected during life. Using a prototype dual-energy 
      digital chest radiographic unit, we measured calcium content (mg/cm2) over the lung 
      and heart in 32 hemodialysis patients. Pulmonary calcium content was significantly 
      greater in these patients than in sex-matched control subjects (men, 230 +/- 43 
      [mean +/- standard error] vs 166 +/- 7, p less than .05; women, 168 +/- 19 vs 110 
      +/- 7.5, p less than .001). Abnormal values were detected by dual-energy radiography 
      in 44% of patients (vs 9% of patients studied by conventional radiography). Cardiac 
      calcium content was also significantly greater in the hemodialysis patients than in 
      the control subjects (259 +/- 14 vs 184 +/- 8, p less than .05). Metastatic 
      calcification was significantly correlated with elevated phosphate and 
      calcium-phosphate product levels. Patients with significantly elevated pulmonary 
      calcium content had evidence of restrictive lung disease by functional testing. 
      There was an inverse correlation between elevated cardiac calcium content and 
      ejection fraction. We conclude that dual-energy digital radiography allows premortem 
      diagnosis of metastatic visceral calcification and is more sensitive than current 
      techniques.

TI  - Survival in Patients with Degenerative Mitral Stenosis: Results from a Large 
      Retrospective Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe mitral annular calcification causing degenerative mitral stenosis 
      (DMS) is increasingly encountered in patients undergoing mitral and aortic valve 
      interventions. However, its clinical profile and natural history and the factors 
      affecting survival remain poorly characterized. The goal of this study was to 
      characterize the factors affecting survival in patients with DMS. METHODS: An 
      institutional echocardiographic database was searched for patients with DMS, defined 
      as severe mitral annular calcification without commissural fusion and a mean 
      transmitral diastolic gradient of ≥2 mm Hg. This resulted in a cohort of 1,004 
      patients. Survival was analyzed as a function of clinical, pharmacologic, and 
      echocardiographic variables. RESULTS: The patient characteristics were as follows: 
      mean age, 73 ± 14 years; 73% women; coronary artery disease in 49%; and diabetes 
      mellitus in 50%. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 78% and 47%, respectively, 
      and were slightly worse with higher DMS grades (P = .02). Risk factors for higher 
      mortality included greater age (P < .0001), atrial fibrillation (P = .0009), renal 
      insufficiency (P = .004), mitral regurgitation (P < .0001), tricuspid regurgitation 
      (P < .0001), elevated right atrial pressure (P < .0001), concomitant aortic stenosis 
      (P = .02), and low serum albumin level (P < .0001). Adjusted for propensity scores, 
      use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (P = .02) or statins (P = .04) was 
      associated with better survival, and use of digoxin was associated with higher 
      mortality (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in patients with DMS is poor, being 
      worse in the aged and those with renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and other 
      concomitant valvular lesions. Renin-angiotensin system blockers and statins may 
      confer a survival benefit, and digoxin use may be associated with higher mortality 
      in these patients.

TI  - Impact of ENPP1 genotype on arterial calcification in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates 
      inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological 
      inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with 
      generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q 
      variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with 
      end-stage renal failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 79 patients with 
      end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the 
      ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype 
      (n=15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and 
      duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary 
      calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was 
      measured by pulse-wave analysis. RESULTS: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a 
      significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30; P=0.033), and also a 
      higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK 
      genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study 
      suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification 
      of patients with end-stage renal failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q 
      polymorphism have higher coronary calcification scores and increased aortic 
      stiffness, and may benefit from more intense treatment in order to prevent 
      progression of arterial calcification.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in CKD-5D  patients is tied to adverse cardiac 
      function  and increased mortality .
PG  - 291-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease on hemodialysis (CKD-5D) and is an important predictor of mortality. 
      However, cardiac functional links between CAC and mortality have not been well 
      established. This study tested the hypothesis that CAC increases mortality by 
      adversely affecting cardiac function. METHODS: Patients were recruited from 37 
      regional dialysis centers. 2-D and Doppler echocardiographic analyses were 
      performed, and CAC was measured using 64-slice computed tomography. Relationships 
      between CAC and echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) function were 
      analyzed. Survival was assessed with median follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: There 
      were 157 patients: 59% male, 46% Caucasian, 48% diabetic. Median age was 55 years, 
      and median duration of CKD-5D was 45 months. Agatston CAC scores 100 were found in 
      69% of patients, with 51% having a score  400. CAC was associated with measures of 
      LV systolic and diastolic function (global longitudinal strain (GLS; rho = 0.270, 
      p = 0.004)), peak LV systolic velocity (rho = -0.259, p = 0.004), and estimate of LV 
      filling pressure (E:E'; rho = 0.286, p = 0.001). Multivariate regression confirmed 
      these relationships after adjustment for age, gender, LV ejection fraction, and 
      coronary artery disease. Valvular calcification varied linearly with CAC (p < 0.05). 
      Both LV diastolic and systolic functional measures were significant predictors of 
      mortality, the strongest of which was LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings show a link between CAC, cardiac function, and mortality in CKD-5D. LV 
      diastolic function (E:E'), peak LV systolic velocity, and GLS are independent 
      predictors of mortality. Valvular calcification may be an important marker of CAC in 
      CKD-5D. These effects on cardiac function likely explain the high mortality with 
      CKD-5D and describe a potentially-valuable role for echocardiography in the routine 
      management of these patients. .

PG  - 458-67
LID - 10.3969/j.issn.1672-7347.2013.05.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), 
      tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the 
      atherosclerosis progress in the maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 19 patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and 11 healthy people as 
      control. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their age above or below 
      40 years old (11 and 8 in each, respectively), whereas the subjects in control group 
      were below 40 years old. All the clinical information of the research subjects was 
      collected: including age, gender, time of hemodialysis, blood pressure, blood urea 
      nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr). Immunohistochemistry and pathological 
      image analysis were used to investigate the pathological changes, calcification and 
      the expression of PAI-1, t-PA, and ET-1 on the blood vessel. RESULTS: Compared with 
      the age-matched healthy control group, there were higher blood vascular media 
      thickness, blood vascular media thickness/diagmeter ratio, blood vascular media 
      thickness area/vascular inter-wall area ratio (P<0.05) and more calcification 
      (P<0.05) in the the internal iliac artery in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. 
      All the results were similar when compared the above 40 years old group with the 
      below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. There were 
      positive correlation of blood vascular media thickness with age and blood pressure 
      (P<0.05). Expression of PAI-1, ET-1, t-PA on the internal iliac artery vessel was 
      elevated in the chronic renal failure MHD patients compared with the health control 
      (P<0.05). The level of PAI-1 or ET-1 was much higher in the above 40 years old group 
      than the below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas 
      there was no significant difference in the t-PA expression between the 2 groups 
      (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression with age and 
      blood pressure (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression 
      with blood vascular media thickness and calcification (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was 
      no correlation of hemodialysis time with blood vascular media thickness, 
      calcification, PAI-1, t-PA, or ET-1 expressions. CONCLUSION: MHD patients accompany 
      with atherosclerosis which is severer in the patients above 40 years old than the 
      patients below 40 years old. The higher of the blood pressure, the severer of the 
      atherosclerosis. Abnormal expression of PAI-1 plays an important role in the 
      progress of the atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas 
      t-PA has no function in this process. The level of PAI-1 and ET-1 would be helpful 
      to evaluating the degree of atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD 
      patients. Hemodialysis time may not be a potential accelerator for atherosclerosis 
      progression.

TI  - Detection of coronary and peripheral artery calcification in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 3208-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent of 
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished to 
      determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would assist in 
      identifying patients positive for CAC. METHODS: CAC was detected by multi-slice 
      computed tomography and PAC was detected by plain foot radiography. Study population 
      was 112 patients, 54 with diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart 
      disease. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5% with and without diabetes, 
      respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more vessels 
      affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same risk for CAC. 
      In patients with diabetes, age was the unique explanatory variable for detecting the 
      presence of CAC, while age and smoking history predicted severity. In patients 
      without diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the presence of CAC, while parathyroid 
      hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC was 63 and 12% in subjects with and 
      without diabetes. PAC detected by foot radiography was not an adequate 
      alternative-screening marker for identifying patients with CAC. CONCLUSIONS: CAC is 
      common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in men and women with diabetes.

AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called 
      novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery 
      calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to 
      identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by 
      MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, 
      presence of ≥100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate, geriatric 
      nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3, cinacalcet, phosphate 
      binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation parameters including creatinine, 
      albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 MHD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcifications were observed in 192 patients (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS 
      showed direct associations with age (p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and 
      presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), and an inverse association only with 
      active vitamin D3 administration (p < 0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active 
      vitamin D3 showed significantly lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 ± 1635.0 
      vs. 2475.6 ± 2646.6 H, p < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and 
      diabetes mellitus are risk factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is 
      protective factor for coronary artery calcification in MHD patients.

TI  - Cardiac calcification in adult hemodialysis patients. A link between end-stage renal 
      disease and cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 695-701
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of 
      calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves in 
      adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. 
      BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic heart 
      disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience accelerated 
      vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of mineral metabolism. 
      Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. 
      Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as measured by electron-beam 
      tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population. METHODS: We 
      conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis patients who 
      received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. We 
      compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular 
      disease and determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular 
      calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional odds logistic 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 
      (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of 
      obstructive coronary artery disease in the general population. The CA calcium scores 
      were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and 
      angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the 
      prevalence of claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of 
      coronary calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, 
      diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and 
      phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density 
      lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not 
      significantly related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage was 
      significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly associated with 
      ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral 
      metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification risk.

      and/or coronary artery disease.
PG  - 880-90
AB  - Little is known about the association between plasma levels of pigment 
      epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). This study evaluated 289 consecutive patients with chest pain 
      or at least one coronary risk factor who underwent coronary angiography using 
      multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT). Presence of CAD and CKD, CAD severity 
      (i.e. number of significantly stenosed coronary vessels, described as vessel disease 
      [VD]), coronary calcification scores, visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area 
      on MDCT, and metabolic biomarkers were recorded. PEDF levels correlated 
      significantly with sex, VFA, CKD presence/hyperuricaemia and high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PEDF levels were closely associated with CKD and 
      were significantly higher in CKD patients than in non-CKD patients, regardless of 
      the presence of CAD. CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD had higher plasma PEDF 
      levels than non-CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD. It is concluded that PEDF may 
      be associated with CKD regardless of the presence of CAD.

TI  - Is coronary artery calcification associated with vertebral bone density in 
      nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients?
PG  - 1456-62
LID - 10.2215/CJN.10061110 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low bone mineral density and coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are highly prevalent among chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients, and both conditions are strongly associated with higher mortality. The 
      study presented here aimed to investigate whether reduced vertebral bone density 
      (VBD) was associated with the presence of CAC in the earlier stages of CKD. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Seventy-two nondialyzed CKD patients (age 52 
      ± 11.7 years, 70% male, 42% diabetics, creatinine clearance 40.4 ± 18.2 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2)) were studied. VBD and CAC were quantified by computed tomography. 
      RESULTS: CAC > 10 Agatston units (AU) was observed in 50% of the patients (median 
      120 AU [interquartile range 32 to 584 AU]), and a calcification score ≥ 400 AU was 
      found in 19% (736 [527 to 1012] AU). VBD (190 ± 52 Hounsfield units) correlated 
      inversely with age (r = -0.41, P < 0.001) and calcium score (r = -0.31, P = 0.01), 
      and no correlation was found with gender, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, lipid 
      profile, mineral parameters, body mass index, and diabetes. Patients in the lowest 
      tertile of VBD had expressively increased calcium score in comparison to the middle 
      and highest tertile groups. In the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting 
      for confounding variables, low VBD was independently associated with the presence of 
      CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Low VBD was associated with CAC in nondialyzed CKD patients. The 
      authors suggest that low VBD might constitute another nontraditional risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease in CKD.

TI  - Cross-sectional association of kidney function with valvular and annular 
      calcification: the Framingham heart study.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - Valvular calcification is common in the setting of end-stage kidney disease and is 
      associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease events. It is unknown 
      whether the prevalence of valvular calcification is increased in milder kidney 
      disease after accounting for cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who attended 
      the sixth examination of the Framingham Offspring Study (1995 to 1998) were 
      eligible. Kidney function was estimated by GFR using the simplified Modification of 
      Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Mitral annular calcification (MAC), aortic 
      sclerosis, and aortic annular calcification were assessed by two-dimensional 
      echocardiography. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of valvular 
      calcification among participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD; GFR < 60 ml/min 
      per 1.73 m(2)). A total of 3047 participants (52% women; mean age 59 +/- 10 yr) were 
      available for analysis. CKD was present in 8.6% (n = 262) of the sample. Among 
      participants with valve/annular calcification (n = 284; 9.3%), 20% had CKD, compared 
      with 7% in patients without valvular calcification. After adjustment for age, 
      gender, systolic and diastolic BP, hypertension treatment, total/HDL cholesterol, 
      body mass index, diabetes, smoking status, and cardiovascular disease, participants 
      with CKD had a 60% increased odds of MAC (odds ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 
      1.03 to 2.5). There was no significant association between CKD and either aortic 
      sclerosis or aortic annular calcification (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.1, respectively). 
      After age and gender adjustment, the combination of both CKD and MAC was associated 
      with a three-fold increased risk for death compared with those with neither 
      condition (P = 0.0004). In the community, CKD is associated with presence of MAC 
      before the onset of ESRD. Further research is warranted to understand whether 
      traditional and novel vascular risk factor burden, as well as metabolic derangements 
      found in early kidney disease, can account for the CKD-MAC association.

TI  - Increased incidence of benign breast disease in female renal transplant patients 
      receiving cyclosporin.
PG  - 222-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unlike other cancers, breast cancer does not occur at increased 
      frequency in renal transplant patients but fibroadenomata may be more common as a 
      result of exposure to cyclosporin. In order to determine the incidence of benign 
      breast disease in renal transplant patients at Monash Medical Centre, current female 
      patients were studied. METHODS: The study was divided into two parts: (i) a 
      retrospective review of those who presented with clinically detectable breast lumps; 
      and (ii) mammographic screening of current female transplant patients who had been 
      transplanted for more than 1 year. RESULTS: In the retrospective study there were 11 
      patients with 16 breast lumps among a total of 85 patients. All were confirmed by 
      biopsy. The mean age at diagnosis of breast lumps was 41.5 years (range 25-70 
      years). The mean time to presentation was 3.5 years after transplantation. Nine out 
      of 11 patients had benign breast disease including fibroadenoma (six patients), 
      fibrocystic disease (two patients) and intraductal papillomatosis (one patient). Two 
      patients had breast cancer. Five of the patients with fibroadenoma had multiple 
      lumps and a recurrent course. All patients with fibroadenomata had received 
      cyclosporin. In the second part, 54 patients were further screened. The mean 
      duration of transplantation was 6.4 years (range 1.25-18.5 years). Eighty-seven per 
      cent of the patients had received cyclosporin, and 80% had a negative (normal) 
      study. Seven of 54 had abnormalities including cysts and calcification, of whom two 
      patients had fibroadenomata. Four patients had 'dense mammograms', all of whom 
      received cyclosporin as a part of their immunosuppression. No breast cancer was 
      detected during the study. CONCLUSION: The incidence of benign breast disease in the 
      female transplant patients studied was far greater then the general population. The 
      increase in fibroadenomata, in particular, may relate to the use of cyclosporin.

TI  - A low fractional excretion of Phosphate/Fgf23 ratio is associated with severe 
      abdominal Aortic calcification in stage 3 and 4 kidney disease patients.
PG  - 221
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution 
      to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4. 
      METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were 
      studied in 178 patients. RESULTS: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated 
      positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and 
      also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). 
      Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with 
      reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients 
      with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in 
      patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic 
      response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis 
      confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with 
      AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the 
      chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI 
      remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly 
      increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 
      associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.

TI  - Cardiac calcifications: Fetuin-A and other risk factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - Cardiac calcifications are a frequent finding in hemodialysis for chronic renal 
      failure. Several factors may play a role in the intimal and medial calcification of 
      coronary arteries such as age and some known atherogenetic factors. In addition, 
      Fetuin-A has been proposed as a protective agent through solubilization of calcium 
      phosphate salt. Fetuin-A is also a marker of inflammatory-nutritional state, and its 
      changes could be an expression of this condition. The aim of this cross-sectional 
      study is to evaluate the relative importance of risk factors of calcifications with 
      special regard to Fetuin-A. The study was conducted with 132 hemodialysis patients. 
      They were subjected to multislice computed tomography for evaluation of calcium 
      deposits in the heart. In addition, the patients were sampled for evaluation of 
      calcium-phosphate parameters, lipid profile, nutritional and inflammatory markers, 
      and also Fetuin-A. There was a wide variability of the extent of calcium deposits 
      expressed as Agatston score, with only 9.3% of patients without calcifications. Age, 
      hemodialysis age, sex, calcium-phosphate parameters, and lipid profile were 
      important risk factors, together with nutritional and inflammatory status of the 
      patients. An inverse correlation between coronary calcium score and Fetuin-A emerged 
      from a multiple regression analysis. However, there was no significant difference in 
      serum Fetuin-A among different grades of calcium score. By dividing the patients in 
      tertiles of serum Fetuin-A, an association between low levels of Fetuin-A and high 
      calcification score was found. Fetuin-A as dependent variable was strictly linked to 
      prealbumin serum levels. In addition, there was a clear link between cardiac 
      calcification scores and inflammatory-nutritional markers. Serum calcium and 
      treatment with calcitriol emerged as predictive variables of coronary score.Fetuin-A 
      could be involved in the process of calcification both in the case of markedly low 
      serum levels, due to decreased prevention of calcium phosphate precipitation, and 
      also as a marker of inflammation, a well-known risk factor of atherogenesis. 
      Treatment with intravenous calcitriol could marginally enhance cardiac 
      calcifications, probably through its hypercalcemic effect.

TI  - Does hemodiafiltration reduce vascular stiffness measured by aortic pulse wave 
      velocity compared with high-flux hemodialysis?
PG  - 391-5
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12119 [doi]
AB  - Hemodialfiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce the frequency of intradialytic 
      hypotension compared with hemodialysis (HD). We wished to determine whether HDF 
      resulted in improvement of arterial stiffness compared with HD. We reviewed 
      peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements in a cross-sectional 
      analysis of stable HDF and HD outpatients. One hundred forty-one HDF patients were 
      matched to 148 HD patients in terms of age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, peripheral 
      blood pressure, and body mass. Pulse wave velocity was not different between the HD 
      and HDF cohorts (median 9.1 [8.0-10.7] m/s vs. 9.7 [8.5-11.6] m/s). Similarly, there 
      were no differences in central aortic pressure (149.2 ± 30.9 mmHg vs. 151.9 ± 35.2 
      mmHg), or aortic (39 [25.1-51.2]% vs. 38.6 [25.8-51.4]%) and brachial (3.8 [-24.3 to 
      26.9]% vs. 3 [-22.4 to 27.1]%) augmentation indices, respectively. Pulse wave 
      velocity did not differ between adult patients treated by HD and HDF, and similarly, 
      there were no differences in central aortic pressure, aortic or brachial 
      augmentation indices, and cardiac diastolic perfusion. Our study suggests that HDF 
      does not appear to offer any benefit over HD in terms of vascular stiffness.

LID - e0171873
AB  - Hemodialysis (HD) patients face increased fracture risk, which is further associated 
      with elevated risk of hospitalization and mortality. High-resolution peripheral 
      computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has advanced our understanding of bone disease in 
      chronic kidney disease by characterizing distinct changes in both the cortical and 
      trabecular compartments. Increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) has been shown to be 
      associated with fracture in patients with osteopenia or in postmenopausal diabetic 
      women. We tested whether the degree of Ct.Po identifies hemodialysis patients with 
      prevalent fragility fractures in comparison to bone mineral density (BMD) assessed 
      by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a 
      cross-sectional study in 76 prevalent hemodialysis patients. Markers of mineral 
      metabolism, coronary calcification score, DXA-, and HR-pQCT-data were analyzed, and 
      Ct.Po determined at radius and tibia. Ct.Po was significantly higher in patients 
      with fracture but association was lost after adjusting for age and gender (tibia p = 
      0.228, radius p = 0.5). Instead, femoral (F) BMD neck area (p = 0.03), F T-score 
      neck area (p = 0.03), radius (R) BMD (p = 0.03), R T-score (p = 0.03), and cortical 
      HR-pQCT indices such as cortical area (Ct.Ar) (tibia: p = 0.01; radius: p = 0.02) 
      and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (tibia: p = 0.03; radius: p = 0.02) correctly 
      classified patients with fragility fractures. Area under receiver operating 
      characteristic curves (AUC) for Ct.Po (tibia AUC: 0.711; p = 0.01; radius AUC: 
      0.666; p = 0.04), Ct.Ar (tibia AUC: 0.832; p<0.001; radius AUC: 0.796; p<0.001), and 
      F neck BMD (AUC: 0.758; p = 0.002) did not differ significantly among each other. In 
      conclusion, measuring Ct.Po is not superior to BMD determined by DXA for 
      identification of HD patients with fragility fracture.

TI  - Vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 4183-6
AB  - The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include 
      duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, 
      hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was 
      performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis 
      population. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent 
      plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or 
      negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 
      calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid 
      hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients 
      (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for 
      duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = 
      .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or 
      iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not 
      different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to 
      NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = 
      .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, 
      P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the 
      duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular 
      calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other 
      factors in patients with longer dialysis.

TI  - Lower Serum Irisin Levels Are Associated with Increased Vascular Calcification in 
      Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 287-295
LID - 10.1159/000487689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular 
      transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is prevalent 
      and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex and unclear. 
      We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play roles in vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate serum irisin 
      levels and establish their relation to vascular calcification and other parameters 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 150 patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in 
      this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA. 
      Vascular calcification was evaluated by abdominal aortic calcification scores. 
      RESULTS: Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis 
      patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0) vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, 
      P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively correlated with the parathyroid hormone 
      level (P=0.01). The HD patients with vascular calcification showed significantly 
      lower serum irisin concentrations [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, 
      P<0.01]. Compared with the group without vascular calcification multivariate 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were 
      significant independent determinant factors for vascular calcification in HD 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Our results are the first to provide a clinical evidence of 
      the association between serum irisin and vascular calcification in HD patients. 
      Lower irisin levels, long-term hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk 
      factors in HD patients.

AB  - Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased mortality in 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), but the pathogenesis of this condition 
      is not well understood. We evaluated the relationship of CAC score (CACs) and 
      variability in serum phosphorus in MHD patients. Seventy-seven adults on MHD at 
      Huashan Hospital (Shanghai) were enrolled in July, 2010. CAC of all the patients 
      were measured by computed tomography and CACs was calculated by the Agatston method 
      at the entry of enrollment. Patients were divided into three categories according to 
      their CACs (0∼10, 11∼400, and >400). Blood chemistry was recorded every 3 months 
      from January 2008 to July 2010. Phosphorus variation was defined by the standard 
      deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation (CV) and it was calculated from the past 
      records. The ordinal multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze 
      the predictors of CAC. The mean patient age (± SD) was 61.7 years (±11.3) and 51% of 
      patients were men. The mean CACs was 609.6 (±1062.9), the median CACs was 168.5, and 
      78% of patients had CACs more than 0. Multivariate analysis indicated that female 
      gender (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07-0.55), age (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.32-4.04), serum 
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.31-3.85), SD-phosphorus 
      calculated from the most recent 6 measurements (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.23-3.63), and 
      CV-phosphorus calculated from the most recent 6 measurements (OR = 1.90, 95% 
      CI = 1.16-3.11) were significantly and independently associated with CACs. These 
      associations persisted for phosphorus variation calculated from past 7, 8, 9, 10, 
      and 11 follow-up values. Variability of serum phosphorus may contribute 
      significantly to CAC and keeping serum phosphorus stable may decrease coronary 
      calcification and associated morbidity and mortality in MHD patients.

TI  - Evaluation of aortic arch calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) is related to 
      cardiovascular (CV) disease. Vascular calcifications are common findings in dialysis 
      patients; therefore, we carried out a retrospective study evaluating which risk 
      factors are associated to AAC in stable hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 
      Standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs, performed the day after the midweek 
      HD session in 132 patients (mean age 65 +/- 12 yrs) who had been on renal 
      replacement therapy (RRT) for 33 months (range 1-471), were analyzed. Cardiothoracic 
      ratio (CTR) was also calculated. RESULTS: AAC was detected in 51% of patients. They 
      were older (68 +/- 8 vs. 62 +/- 14 yrs; p = 0.003), were on RRT for longer (51 
      (range 2-471) vs. 22 (range 1-195) months; p = 0.0001), had greater CTR (54 (32-71) 
      vs. 50% (40-65); p = 0.034) and higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease 
      (PVD) (40 vs. 17%; p = 0.049), whilst body weight was lower (62 +/- 14 vs. 68 +/- 14 
      kg; p = 0.04) than those without AAC. On the contrary, sex, diabetes frequency, 
      smoking habit, history of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia, cerebrovascular and 
      ischemic heart disease (IHD), blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive therapy, 
      lipids, albumin, degree of anemia, calcium, phosphate and their product were no 
      different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds 
      ratio (OR) 1.069 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.11; p = 0.003), length of 
      time on RRT (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.0002), calcium-phosphate product (OR 
      1.03 95% CI 1.007-1.07; p = 0.016), systolic BP (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.005-1.06; p = 
      0.02) and PVD (OR 3.08 95% CI 1.17-8.06; p = 0.02) were independently associated to 
      AAC. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AAC is related to atherosclerosis and to renal 
      failure-related CV risk factors. A careful evaluation of a frequently performed 
      investigation is useful in CV disease risk stratification in HD patients.

AB  - To analyze predictive factors for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) 
      mortality, nonfatal CV events (CVE) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and 
      to compare the effects of standard hemodialysis (HD) and online hemodiafiltration 
      (HDF) on these factors and outcomes. A total of 333 MHD patients were prospectively 
      followed up for 50 ± 15 months and all-cause death, CV death and CVE were 
      registered. At the baseline, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the whole 
      population were recorded. Then, patients were stratified into two groups according 
      to the dialysis modalities, HD (n = 268) and HDF (n = 65). At the end of 6th month, 
      clinical and laboratory data were recorded again. The predictive factors at baseline 
      for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE were analyzed by Cox regression. The 
      effects of HD and HDF on these factors at the 6th month and long-term outcomes were 
      compared by t-test and Kaplan-Meier method, respectively. Age, gender, left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI), aortic arch calcification score (AoACS), hemoglobin 
      (Hb) <10 g/dL, and ferritin >500 ng/mL maintained independent associations with 
      all-cause mortality. C-reactive protein (CRP), LVMI, AoACS, and Hb <10 g/dL were 
      associated with CV mortality. Prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), AoACS and LVMI 
      were independent predictors of nonfatal CVE. Higher body mass index (BMI), body 
      weight, total serum cholesterol, Hb concentration, and lower CRP level, LVMI, and 
      AoACS were found in patients on HDF at the end of the 6th month. Improved outcomes 
      with longer survival time for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE were found 
      in HDF group. Age, gender, LVMI, AoACS, Hb, and ferritin were predictors of 
      all-cause mortality in MHD patients. CRP, LVMI, AoACS, and Hb were associated with 
      CV mortality. Prior CVD, AoACS, and LVMI were independent predictors of nonfatal 
      CVE. HDF could improve BMI, body weight, total serum cholesterol, Hb, CRP, LVMI, 
      AoACS, and long-term outcomes, including all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcifications and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 733-8
AB  - Cardiac valve calcification (VC) is a common finding in end-stage renal disease 
      patients. It was shown recently that VC is an independent predictor for all-cause 
      and cardiovascular mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients. In hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients, VC was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but after 
      adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors and complications, as well as left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI), it lost significance. The aim of the study was to 
      assess the relationship between VC and left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis 
      patients. Echocardiographic examination with mitral and aortic valves assessment and 
      LVMI calculation was performed in 65 HD patients ages 49+/-12, with duration of HD 
      therapy 38+/-32 months. VC were found in 32 of 65 patients (49%)-Group VC(+), mitral 
      valve calcifications (MVC) in 10, aortic valve calcifications (AVC) in 9, and both 
      valves calcifications (MVC+AVC) in 13 patients. Patients with VC were older, on HD 
      therapy were longer, had higher systolic and pulse pressure, and had higher LVMI. 
      Patients with both VCs had the highest LVMI. No significant differences were found 
      with respect to Ca, P, PTH, and mean Ca x P product, but the incidence of Ca x P 
      product above 4.43 mmol2/L2 was higher in VC(+) compared with those without VCs. VC 
      coexists with left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly when both valves are 
      calcified. Even short-lasting incidents of increased Ca x P product may lead to 
      cardiac VC.

TI  - FGF-23 levels are associated with vascular calcification, but not with 
      atherosclerosis, in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with 
      mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim 
      of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma 
      FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional 
      study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent 
      coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized 
      tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution color Doppler 
      ultrasonography. RESULTS: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs 
      was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 
      400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, 
      and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level 
      was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 
      0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence 
      of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal 
      regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs 
      together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model 
      r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in 
      patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the 
      prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with 
      carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.

LID - 10.1159/000334597 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis 
      patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT 
      interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to 
      elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval 
      duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We performed a 
      single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. 
      Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. 
      Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays. RESULTS: In the final 
      analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT 
      interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an 
      independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of 
      aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular 
      history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged 
      QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is 
      associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

TI  - High Serum Sclerostin Levels Are Associated with a Better Outcome in Haemodialysis 
      Patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1159/000443845 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis. 
      Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification 
      (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin 
      levels are high. AIM: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, 
      bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum 
      sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and 
      survival rate. RESULTS: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin 
      level of 1.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum 
      sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were 
      significantly older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male 
      gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 
      ± 9 vs. 20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed 
      lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD 
      scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate 
      compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% 
      CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher 
      BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate.

TI  - Peripheral vascular calcification in long-haemodialysis patients: associated factors 
      and survival consequences.
PG  - 948-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with 
      numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension 
      and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD 
      patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of 
      sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and 
      effects on the 1-year survival rate. METHODS: We studied HD patients from one centre 
      using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and 
      extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to 
      their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological 
      data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, 
      beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year 
      survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the 
      centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects 
      were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 
      months (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l 
      dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients 
      were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were 
      classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, 
      more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 
      'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and 
      low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and 
      FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a 
      score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to 
      patients with a 0 score. CONCLUSION: A plain radiological score showed the high 
      prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis 
      strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic 
      factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure 
      and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association 
      with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The 
      harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and 
      optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD 
      patients.

TI  - Relationship of estimated GFR and coronary artery calcification in the CRIC (Chronic 
      Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study.
PG  - 519-26

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased 
      mortality risk in the general population. Although individuals with chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) are at markedly increased mortality risk, the incidence, prevalence, 
      and prognosis of CAC in CKD are not well understood. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 1,908 participants who 
      underwent coronary calcium scanning as part of the multiethnic CRIC (Chronic Renal 
      Insufficiency Cohort) Study. PREDICTOR: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      computed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, 
      stratified by race, sex, and diabetic status. eGFR was treated as a continuous and a 
      categorical variable compared with the reference value of >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). 
      MEASUREMENTS: CAC detected using computed tomography (CT) using either an Imatron 
      C-300 electron beam computed tomography (CT) scanner or multidetector CT scanner. 
      CAC was computed using Agatston score as a categorical variable. Analyses were 
      performed using ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: We found a strong and graded 
      relationship between lower eGFR and increasing CAC. In unadjusted models, ORs 
      increased from 1.68 (95% CI, 1.23-2.31) for eGFR of 50-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 2.82 
      (95% CI, 2.06-3.85) for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable adjustment only 
      partially attenuated the results (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.20) for eGFR <30 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2). LIMITATIONS: Use of eGFR rather than measured GFR. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      showed a graded relationship between severity of CKD and CAC independent of 
      traditional risk factors. These findings support recent guidelines that state that 
      if vascular calcification is present, it should be considered as a complementary 
      component to be included in the decision making required for individualizing CKD 
      treatment.

TI  - The Association of Coronary Artery Calcium With Noncardiovascular Disease: The 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 568-576
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2015.09.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine if coronary artery calcium (CAC) is 
      associated with incident noncardiovascular disease. BACKGROUND: CAC is considered a 
      measure of vascular aging, associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and 
      all-cause mortality. The relationship with noncardiovascular disease is not well 
      defined. METHODS: A total of 6,814 participants from 6 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis) field centers were followed for a median of 10.2 years. Modified 
      Cox proportional hazards ratios accounting for the competing risk of fatal coronary 
      heart disease were calculated for new diagnoses of cancer, pneumonia, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), deep vein 
      thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, hip fracture, and dementia. Analyses were adjusted 
      for age; sex; race; socioeconomic status; health insurance status; body mass index; 
      physical activity; diet; tobacco use; number of medications used; systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure; total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; 
      antihypertensive, aspirin, and cholesterol medication; and diabetes. The outcome was 
      first incident noncardiovascular disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with those 
      with CAC = 0, those with CAC >400 had an increased hazard of cancer (hazard ratio 
      [HR]: 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18 to 1.99), CKD (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.21 
      to 2.39), pneumonia (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.82), COPD (HR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.60 
      to 4.57), and hip fracture (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 1.47 to 12.50). CAC >400 was not 
      associated with dementia or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. Those with 
      CAC = 0 had decreased risk of cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.92), CKD (HR: 
      0.77; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.98), COPD (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.91), and hip fracture 
      (HR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.70) compared to those with CAC >0. CAC = 0 was 
      not associated with less pneumonia, dementia, or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary 
      embolism. The results were attenuated, but remained significant, after removing 
      participants developing interim nonfatal coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Participants with elevated CAC were at increased risk of cancer, CKD, COPD, and hip 
      fractures. Those with CAC = 0 are less likely to develop common age-related comorbid 
      conditions, and represent a unique population of "healthy agers."

TI  - Evolution of coronary artery calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      Stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 2582-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq751 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to report the evolution of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 comparing 
      those with and without diabetes. We previously reported prevalence in the same 
      population. METHODS: CAC was measured using multi-slice computer tomography. We 
      prospectively followed up 103 patients for 2 years, 49 with diabetes and 54 without 
      diabetes. Demographic, routine biochemistry, calcification inhibitors and bone 
      mineral density data were collected and analysed. Evolution of CAC was defined as 
      those with a difference of ≥ 2.5 U between baseline and final square root CAC 
      scores. RESULTS: There were more progressors in the group with diabetes, 24 compared 
      to 12 in the group without diabetes (P= 0.004). When diabetes was present, CAC 
      progressed equally in men and women. Risk factors for evolution of CAC included age, 
      baseline CAC score and serum phosphate levels. Baseline CAC score, phosphate and 
      body mass index were independent predictors for the increase of CAC score during the 
      study period. Severity of CAC was greater in the diabetes group (median CAC score at 
      baseline in the group with diabetes 154 increased to 258 2 years later, P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evolution of CAC is greater in older patients and those with diabetes, 
      where the gender advantage of being female is lost. Serum phosphate level, despite 
      being within the normal range and virtually no use of phosphate binders, was also a 
      risk factor. Further studies are required to determine the levels of serum phosphate 
      required to minimize cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation and low vitamin D levels are associated with severe vascular 
      calcifications in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 419-426

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major complications 
      of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, which should be 
      prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased risk of VCs and 
      fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and 
      without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the 
      associated risk factors. METHODS: A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were 
      recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney 
      disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected. 
      Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of 
      fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by ≥20 %. In the same radiograph, the 
      length of aortic calcification was also measured. Logistic regression models were 
      applied for evaluating the independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral 
      fractures. RESULTS: In our population VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs 
      (>10 cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 %) than in patients without 
      (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis 
      showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI 2.30-12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 
      2.05, 95 % CI 1.10-3.83) were independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % 
      CI 1.01-1.07) and male gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07-2.90) predicted vertebral 
      fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe 
      VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated 
      with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and 
      associated with older age and male gender.

TI  - Adiponectin is associated with early diabetic kidney disease in adults with type 1 
      diabetes: A Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations between elevated adiponectin and end-stage renal disease 
      are well recognized and thought to be at least partially explained by reduced renal 
      clearance. Conversely, the relationship between adiponectin and early diabetic 
      kidney disease (DKD) with preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR), including 
      rapid GFR decline and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. We 
      hypothesized that elevated adiponectin would be associated with early DKD in adults 
      with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Adults with type 1 diabetes (n=646 at baseline, n=525 
      at 6years) had adiponectin and renal function by estimated GFR (eGFR) by CKD-EPI 
      creatinine and albumin-excretion rate (AER) evaluated at baseline and 6years. Linear 
      and logistic models evaluated the associations of baseline adiponectin with AER, 
      macroalbuminuria (AER ≥200μg/min), eGFR, CKD (<60mL/min/1.73m(2)) and rapid GFR 
      decline (>3mL/min/1.73m(2)/year). Models adjusted for age, sex, duration, HbA1c, 
      SBP, LDL-C and current smoking. RESULTS: Compared to non-diabetics, adults with type 
      1 diabetes had significantly higher adiponectin, and the difference remained 
      significant after adjusting for AER and/or eGFR (p<0.0001). Adiponectin at baseline 
      was positively associated with rapid GFR decline (OR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.53), 
      incident CKD (OR: 1.75, 1.14-2.70), and persistent macroalbuminuria and CKD (OR: 
      1.61, 1.10-2.36) over 6years in adjusted models. The associations also remained 
      significant after further adjustments for CRP, estimated insulin sensitivity and 
      ACEi/ARB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 1 diabetes have higher adiponectin 
      than their non-diabetic peers, and elevated adiponectin at baseline is independently 
      associated with greater odds of developing early DKD over 6years.

TI  - The impact of antihypertensive drug therapy on endotoxemia in elderly patients with 
      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2389-94
LID - 10.2215/CJN.11211210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endotoxin (ET) is recognized to cause adverse effects on 
      cardiovascular (CV) structure. Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET is 
      described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people 
      and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore studied ET 
      after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of optimized 
      antihypertensive therapy (AHT). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We 
      recruited 40 hypertensive nondiabetic patients (≥70 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 
      and hypertensive non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was performed after complete 
      AHT washout and repeated after AHT reintroduction to target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by applanation tonometry, central 
      hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave analysis, vascular calcification (VC) 
      by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay. RESULTS: 
      Mean age was 76 ± 5 years, estimated GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 ± 14 ml/min per 
      1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was 128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 ± 0.011 EU/ml and 
      was independent of renal function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial stiffness, and 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased with AHT (to 0.020 ± 
      0.028 EU/ml; P < 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = -0.38; P = 0.02), arterial 
      wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 0.01), and degree of tonic 
      vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = -0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC, PWV, 
      gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly 
      patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. Improvement of their CV status 
      with optimized AHT is associated with a significant reduction in endotoxemia. 
      Further investigation of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking CV 
      disease and CKD with this previously unappreciated effect of AHT appears warranted.

TI  - Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with changes in bone mineral markers 
      in advanced CKD.
PG  - 281

LID - 281
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are 
      limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, 
      including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast 
      growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl). METHODS: In this prospective, 
      single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 
      and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at 
      baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated 
      using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline. RESULTS: Forty patients with CKD [mean 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m(2)] and 42 
      controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m(2)) completed follow-up. There were no 
      differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant 
      increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was 
      observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid 
      hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects 
      had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic 
      PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, 
      aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) 
      in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic 
      elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, 
      abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness and 
      serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, 
      increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant 
      association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. 
      Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the 
      temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and 
      vascular disease.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast 
      activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent data indicate 
      that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular calcification. OBJECTIVE: The 
      present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with 
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet 
      receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was 
      assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to 
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin 
      levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify 
      determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. 
      Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) 
      (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of 
      AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin 
      levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher 
      body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower 
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In 
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history 
      (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent 
      determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that 
      patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in 
      multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and 
      experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin 
      protects against progression of vascular calcification.

TI  - Rapid GFR decline is associated with renal hyperfiltration and impaired GFR in 
      adults with Type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 1706-11
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfv121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline (>3 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) is 
      an increasingly recognized high-risk diabetic nephropathy (DN) phenotype in Type 1 
      diabetes. Rapid GFR decline is a recognized predictor of impaired GFR (<60 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2)). However, the association between rapid GFR decline and renal 
      hyperfiltration is not well described in Type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that renal 
      hyperfiltration (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) 
      would predict rapid GFR decline over 6 years and that rapid GFR decline would 
      predict impaired GFR at 6 years in adults with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: GFR was 
      calculated by chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) creatinine in 646 adults 
      with Type 1 diabetes in the coronary artery calcification in Type 1 diabetes study. 
      Logistic multivariable models were employed to investigate the relationships between 
      renal hyperfiltration and rapid GFR decline, and rapid GFR decline and incident 
      impaired GFR over 6 years. RESULTS: Renal hyperfiltration predicted greater odds of 
      rapid GFR decline over 6 years [odds ratio (OR): 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      3.03-8.25, P < 0.0001] adjusting for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure 
      (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), sex, duration, log of 
      albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, rapid GFR 
      decline predicted greater odds of incident impaired eGFR (OR: 15.99, 95% CI 
      2.34-114.37, P = 0.006) in a similarly adjusted model. Sensitivity analyses with GFR 
      calculated by CKD-EPI combined creatinine and cystatin C, and renal hyperfiltration 
      defined as ≥135 mL/min/1.73 m(2) yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In adults 
      with Type 1 diabetes, rapid GFR decline over 6 years was associated with baseline 
      renal hyperfiltration and incident GFR impairment. These observations may suggest an 
      intermediate and predictive role of rapid GFR decline in the progression of DN.

TI  - Kidney function is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in men 
      and women free of cardiovascular disease: the Framingham Heart Study.
PG  - 2017-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the risk of 
      cardiovascular disease is 10 to 20 times higher than the general population. Adults 
      with ESRD have increased coronary-artery calcification (CAC) detected by 
      electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). Because the risk of coronary heart disease 
      is increased even at moderate declines in kidney function, we sought to test whether 
      high CAC scores are seen among those with mild reductions in kidney function. 
      METHODS: Men and women free of symptomatic cardiovascular disease underwent EBCT. 
      Coronary calcium was quantified using the method described by Agatston. Renal 
      function was estimated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Spearman correlation 
      coefficients were used to test the association between GFR and CAC. RESULTS: Three 
      hundred nineteen subjects (162 men/157 women), mean age 60, were included. Mean GFR 
      was 86 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 31-169; 10% with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The 
      median CAC scores by quartile of GFR were 85.9, 48.1, 7.9, and 2.7. Overall, the 
      unadjusted correlation of GFR and CAC was -0.28 (P < 0.0001). This remained 
      significant after adjustment for age and sex (-0.11, P < 0.05), and additionally 
      after adjustment for body mass index (-0.11, P < 0.05), hypertension (-0.11, P < 
      0.05), or total cholesterol (-0.12, P= 0.04). A similar correlation was noted after 
      multivariable adjustment (-0.10, P < 0.08). CONCLUSION: Mild declines in kidney 
      function are associated with subclinical coronary artery calcification in a sample 
      of subjects free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease. This might help 
      explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease among individuals with renal 
      dysfunction. Larger ongoing studies are needed to better quantify this finding.

LID - 190
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone 
      remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also 
      a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to 
      test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. METHODS: we measured 
      serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year 
      period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, 
      patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were 
      included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 
      patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower 
      creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl 
      (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk 
      analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and 
      gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality. 
      CONCLUSION: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. 
      However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve 
      these patients survival needs to be determined.

TI  - Serum albumin, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and fetuin a as predictors of 
      malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in patients with ESRD.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum albumin (S-Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 
      (IL-6) predict malnutrition, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fetuin A, an inhibitor of 
      vascular calcification, also is associated strongly with clinical outcome in 
      patients with ESRD. In this study, multivariate analyses were performed to assess 
      these 4 biomarkers as predictors of malnutrition, CVD, and mortality in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with ESRD (54 +/- 12 years) 
      underwent measurements of S-Alb, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), plasma IL-6, and 
      fetuin A close to the start of dialysis therapy and were followed up for a median of 
      26 months (range, 1 to 66 months). Nutritional status was evaluated by means of 
      subjective global assessment. CVD was defined based on medical history. Associations 
      between biomarker levels and malnutrition, CVD, and mortality were evaluated by 
      means of receiver operating characteristic curve, logistic regression analysis, and 
      Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: All 4 biomarkers predicted malnutrition, 
      CVD, and mortality. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, showed that malnutrition was predicted best by hs-CRP and 
      IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; and mortality, by albumin and IL-6 levels. When 
      using the cutoff levels derived from receiver operating characteristics, logistic 
      regression analysis showed that only hs-CRP level (odds ratio [OR], 3.6) was 
      associated with malnutrition, and only IL-6 level (OR, 3.7) was associated with CVD. 
      Levels of S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A, but not hs-CRP, were associated with increased 
      relative risk for mortality as assessed by Cox in a model adjusting for age, sex, 
      and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analyses show that in patients with 
      ESRD, malnutrition is predicted best by hs-CRP and IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; 
      and mortality, by S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A levels, but not by hs-CRP level. This 
      comparative analysis indicates that of these biomarkers, IL-6 level may be the most 
      reliable predictor of CVD and mortality in patients with ESRD.

TI  - A cut-off value of plasma osteoprotegerin level may predict the presence of coronary 
      artery calcifications in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 3389-97
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of 
      vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular calcifications 
      are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key role in 
      bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular 
      calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors and 
      OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate cut-off value to 
      predict CAC. METHODS: A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of 
      kidney disease [75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)] were enrolled, 
      excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest multidetector 
      computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected for measurement of 
      vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation, nutrition, calcium phosphate 
      and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and these biological markers was 
      investigated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed 
      thereafter to identify a cut-off value of involved markers that best predicted the 
      presence of CAC. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, 
      among biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using 
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high FEPO(4) [OR = 
      3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high OPG levels [OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11)] were associated with 
      the presence of CAC. A protective effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D [OR = 0.20 
      (0.05-0.79)] and LDL cholesterol [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also observed. 
      ROC curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was 757.7 
      pg/mL. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated 
      with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pg/mL allow us 
      to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.

TI  - Evaluation of newer risk markers for coronary heart disease risk classification: a

PG  - 438-44
LID - 10.7326/0003-4819-156-6-201203200-00006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether newer risk markers for coronary heart disease (CHD) improve CHD 
      risk prediction remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether newer risk markers for 
      CHD risk prediction and stratification improve Framingham risk score (FRS) 
      predictions. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: The Rotterdam 
      Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 5933 asymptomatic, 
      community-dwelling participants (mean age, 69.1 years [SD, 8.5]). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Traditional CHD risk factors used in the FRS (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, 
      treatment of hypertension, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, 
      smoking, and diabetes) and newer CHD risk factors (N-terminal fragment of prohormone 
      B-type natriuretic peptide levels, von Willebrand factor antigen levels, fibrinogen 
      levels, chronic kidney disease, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein levels, 
      homocysteine levels, uric acid levels, coronary artery calcium [CAC] scores, carotid 
      intima-media thickness, peripheral arterial disease, and pulse wave velocity). 
      RESULTS: Adding CAC scores to the FRS improved the accuracy of risk predictions 
      (c-statistic increase, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06]; net reclassification index, 
      19.3% overall [39.3% in those at intermediate risk, by FRS]). Levels of N-terminal 
      fragment of prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide also improved risk predictions but 
      to a lesser extent (c-statistic increase, 0.02 [CI, 0.01 to 0.04]; net 
      reclassification index, 7.6% overall [33.0% in those at intermediate risk, by FRS]). 
      Improvements in predictions with other newer markers were marginal. LIMITATION: The 
      findings may not be generalizable to younger or nonwhite populations. CONCLUSION: 
      Among 12 CHD risk markers, improvements in FRS predictions were most statistically 
      and clinically significant with the addition of CAC scores. Further investigation is 
      needed to assess whether risk refinements using CAC scores lead to a meaningful 
      change in clinical outcome. Whether to use CAC score screening as a more routine 
      test for risk prediction requires full consideration of the financial and clinical 
      costs of performing versus not performing the test for both persons and health 
      systems. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Netherlands Organization for Health Research and

TI  - Aortic calcifications and arterial stiffness as predictors of cardiovascular events 
      in incident renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.1111/tri.12151 [doi]
AB  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. 
      Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known CV risk 
      factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine the 
      prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We 
      conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar 
      X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 
      patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 
      32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV subgroup. When 
      we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 
      unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) 
      remained an independent predictor of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using 
      receiver operating characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV 
      events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC 
      are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR population. These 
      vascular assessments are readily available and easy to perform, making them ideal 
      tools for further risk stratification. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00547040).

TI  - Fetuin-A and arterial stiffness in patients with normal kidney function.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.12.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between fetuin-A level (AHSG), its encoding gene 
      (Thr256Ser) and arterial function in subjects with normal kidney function. 
      INTRODUCTION: The aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a predictor for 
      cardiovascular mortality. Fetuin-A is a calcification inhibitor and correlates 
      negatively with increased vascular stiffness in dialysis patients. The fetuin-A 
      polymorphism (Thr256Ser) is associated with reduced fetuin levels and accelerated 
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Little is known about the role of 
      fetuin-A as an independent predictor for the development of arterial stiffness in 
      healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 116 subjects with normal kidney 
      function (age 47+/-12 years, 50 females and 66 males) of the FLEMENGHO study. 
      Calcium measurements, plasma fetuin-A, its encoding gene (Thr256Ser) and indexes of 
      arterial stiffness, such as aPWV and arterial distensibility, were determined. 
      RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aPWV (r=-0.21, p=0.029). 
      After an adjustment for multiple covariables, fetuin-A levels were independently 
      associated with aPWV (r=-0.30, p=0.022) in males but not in females. Male fetuin-A 
      SerSer carrier had lower fetuin-A levels and higher aPWV (fetuin-A: 61.9+/-29.0 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 14.3+/-0.9 m/s) as compared to ThrThr (fetuin-A: 109.9+/-54.9 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.4+/-1.3 m/s) and ThrSer carrier (fetuin-A: 100.8+/-52.5 
      microg/ml; aPWV: 6.6+/-1.3 m/s). Other calcium variables were not significantly 
      associated with arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: With respect to common calcium 
      variables, only fetuin-A level showed an inverse relation with aPWV in men with 
      normal renal function. Male fetuin-A SerSer carriers demonstrate particularly high 
      aortic stiffness, possibly implying a status of increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Patency and limb salvage rates after distal revascularization to unclampable 
      calcified outflow arteries.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe circumferential calcification of the outflow artery during 
      lower-extremity distal revascularization is considered a poor prognostic factor for 
      bypass graft patency. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 
      circumferential infrapopliteal arterial calcification on bypass graft patency and 
      limb salvage rates, comparing patency and limb salvage rates in unclampable 
      calcified distal outflow arteries with those observed in uncalcified distal outflow 
      arteries. METHODS: From July 1990 to July 1997, of 441 distal bypass graft 
      procedures performed by the same surgeon, 69 (16%, group I) involved unclampable 
      calcified outflow vessels, whereas 83 (19%, group II) outflow vessels were 
      uncalcified; the other 289 (65%) had varying intermediate degrees of calcification 
      and were not included in this analysis. All procedures were performed for 
      limb-threatening ischemia and involved standard vein patch angioplasty of the distal 
      anastomotic site, irrespective of the conduit used. Primary and secondary patency, 
      limb salvage, and survival rates were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. 
      RESULTS: Groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and atherosclerotic risk 
      factors except for a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (88% vs 65%, P =.001) and 
      renal failure (17% vs 5%, P =.01), including dialysis dependency (P =.01) in group 
      I. Gangrene as an indication for surgery was statistically more frequent in group I 
      (49% vs 29%, P =.01). The distal anastomotic locations and types of conduit involved 
      were similar in the two groups. The femoral inflow level was used more often in 
      group II (63% vs 38%, P =.003), the popliteal in group I (32% vs 17%, P =.03). 
      Follow-up ranged from 30 days to 144 months, with a mean of 69 months. None of the 
      patients were lost during the follow-up period. None of the patients died during the 
      perioperative (30-day) period. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84%, 
      65%, and 52% for group I and 89%, 76%, and 69% for group II (P =.07.). Secondary 
      patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96%, 82%, and 78% for group I and 96%, 85%, 
      and 82% for group II (P =.58). Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93%, 
      83%, and 81% for group I and 97%, 90%, and 86% for group II (P =.39). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Distal revascularization to unclampable, severely calcified outflow arteries can 
      achieve much the same results to those obtained in uncalcified outflow arteries. A 
      circumferentially calcified distal recipient artery should not be considered a major 
      obstacle to an attempt at limb salvage bypass graft surgery.

TI  - High prevalence of vertebral fractures assessed by quantitative morphometry in 
      hemodialysis patients, strongly associated with vascular calcifications.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1007/s00223-013-9722-x [doi]
AB  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) 
      and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional, 
      observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular 
      calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 ± 14.1 years, 63 % 
      males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests 
      included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and undercarboxylated), and total 
      matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for 
      the detection of VF, defined as reduction by ≥20 % of one of the vertebral body 
      dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. 
      Prevalence of VF was 55.3 % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control 
      group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; 
      OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and age (mean ± SD 66.7 ± 13.1 vs. 61.0 ± 14.7 years, 
      p < 0.001; OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The 
      prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in 
      controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association 
      with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 
      ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 
      1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion, 
      the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is high in 
      hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency is also 
      associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate 
      fractures in renal patients.

TI  - Arteriovenous fistula aneurysm in patients on regular hemodialysis: prevalence and 
      risk factors.
PG  - 94-8
LID - 10.1159/000355548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Compared to all other complications, literature data about vascular 
      access aneurysm (VAA) are the scarcest. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to 
      evaluate the prevalence of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysms and to confirm the 
      risk factors for their appearance. METHODS: The presence, number and morphological 
      characteristics of AVF aneurysms were confirmed, and according to the score of AVF 
      aneurysm (the sum of the length and width in cm), patients were classified into 
      group 1 (score ≤12) and group 2 (score >12). Analysis included the last data from 
      the medical records including vascular calcifications score. RESULTS: Out of 181 
      patients, 150 with native fistula were included in this study. Aneurysmatic changes 
      were detected in 90 (60%) patients, and the majority had two or more aneurysms. VAA 
      were more frequent in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) than in 
      other diagnostic categories. By using forward stepwise logistic regression, we 
      confirmed that patients on high-flux hemodialysis (HD) had 5.3-fold higher risk, and 
      patients with diabetes mellitus had 5.8-fold less risk for developing AVF aneurysm. 
      While vascular calcification score did not influence the incidence of VAA, higher 
      PWV had significant negative influence on formation of AVF aneurysm (OR 1.25, 95% CI 
      1.003-1.56, p = 0.047). By ROC curve analysis, it was determined that patients who 
      were longer than 5.7 years on HD had greater risk for developing VAA (area = 0.741, 
      p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: This single-center study confirmed the very high prevalence 
      of VAA (60%). Aneurysms were more frequent in patients with ADPKD and in those who 
      had longer dialysis vintage on high-flux membranes with higher blood flow rate.

TI  - Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed 
      tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0620-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular 
      disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. 
      Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these 
      measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to 
      determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for 
      cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computed tomography with contrast medium was 
      performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average 
      age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the 
      volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients 
      were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or 
      hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic 
      abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, 
      and hospitalization or death due to heart failure. RESULTS: Patients were followed 
      for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and 
      male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In 
      contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, 
      smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, 
      maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, 
      or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional 
      computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

AB  - Accurate identification of risk factors for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is 
      necessary to develop preventive strategies for this morbid disease. We investigated 
      whether baseline factors recorded at hemodialysis initiation would identify patients 
      at risk for future CUA in a matched case-control study using data from a large 
      dialysis organization. Hemodialysis patients with newly diagnosed CUA (n=1030) 
      between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014, were matched by age, sex, and race 
      in a 1:2 ratio to hemodialysis patients without CUA (n=2060). Mean ages for patients 
      and controls were 54 and 55 years, respectively; 67% of participants were women and 
      49% were white. Median duration between hemodialysis initiation and subsequent CUA 
      development was 925 days (interquartile range, 273-2185 days). In multivariable 
      conditional logistic regression analyses, diabetes mellitus; higher body mass index; 
      higher levels of serum calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone; and 
      nutritional vitamin D, cinacalcet, and warfarin treatments were associated with 
      increased odds of subsequent CUA development. Compared with patients with diabetes 
      receiving no insulin injections, those receiving insulin injections had a 
      dose-response increase in the odds of CUA involving lower abdomen and/or upper thigh 
      areas (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.51 for one or two 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 3.43 for 3 
      injections per day; odds ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.28 to 6.25 for more 
      than three injections per day), suggesting a dose-effect relationship between 
      recurrent skin trauma and CUA risk. The presence of risk factors months to years 
      before CUA development observed in this study will direct the design of preventive 
      strategies and inform CUA pathobiology.

TI  - Is fetuin-A/alpha2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein associated with the metabolic 
      syndrome in patients with chronic kidney disease?
PG  - 669-76
LID - 10.1159/000121358 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Components of the metabolic syndrome are highly prevalent in chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) patients--some of which paradoxically appear to predict an 
      improved outcome in this population. We hypothesized that the circulating 
      calcification inhibitor fetuin-A/AHSG, which is also a natural inhibitor of the 
      tyrosine kinase insulin receptor, could be one factor explaining the association 
      between increased fat mass and a survival advantage in CKD and thus conducted an 
      explorational study to provide preliminary data to support further research into 
      this hypothesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated 198 
      CKD stage 5 patients (GFR 6.8 +/- 0.2 ml/min; 62% males, mean age 52 +/- 1 years) 
      close to the start of renal replacement therapy. We studied circulating AHSG (ELISA) 
      and two common functional AHSG gene polymorphisms (at amino acids Thr248Met (C-T) 
      and Thr256Ser (C-G) using Pyrosequencing) and related these to multiple components 
      of the metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Median circulating AHSG was lower (p < 0.01) in 
      type-2 (0.22 g/l) and type-1 (0.16 g/l) diabetics as compared to non-diabetic CKD-5 
      patients (0.24 g/l). AHSG correlated with both total and truncal fat mass in type-2 
      diabetics (rho 0.37 and 0.39; p < 0.001, respectively), but not in type-1 diabetics 
      or non-diabetics. Both SNPs significantly influenced circulating levels of AHSG, and 
      were also associated with significant differences in serum triglycerides and HDL 
      cholesterol. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the prevalence of 
      metabolic syndrome criteria between the AHSG Thr256Ser (C-G) genotype groups, with a 
      more atherogenic lipid profile in AHSG high producers (Thr/Thr homozygotes). In 
      multivariate analysis, the association between circulating AHSG and fat mass 
      remained significant also after adjustment for age, gender, inflammation (CRP >10 
      mg/l), and AHSG genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The present, explorational, study supports 
      further, mechanistic, studies into a physiological link between AHSG and body fat 
      mass in patients with CKD. As we observed an association between higher fat mass and 
      elevated AHSG levels, these preliminary results may form the basis of further study 
      to establish if the observed associations may be one reason why obesity has been 
      reported to constitute a survival advantage in CKD.

AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the distribution of coronary artery calcium 
      score (CACS) by age group and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and to evaluate the 
      association between CV risk factors and CACS classification in asymptomatic adults. 
      The study included 31,545 asymptomatic Koreans, over 20 years of age with no 
      previous history of malignancy, proven coronary artery disease, or stroke, who 
      underwent CACS computed tomography at the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical 
      Center, between January 2005 and June 2013. Mean (±SD) age was 53.8 (±8.5) years 
      overall, 56.1 (±8.3) in men, and 53.3 (±8.5) in women. They were classified into 
      five groups based on their resting CACS: none (CAC = 0), minimal (0 < CAC ≤ 10), 
      mild (10 < CAC ≤ 100), moderate (100 < CAC ≤ 400), and extensive (400 > CAC). Older 
      age groups exhibited higher CACS values. The proportion of CACS classification in 
      our study was 55.5 % with no CACS, 9.5 % with minimal CACS, 19.8 % with mild CACS, 
      10.8 % with moderate CACS, and 4.3 % with extensive CACS. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) 
      were calculated for CV risk factors to determine their association with CACS. When 
      analyzed according to sex, in males, the adjusted OR for CACS increased with the 
      presence of hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, chronic kidney 
      disease, and smoking status. While, in females, the adjusted OR for CACS increased 
      with the presence of HT, DM, and obesity. CV risk factors appear to be significantly 
      associated with CACS in the Korean population.

TI  - Potential Correlation Between Circulating Fetuin-A and Pentraxin-3 With Biochemical 
      Parameters of Calcification in Hemodialysis Patients.
PG  - 752-755
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular 
      risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been 
      well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 
      3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the 
      correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective 
      upon vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: We included 84 HD patients and 
      84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this 
      study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of 
      creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive 
      protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods. RESULTS: We found that the 
      serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P 
      in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum 
      levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, 
      fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as 
      duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 
      and PTH was significant only in the patient group. CONCLUSION: In this study, 
      increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. 
      According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable 
      markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

TI  - Inflammation, mineral metabolism and progressive coronary artery calcification in 
      patients on haemodialysis.
PG  - 1915-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and common 
      complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this study 
      was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a 2-year period and to identify 
      the factors that may be associated with CAC progression in ESRD patients. METHODS: 
      The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable haemodialysis patients who 
      initially entered into the study. The study population underwent multirow spiral 
      computed tomography to derive CAC scores at baseline and after a minimum of 12 
      months (24 months in 30 patients, 18 months in four, and 12 months in the remaining 
      six patients). To provide a stable estimate that was unbiased with respect to the 
      baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores were used for the analyses of the 
      changes in CAC. RESULTS: The median CAC score was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm3 at 
      baseline and increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm3 at follow-up (P < 0.001) and the 
      median annualized change in square root-transformed CAC score was 1.48 (range, 
      -0.95-8.64) mm3/year. The annualized change of the square root-transformed CAC score 
      positively correlated with the time-integrated levels of C-reactive protein (R = 
      0.521, P = 0.001), phosphorus (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x phosphorus 
      product (R = 0.394, P = 0.012), but did not correlate with the levels of fetuin-A or 
      lipid parameters. Even after adjusting for age, gender and baseline CAC score, 
      C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with CAC progression. 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that chronic inflammation as well as altered mineral 
      metabolism contributes to a rapid progression of CAC in ESRD patients. Additional, 
      larger scale studies are required to confirm our findings.

TI  - Low fetuin-A levels are associated with cardiovascular death: Impact of variations 
      in the gene encoding fetuin.
PG  - 2383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
      patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
      observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory 
      glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation 
      and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association 
      between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin 
      gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome. METHODS: In a cohort 
      of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement therapy [glomerular 
      filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years the following 
      parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), 
      comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], 
      carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid 
      positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser (C-->G), Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys 
      (C-->T). RESULTS: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) 
      mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking, 
      diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 
      0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had 
      significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD 
      patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N= 101), fetuin-A was 
      significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques 
      independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and inflammation. 
      Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both S-albumin (Rho = 
      0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser 
      allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular 
      mortality rate if they were inflamed. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that a low 
      fetuin-A level is associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis 
      (carotid plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 
      Because the present study demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on 
      both circulating fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with 
      the AHSG 256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.

AB  - While all mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) are unknown, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be 
      involved in this process in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the association between ACE2 and CAC in patients on MHD 
      therapy. Ninety patients on MHD therapy were involved in this prospective study. CAC 
      was quantified by CAC score (CACs) using the Agatston method and a multi-slice CT 
      scanner. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the 
      association between ACE2 and CACs. In the univariate analysis, CACs positively 
      correlated with ACE2 (r = 0.666, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, 
      hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, ACE2 levels 
      continued to significantly and independently predict the presence of CAC. ROC curve 
      analysis showed that the serum ACE2 level can predict the extent of CAC. These 
      findings indicate that elevated serum ACE2 may be involved in vascular calcification 
      in patients receiving MHD therapy.

TI  - Circulating sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) in predialysis chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD): relationship with bone density and arterial stiffness.
PG  - 473-80
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9595-4 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. The 
      Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in 
      CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to investigate the 
      possible association of circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signaling 
      inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in predialysis CKD. 
      Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B 
      (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were 
      analyzed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip 
      (TH), and forearm (FARM). Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour 
      analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between 
      sclerostin and age (r = 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p 
      = 0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association 
      between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between 
      sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In 
      contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative 
      association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the 
      Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to 
      establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in 
      CKD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen on 
      mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary CT as it may 
      serve as a potential marker for increased risk of developing symptomatic coronary 
      artery disease (CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the imaging 
      database at our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent coronary CT 
      within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary calcium score on 
      CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification by weighted value assigned to 
      its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for all lesions and expressed as Agaston 
      score. Calculated scores were risk stratified for developing CAD as follows: 0-no 
      risk; 1-10-minimal; 11-100-mild; 101-400-moderate; >400-high risk. Percentile 
      distribution of calcium score adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based 
      on results of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which excluded 
      patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms were reviewed by 
      MQSA-certified breast radiologists who were blinded to patients' coronary calcium 
      scores. Mammograms were interpreted for presence or absence of BAC. The calcium 
      scores and corresponding percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography. 
      Cardiac risk factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history 
      of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: BAC correlated with 
      coronary calcium score of >11 (p=0.0001), corresponding to mild or greater risk of 
      developing CAD. Specifically, coronary calcium score of >11 was seen in 68% (25/37) 
      of patients with BAC and 31% (34/108) of patients without BAC. Accounting for race, 
      gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically significant correlation with 
      percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4% (19/27) of patients with BAC vs. 44.6% 
      (41/92) of patient without BAC showed percentile score of >25 for developing CAD. 
      Statistically significant association was observed of BAC with diabetes (p=0.01) and 
      chronic renal disease (p=0.005). BAC showed no significant associated with 
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD. CONCLUSION: BAC 
      does predict coronary artery calcium score of >11, which indicates mild or greater 
      risk of developing CAD. In addition, statistically significant correlation exists 
      between BAC and cardiac risk factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our 
      study suggests that BAC on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker for 
      increased risk of developing CAD.

TI  - Association of inflammation and malnutrition with cardiac valve calcification in 
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 1927-36
AB  - Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has long been regarded as a consequence of aging 
      and abnormal calcium-phosphate metabolism in uremic patients. In view of the recent 
      recognition of association among inflammation, malnutrition, and atherosclerosis, 
      the possible role of inflammation and malnutrition in VC was investigated. 
      Inflammatory markers (including C-reactive protein [CRP], fibrinogen, and basal 
      metabolic rate) and nutritional status (assessed using serum albumin, subjective 
      global nutrition assessment, and handgrip strength) were examined, in addition to 
      calcium phosphate parameters and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
      including gender, smoking habits, BP, and lipid profile, in relation to VC in 137 
      patients who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Compared with 
      patients with no VC, patients with VC not only were older (60 [10] versus 54 [12] 
      yr; P = 0.005), had higher plasma phosphate (1.89 [0.52] versus 1.64 [0.41] mmol/L; 
      P = 0.003), and had higher parathyroid hormone (83 [40, 145] versus 38 [16, 71] 
      pmol/L; P = 0.001) but also had higher CRP (4.5 [0.1, 13.4] versus 0.2 [0.1, 4.4] 
      mg/L; P = 0.004), had higher fibrinogen (6.6 [1.9] versus 5.7 [1.3] g/L; P = 0.002), 
      and had lower serum albumin (26 [4] versus 29 [3] g/L; P = 0004). Twenty-three 
      percent of patients with VC versus 17% of patients with no VC were moderately to 
      severely malnourished according to subjective global nutrition assessment (P = 
      0.05). Even after adjustment for patients' age, duration of continuous ambulatory 
      peritoneal dialysis, diabetes, and calcium x phosphate product, cardiac VC remained 
      strongly associated with CRP (odds ratio, 1.05; P = 0.026) and albumin (odds ratio, 
      0.85; P = 0.01). The data suggest that VC not only is a passive degenerative process 
      but also involves active inflammation, similar to that seen in atherosclerosis. The 
      presence of uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism further 
      accelerates the progression of calcification. The data also indicate that VC and 
      atherosclerosis should be considered as associated syndromes, sharing similar 
      pathogenic mechanisms, namely active inflammation.

TI  - Observational multicenter study to evaluate the prevalence and prognosis of 
      subclinical atheromatosis in a Spanish chronic kidney disease cohort: baseline data 
      from the NEFRONA study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events (CVE) are more prevalent in chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of morbimortality. Specific 
      risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional factors do not 
      fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of 
      atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The potential use 
      of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis has to be determined. 
      METHODS: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were 
      enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. 
      Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no 
      previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were also recruited. Demographical, clinical and 
      analytical data were collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a 
      single trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect 
      atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured. RESULTS: Differences 
      in age, sex and prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found 
      between controls and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described 
      in epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls 
      and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted); 
      earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of atheromatous 
      plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted analysis. A group of 
      patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, 
      and would have gone underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of 
      pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages, 
      and a higher rate of ABI >1.4 than <0.9, suggesting more vascular calcification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual prevalence of 
      subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of 
      atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important 
      information to the pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to 
      non-CKD subjects.

AB  - The study of thyroid nodules in hemodialyzed patients using ultrasonography has been 
      described in a limited number of reports. The thyroid glands of 143 patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis were examined by ultrasonography using 
      frequency probes. Although a goiter (thyroid volume > 20 mL) was observed in only 20 
      patients (14%), nodular lesions of the thyroid gland were more frequent and found in 
      85 patients (59.4%), especially in female patients (42 patients, 72.4%). The 
      etiology of thyroid nodular lesions was as follows: cyst in 43 (30.0%), adenomatous 
      goiter in 14 (9.8%), adenoma in 11 (7.7%), hypoechoic lesion in 17 (11.9%), and 
      intrathyroid calcification in 8 (5.6%). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration 
      cytology was performed in 5 patients, but no abnormal cells were found. Compared to 
      patients without nodules, the age was higher in patients with cysts (54 +/- 15 vs. 
      63 +/- 13 years; P < 0.05) and hypoechoic lesions (70 +/- 13 years; P < 0.05). The 
      serum thyroglobulin level was higher in patients with adenomatous goiters (26 +/- 28 
      vs. 148 +/- 166 ng/mL; P < 0.05). The thyroid volume was greater in patients with 
      adenomatous goiters (14.2 +/- 5.7 vs. 19.0 +/- 7.3 mL; P < 0.05) and adenomas (18.2 
      +/- 6.7 mL; P < 0.05). In conclusion, patients undergoing hemodialysis frequently 
      develop thyroid abnormalities and ultrasonography is a useful imaging modality to 
      identify these lesions.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and mortality in diabetic patients with proteinuria.
PG  - 1107-14
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.70 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk 
      associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and 
      often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the 
      prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 
      diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric 
      diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). 
      Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was 
      diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, 
      male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, 
      serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an 
      average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the 
      severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on 
      both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of 
      calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the 
      severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney 
      disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need 
      to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification 
      in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

TI  - Development of a cardiovascular calcification index using simple imaging tools in 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 508-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in haemodialysis 
      patients and is associated with cardiovascular outcomes. Though cardiac computed 
      tomography (CCT) is accurate, it is not widely available. METHODS: We developed a 
      cardiovascular calcification index (CCI) to predict the presence of CAC for 
      haemodialysis patients using simple in-office techniques. Prevalent haemodialysis 
      patients (n = 140) underwent CCT imaging for CAC, a lateral abdominal X-ray for 
      calcification of the abdominal aorta, an echocardiogram for valvular calcification, 
      and pulse pressure measurement. A CCI was derived by weighting the prevalence rate 
      ratios of CAC > or =1000. Using bootstrap techniques, validation was performed using 
      receiver operator characteristic curves and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Points were 
      assigned for patients' age (60-69 and > or =70 years, 1 and 2 points, respectively), 
      dialysis vintage > or =2 years (1 point), aortic and mitral valve calcification (3 
      and 1 points, respectively), and abdominal aorta X-ray scores of 1-6 and > or =7 (2 
      and 4 points, respectively). Race, sex and pulse pressure did not contribute to the 
      CCI. The CCI ranged from 0 to 11 points. The likelihood ratio of CAC > or =1000 
      associated with CCI scores of 2-4, 5, 6-8 and 9-11 were 1.28, 2.03, 2.94 and 3.83, 
      respectively. Given the prevalence of CAC > or =1000 of 21% in the current study, 
      the probability of having CAC > or =1000 was 26%, 38%, 43% and 50% for participants 
      with CCI scores of 2-4, 5, 6-8, and > or =9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      refinement is needed, the CCI developed in the current study provides an alternative 
      for predicting CAC when CCT is not available.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with 
      the presence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients with type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 consecutive T1D patients without 
      coronary artery disease, with at least 5 years of diabetes and absence of end-stage 
      renal disease. Mean age was 38 ± 10 years and 57% were males. CAC score was measured 
      by multidetector computed tomography (Siemens Sensation 64 Cardiac). The insulin 
      resistance index was measured using the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR). The 
      eGDR was lower among CAC-positive patients than among CAC-negative patients, 
      suggesting an increased insulin resistance. In a logistic regression model adjusted 
      for age (at 10-year intervals), eGDR, diabetic nephropathy and gender, CAC was 
      associated with age [OR = 2.73 (95%CI = 1.53-4.86), P = 0.001] and with eGDR [OR = 
      0.08 (95%CI = 0.02-0.21), P = 0.004]. In T1D subjects, insulin resistance is one of 
      the most important risk factors for subclinical atherosclerosis.

TI  - Human uraemic serum displays calcific potential in vitro that increases with 
      advancing chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 237-45
LID - 10.1042/CS20120638 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) strongly correlates with declining renal function and 
      contributes to the high morbidity and mortality of patients with CKD (chronic kidney 
      disease). It is closely regulated by circulating factors but little is known about 
      the capacity of serum from patients to induce calcification outside the disease 
      setting, which we now define as the calcific potential of serum. We have therefore 
      examined the ability of serum from age- and sex-matched subjects with and without 
      advancing CKD to induce calcification of cultured SMCs (smooth muscle cells). 
      Samples from patients with CKD induced significant calcification compared with 
      controls. More importantly, samples from patients on haemodialysis induced 
      significantly higher calcification than those with moderate or advanced CKD. The 
      calcification induced by the latter two but not those on haemodialysis could be 
      enhanced with calcium chloride and β-GP (β-glycerophosphate). A positive correlation 
      was evident between measured serum creatinine, phosphate, PTH (parathyroid hormone), 
      OPG (osteoprotegerin) and the degree of calcification in vitro. eGFR (estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), haemoglobin and serum 
      albumin correlated negatively. Stepwise multivariate analysis of log-transformed 
      calcific potential data highlighted serum creatinine, albumin and OPG as significant 
      predictors, explaining approximately 50% of the variation. Thus, other regulators, 
      either not investigated or as yet unidentified, may contribute to the calcification 
      potential of serum in vitro. Furthermore, uraemic serum can induce graded 
      calcification outside of the disease milieu that reflects the degree of kidney 
      impairment in vivo. These findings could have important clinical relevance in terms 
      of developing novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for subjects with CKD.

TI  - Plasma osteoprotegerin, arterial stiffness, and mortality in normoalbuminemic 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1695-701
LID - 10.1007/s00198-010-1377-0 [doi]
AB  - A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor for vascular 
      calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. OPG and pulse wave velocity 
      (PWV) were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (>3 years) 
      Japanese hemodialysis patients who were prospectively followed for 6 years. In 
      long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, OPG levels were strongly 
      linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome. INTRODUCTION: A high 
      circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for vascular calcification and 
      mortality in Western chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients but it is not known if 
      this is true for Japanese CKD patients, where a different risk profile may operate. 
      METHODS: OPG and PWV were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term 
      (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients (median age 62 years) who were 
      prospectively followed for 6 years. RESULTS: OPG levels were associated in 
      multivariate analysis with age, dialysis vintage, history of cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD) and parathyroid hormone levels. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate 
      with OPG. Patients with clinical history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels 
      and OPG levels were positively correlated to PWV, an index of arterial stiffness. 
      These associations were independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes. 
      During the follow-up period, 40 deaths, including 25 cardiovascular deaths, were 
      recorded. In crude analysis, each unit of increase in OPG was associated with 
      increased all-cause (hazard ratios 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD 
      mortality (1.14 [1.07-1.21]), which persisted after adjustment for age, sex, 
      dialysis vintage, diabetes, and baseline CVD (1.12 [1.05-1.19] and 1.11 [1.02-1.19], 
      all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In long-term 
      normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, with low prevalence of 
      inflammation, OPG levels were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse 
      outcome.

TI  - Serum Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase-5b Levels are Associated with the Severity 
      and Extent of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.
PG  - 1058-1068
LID - 10.5551/jat.39339 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are 
      specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated 
      with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the severity 
      of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in 
      patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on 
      coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 71 CAD 
      patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) and 28 age- and gender- 
      matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker 
      of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the 
      extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were 
      measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were classified into quartiles. 
      RESULTS: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in 
      healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and 
      Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were 
      associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear 
      regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or 
      the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b 
      level. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly 
      associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary 
      atherosclerosis in CAD patients.

TI  - Matrix GLA protein gene polymorphisms: clinical correlates and cardiovascular 
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased vascular calcification plays an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It 
      is the result of an active ossification process counteracted by 'protective' 
      proteins, such as matrix GLA protein (MGP). Polymorphisms of MGP have been 
      identified. METHODS: The aim of this study was to define the distribution of two MGP 
      polymorphisms (-7, -138) in 99 hemodialysis (HD) patients, in 26 patients with CKD 
      stage 3 and in 135 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were followed up 
      for 12 months to record any cardiovascular deaths. The cause of death was determined 
      by medical doctors, considering the medical history of each patient. The primers 
      were designed with Primer Express software. RESULTS: MGP -138TT homozygotes were 
      more frequent in the HD group versus controls (p = 0.0004). Additionally, the 
      frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in the HD group (p = 0.0006). The 
      frequency of the A allele of MGP-7 was significantly higher both in the HD group (p 
      = 0.033) and in the CKD group (p = 0.0017) versus controls. MGP-7 GG homozygotes 
      were significantly less common in the CKD group than in controls (p = 0.037). 
      Combination -138TT -7AA was significantly more frequent in both CKD patients (p = 
      0.001) and in HD patients (p = 0.029) than in controls. Seventeen out of 99 HD 
      patients experienced fatal cardiovascular events. Sixteen (94.1%) were -138TT 
      homozygotes and either -7AA homozygotes or -7GA heterozygotes. CONCLUSION: This 
      study suggests that CKD and HD patients have a different distribution of MGP gene 
      polymorphism as compared with the normal population. Altered MGP gene polymorphism 
      may be a negative prognostic factor for the progression to end-stage renal disease 
      and for cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

TI  - Association of coronary artery calcium score and vascular dysfunction in long-term 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of 
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of 
      digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with the 
      severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We hypothesized that 
      in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score have a 
      gradient association that follows that of subjects without kidney disease. We 
      examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group of long-term 
      hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart. Area under the 
      curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index of vascular 
      function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia test. Coronary 
      calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography or multidetector 
      computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited hemodialysis patients 
      (age: 58 ± 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and gender-matched controls. In 
      hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was significantly worse (114 ± 72 vs. 
      143 ± 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was higher (525 ± 425 vs. 240 ± 332, P < 0.001). 
      Hemodialysis patients were 14 times more likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared 
      with controls. After adjustment for known confounders, the relative risk for case 
      vs. control for each standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence 
      interval: 1.12-1.93, P = 0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM 
      technology is incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in 
      whom both measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The 
      DTM technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify 
      hemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening syndrome marked by vascular 
      calcification and cutaneous necrosis. The role of radiographic imaging in assisting 
      in diagnosis has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role 
      of plain radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of calciphylaxis. METHODS: We 
      searched for cases of patients at our tertiary referral center with a diagnosis of 
      calciphylaxis between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2010. Two control patients receiving 
      dialysis but without calciphylaxis were age- and sex-matched to each study patient. 
      Plain radiographs were obtained from the date closest to diagnosis in patients with 
      calciphylaxis and from matched controls at approximately the same dates. Two 
      radiologists, masked as to cases and controls, read each image together. Size of 
      calcified vessels, pattern and extent of calcifications, presence of net-like or 
      other calcifications, and bone density/mineralization were recorded and analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with calciphylaxis (mean age, 57 years; 21 [72%] 
      women) were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 36-75 years). 
      Compared with those of controls, plain radiographs of patients with calciphylaxis 
      had more vascular calcifications, more small-vessel calcifications, and a netlike 
      pattern of calcifications. A netlike pattern of calcifications had considerable 
      strength of association with calciphylaxis (odds ratio, 9.4) and a specificity of 
      nearly 90%. These findings were preserved even if only one image was used per 
      patient. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study. CONCLUSION: A netlike pattern 
      of calcifications on plain radiographs was more common in patients with 
      calciphylaxis and may aid in diagnosis.

      patients.
PG  - 257-63
LID - 10.1159/000157629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular 
      events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement of 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the incidence of 
      cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients. METHODS: We conducted a 
      prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with morbidity and 
      mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 and May 2006. 
      RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 34 female) were 
      prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this period, 27 patients 
      developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related to cardiovascular 
      disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the high OPG group 
      showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with 
      the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis associated the new onset of 
      cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 
      0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start of HD was significantly 
      associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic calcification index. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients may predict subsequent 
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - [Calciphylaxis: fatal complication of cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with end 
      stage kidney disease].
PG  - 32-6
AB  - Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to subcutaneous small 
      arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but usually fatal. Disorders of calcium 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in dialysis patients but 
      calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we 
      proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development. METHODS: We 
      studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis in our service from 
      january 2001 to december 2006. RESULTS: All patients were female with mean age at 
      diagnosis 68.5+/-6.7 years. All patients were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 
      patients had been receiving hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had 
      diabetes mellitus type II and all patients were obese (BMI >25 kg/m2). All patients 
      had metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were 
      receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn t have severe 
      alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus <55. All 
      patients developed low blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment 
      (98.3+/-22.7/60+/-18,29 mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions 
      like abdomen and thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in 
      arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, 
      seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, 
      without specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes 
      mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low 
      blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to develop 
      calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In these 
      patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis, dialysis 
      hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia of 
      subcutaneous adipose tissue.

TI  - Is low magnesium a clue to arteriovenous fistula complications in hemodialysis?
PG  - 773-9
LID - 10.1007/s11255-015-1207-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnesium insufficiency is a pro-atherogenic factor involved in endothelial 
      dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and vascular calcification. Our aim was to examine the 
      role of magnesium in the development of arteriovenous fistula complications in 
      hemodialysis. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical investigation of data from 
      88 patients who were divided into two groups: those with and without arteriovenous 
      fistula complications. We examined the influence of sex, demographics, and clinical 
      and laboratory parameters. The existence of fistula stenosis was determined by 
      measuring Doppler flow, while B-mode ultrasound was used to detect plaques and 
      evaluate the carotid artery intima-media thickness. RESULTS: Patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications had significantly higher leukocyte counts (p = 
      0.03), platelet counts (p = 0.03), phosphate concentrations (p = 0.044), and 
      alkaline phosphatase concentrations (p = 0.04). Patients without complications had 
      significantly greater blood flow through the arteriovenous fistula (p < 0.0005), 
      higher magnesium concentrations (p = 0.004), and a lower carotid artery intima-media 
      thickness (p = 0.037). The magnesium level was inversely correlated with leukocyte 
      (p = 0.028) and platelet (p = 0.016) counts. The magnesium concentration was 
      significantly lower in patients with carotid artery plaques (p = 0.03). Multiple 
      linear regression, using magnesium as the dependent variable in patients with 
      arteriovenous fistula complications, indicated statistically significant 
      correlations with platelet (p = 0.005) and leukocyte (p = 0.027) counts and carotid 
      plaques (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Hypomagnesemia is a significant pro-atherogenic 
      factor and an important predictor of arteriovenous fistula complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Calcification of the mitral and aortic valves is common 
      in dialysis patients (CKD-5D). However, the prognostic significance of valvular 
      calcification (VC) in CKD is not well established. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & 
      MEASUREMENTS: 144 adult CKD-5D patients underwent bidimensional echocardiography for 
      qualitative assessment of VC and cardiac computed tomography (CT) for quantification 
      of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and VC. The patients were followed for a median of 
      5.6 years for mortality from all causes. RESULTS: Overall, 38.2% of patients had 
      mitral VC and 44.4% had aortic VC on echocardiography. Patients with VC were older 
      and less likely to be African American; all other characteristics were similar 
      between groups. The mortality rate of patients with calcification of either valve 
      was higher than for patients without VC. After adjustment for age, gender, race, 
      diabetes mellitus, and history of atherosclerotic disease, only mitral VC remained 
      independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 2.91). Patients with calcification of both valves 
      had a two-fold increased risk of death during follow-up compared with patients 
      without VC (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.14 to 4.08). A combined CT score of VC and CAC was 
      strongly associated with all-cause mortality during follow-up (HR for highest versus 
      lowest tertile, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.54). CONCLUSIONS: VC is associated with a 
      significantly increased risk for all-cause mortality in CKD-5D patients. These 
      findings support the use of echocardiography for risk stratification in CKD-5D as 
      recently suggested in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines.

TI  - Higher serum sclerostin levels and insufficiency of vitamin D are strongly 
      associated with vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients: a case control study.
PG  - 577-584
LID - 10.1007/s00198-016-3770-9 [doi]
AB  - In hemodialysis patients, vertebral fractures were associated with elevated 
      sclerostin levels, suggesting that sclerostin could reflect bone fragility in these 
      patients. INTRODUCTION: Fragility fractures are common in hemodialysis patients. The 
      aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of vertebral fracture and analyze 
      associations between sclerostin serum levels and vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: Ninety-two hemodialysis patients and 100 controls matched for age 
      and sex were studied. Bone mineral density was measured by ultrasonography at 
      non-dominant heel. The markers of bone turnover included serum osteocalcin, 
      C-terminal telopeptide, and sclerostin. All participants underwent radiography of 
      the thoracic and lumbar spine to ascertain the presence of vertebral fractures. 
      RESULTS: Bone ultrasound parameters at calcaneus were significantly lower in 
      hemodialysis patients compared with controls; bone turnover markers and parathyroid 
      hormone level were significantly higher, while serum of 25-OH-D3 was significantly 
      lower in hemodialysis group. One or more moderate or severe vertebral fractures were 
      found in 38 hemodialysis patients, whereas in control group, 10 patients had a 
      vertebral fracture. In hemodialysis group, the comparison between patients with and 
      without vertebral fractures showed that the patients with vertebral fractures had 
      the serum sclerostin levels statistically higher than patients without vertebral, 
      while serum levels of 25-OH-D3 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral 
      fractures compared to the patients without vertebral fractures. Multivariate 
      analysis disclosed that sclerostin levels were associated with an increased risk of 
      vertebral fractures in hemodialysis patients after adjusting for multiple variables. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows high prevalence of vertebral fractures in hemodialysis 
      patients and that it is associated with elevated sclerostin levels, reflecting bone 
      fragility in these patients.

TI  - Peritoneal dialysis per se is a risk factor for sclerostin-associated adynamic bone 
      disease.
PG  - 1039-45
LID - 10.1038/ki.2014.372 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome 
      influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and 
      dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only 
      a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older 
      studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy 
      in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease 
      (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a 
      Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) 
      and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and 
      specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between 
      nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, 
      and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone 
      mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic 
      bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. 
      Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and 
      bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these 
      patients.

TI  - Factors associated with calcification of the abdominal aorta in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - S238-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injury caused by arteriosclerosis has 
      been the major cause of the death in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We quantitatively 
      analyzed and evaluated the severity of abdominal aortic calcification in HD patients 
      in comparison to risk factors for arteriosclerosis. METHODS: One hundred 
      thirty-seven HD patients were examined. Using image analysis software, areas of the 
      calcified abdominal aorta were quantitatively analyzed on plain computerized 
      tomography images. Other factors such as blood pressure (BP), lipid levels, and 
      calcium (Ca) x phosphorus (Pi) value were also analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with a 
      higher one-year average of systolic BP showed a higher severity of abdominal aortic 
      calcification. That is, the severity of abdominal aortic calcification in patients 
      with a one-year systolic BP average above 160 mm Hg was 31.5 +/- 13.6%, and this 
      severity was significantly higher than that in patients with a one-year systolic BP 
      average of less than 120 mm Hg (8.0 +/- 7.7%, P < 0.01). The severity of abdominal 
      aortic calcification in patients demonstrating risk values of ectopic calcification, 
      that is serum Ca x Pi > or = 60 (mg/dl), on more than 4 of 24 measurements within 
      one year (25.8 +/- 13.6%) was significantly higher than the severity of aortic 
      calcification in patients demonstrating this value less than four times in one year 
      (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between levels of low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein(a), and 
      severity of abdominal aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic BP levels and the 
      product of serum Ca and Pi were related to the severity of abdominal aortic 
      calcification in HD patients. These observations suggested that BP control, as well 
      as control of serum Ca and Pi levels, was important in preventing the progression of 
      abdominal aortic arteriosclerosis.

TI  - Normal body mass index with central obesity has increased risk of coronary artery 
      calcification in Korean patients with chronic kidney disease.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD), overweight and mild obesity have shown the lowest 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk. However, central obesity has been directly associated with 
      CV risk in these patients. This bidirectional relationship of body mass index (BMI) 
      and central obesity prompted us to evaluate CV risk based on a combination of BMI 
      and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in nondialysis CKD patients. We included 1078 patients 
      with CKD stage 2 through 5 (nondialysis) enrolled in a nationwide prospective cohort 
      of Korea. Patients were divided into 3 groups by BMI (normal BMI, 18.5-22.9; 
      overweight, 23.0-27.4; and obese, 27.5 and over kg/m(2)) and were dichotomized by a 
      sex-specific median WHR (0.92 in males and 0.88 in females). Coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) was determined by multislice computed tomography. CAC (score 
      above 10 Agatston units) was found in 477 patients. Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis indicated that BMI was not independently associated with CAC. However, WHR 
      showed an independent linear and significant association with CAC (odds ratio, 
      1.036; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.065 per 0.01 increase). Furthermore, when 
      patients were categorized into 6 groups according to a combination of BMI and WHR, 
      normal BMI but higher WHR had the highest risk of CAC compared with the normal BMI 
      with lower WHR group (2.104; 1.074-4.121). Thus, a normal BMI with central obesity 
      was associated with the highest risk of CAC, suggesting that considering BMI and 
      WHR, 2 surrogates of obesity, can help to discriminate CV risk in Korean nondialysis 
      CKD patients.

TI  - The link between bone and coronary calcifications in CKD-5 patients on 
      haemodialysis.
PG  - 1010-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current study was designed to evaluate 
      the associations between bone turnover/volume and coronary artery calcifications 
      (CAC). METHODS: In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multislice computed tomography 
      of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant biochemical parameters were 
      done. The large number of CKD-5 patients enrolled allowed separate evaluation of 
      patients with CAC versus patients without CAC and adjustment for traditional and 
      non-traditional risk factors for CAC. RESULTS: When all patients were analysed, 
      associations were found between CAC and bone turnover, bone volume, age, gender and 
      dialysis vintage. When only patients with CAC were included, there was a U-shaped 
      relationship between CAC and bone turnover, whilst the association with bone volume 
      was lost. In these patients, the relationship of CAC with age, gender and dialysis 
      vintage remained. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender 
      and dialysis vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal 
      osteodystrophy amenable to treatment should be considered in the management of 
      patients with CAC.

TI  - Prevention of osteitis fibrosa, aluminium bone disease and soft-tissue calcification 
      in dialysis patients: a long-term comparison of moderate doses of oral calcium +/- 
      Mg(OH)2 vs Al(OH)3 +/- 1 alpha OH vitamin D3.
PG  - 1045-53
AB  - Since 1980, moderately large doses of oral calcium (80 +/- 35 mmol/day as CaCO3 +/- 
      calcium polystyrene sulphonate), in association if necessary with Mg(OH)2 (2.5 +/- 1 
      g/day), with a reduction in the dialysate Mg concentrations from 0.75 to 0.375 
      mmol/24 h, have replaced A1(OH)3 as phosphate binders in our centre. A1(OH)3 was 
      previously given to our haemodialysis patients in association with small doses of Ca 
      CO3 (less than or equal to 3 g/day) and if necessary with 1 alpha OH vitamin D3. To 
      compare the long-term efficacy of this new approach with the former one in the 
      prevention of renal osteodystrophy and soft-tissue calcification, 32 current 
      patients were selected on the basis of at least 24 months of treatment in our centre 
      and availability of a yearly bone survey (profile of lumbar spine and 
      anteroposterior view of the pelvis, shoulders and hands). A group of 30 patients 
      treated before 1980 were then selected on the same criteria and matched for age, 
      sex, and duration on dialysis. Linear calcifications of the anterior and posterior 
      walls of the aorta in front of L2, L3, L4 and on the lateral walls of the iliac and 
      femoral arteries were measured and the para-articular calcifications and 
      subperiosteal resorptions of the hands evaluated. The initial extent and the 
      subsequent increase of the ocular and para-articular calcification were comparable 
      in the two groups. Plasma alkaline phosphatase was stable in the normal range in 
      both groups, as was plasma concentration of calcium. Plasma phosphate was slightly 
      elevated (1.7 mmol/l) but stable and comparable in the two groups.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Vascular access calcification predicts mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1582-7
LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.458 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in 
      patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk 
      factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this 
      disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 
      49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or 
      synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of 
      time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by 
      logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently 
      related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality 
      risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was 
      an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular 
      access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased 
      mortality risk.

TI  - Peri-aortic fat tissue thickness in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 316-24
LID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic peri-aortic fat tissue (PFT) and epicardial adipose tissue 
      (EAT) are metabolically active visceral fat deposits surrounding the thoracic aorta 
      and the heart, respectively. Various studies have demonstrated a positive predictive 
      value of both PFT and EAT for coronary artery disease in the general population. In 
      the present study, we aimed to investigate PFT thickness and the independent 
      predictors of PFT in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. ♢ METHODS: Our 
      cross-sectional study enrolled 35 PD patients (10 women, 25 men) and 30 
      age-and-sex-matched healthy subjects (15 women, 15 men). We measured PFT, thoracic 
      artery calcification (TAC), EAT, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) by 
      electrocardiogram-gated 64-multi-detector computed tomography. ♢ RESULTS: The 
      measured PFT, EAT, CAC, and TAC were significantly higher in the PD group than in 
      the healthy subjects (p < 0.05 each). In the PD group, PFT and TAC were 
      significantly correlated (r = 0.33, p = 0.007). Also, PFT measurements were 
      positively correlated with EAT and total CAC in the PD and the control group alike 
      (r = 0.58, p = 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.01 respectively). A stepwise linear 
      regression analysis revealed that age, duration of hypertension, and being a PD 
      patient were independent predictors of PFT. ♢ CONCLUSIONS: Measured PFT was higher 
      in PD patients than in healthy subjects and, in the PD population, was also shown to 
      be related to calcification scores and EAT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
      understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
      importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular 
      calcification (VC), on survival. METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis 
      (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors 
      completed 40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the 
      superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard 
      clinical biochemical analysis. RESULTS: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had 
      died (27 men and 4 women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The 
      majority of deaths were in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD 
      subjects. The outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate 
      logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 
      0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 0.26 
      (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSION: We 
      have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in CKD stages 4 and 5 
      over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, independent of CRP, is 
      also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated; 
      however, it is likely that they are associated with vascular damage through 
      mechanisms in addition to VC.

TI  - Impact of vascular calcifications on arteriovenous fistula survival in hemodialysis 
      patients: a five-year follow-up.
PG  - 247-52
LID - 10.1159/000380823 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis 
      patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The aim 
      of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications may have 
      on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival. METHODS: This study included 90 
      patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic 
      hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular calcification scores 
      ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access calcification score); patients 
      were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and 
      severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 
      5 years after calcification measurement or until the patient's 
      death/transplantation. RESULTS: Patients with more pronounced vascular 
      calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression 
      analysis showed a significant relationship between calcification score and male 
      gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and 
      intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal 
      differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification 
      scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 
      3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 
      (CI 0.97-22.38). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse 
      survival of native arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.

TI  - Transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal suprarenal cross-clamping for repair of 
      abdominal aortic aneurysm with a hostile infrarenal aortic neck.
PG  - 687-94
AB  - Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) with a hostile infrarenal aortic neck 
      unfit for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are more likely to require open repair 
      with suprarenal aortic cross-clamping. We compared the results of the 
      transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal approaches for repair of infrarenal AAA 
      requiring suprarenal cross-clamping and the relative frequency of such techniques 
      after incorporating EVAR into our clinical practice. From January 1998 through 
      September 2005, 478 elective infrarenal aortic aneurysms were repaired. There were 
      160 (33%) open repairs (71% transperitoneal and 29% retroperitoneal) and 318 (67%) 
      endovascular repairs. In 38 cases (24%) suprarenal cross-clamping was performed (47% 
      transperitoneal and 53% retroperitoneal incisions) for a hostile infrarenal neck. A 
      hostile aortic neck was defined as severe angulation (>60 degrees ), short neck (<15 
      mm), extensive calcification, or circumferential thrombus. The median age was 70 
      years; 47% were men; 16% had diabetes mellitus, 29% pulmonary disease, 53% coronary 
      artery disease, and 11% renal insufficiency. The median aneurysm size was 6.0 cm. A 
      retrospective analysis was performed to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes 
      between the trans- and retroperitoneal patient cohorts. The results were determined 
      for two time periods to assess whether open repair with suprarenal cross- clamping 
      was being performed more frequently as a result of increased utilization of EVAR in 
      the contemporary period. After 2002, EVAR increased from 60% to 71% (p = 0.04) while 
      open repair declined from 40% to 29% (p = 0.01). The retroperitoneal approach 
      doubled from 19% to 39%, while the transperitoneal approach decreased from 81% to 
      61% (p = 0.02). Suprarenal cross-clamping increased by 11% after 2002. There was no 
      significant difference in age, sex, aneurysm size, or comorbidities between the 
      trans- and retroperitoneal groups with suprarenal cross-clamping. The 30-day 
      mortality was 2/38 (5%) and occurred only in the transperitoneal group. The 
      transperitoneal approach was associated with significantly greater blood loss and 
      longer suprarenal cross-clamp times (2,400 vs. 1,800 mL and 38.0 vs. 29.5 min; p = 
      0.03), but there were no significant differences in 30-day postoperative 
      complications. In our 7 years' experience, there has been a gradual increase in the 
      utilization of EVAR for infrarenal AAAs. At the same time, more infrarenal AAAs with 
      hostile aortic necks requiring suprarenal aortic cross-clamping were encountered. In 
      such instances, the retroperitoneal approach is safer, with less perioperative blood 
      loss and shorter suprarenal cross-clamp time. This is likely attributed to better 
      exposure of the suprarenal abdominal aorta, allowing a more secure proximal 
      anastomosis.

TI  - The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium concentration 
      among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 136
LID - 10.1186/s12882-015-0139-9 [doi]
LID - 136
AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is 
      inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case 
      reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the 
      hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We 
      hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently 
      reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum 
      Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study 
      the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels. METHODS: Using a single-center 
      cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum 
      Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive 
      serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests 
      was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined 
      in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of 
      ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration. RESULTS: 55 % of patients 
      were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a 
      dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 
      0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 
      vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate 
      Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more 
      PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 
      0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time 
      on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067). CONCLUSION: Among HD 
      patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further 
      research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among 
      PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification independently predicts 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to 
      evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification 
      (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal 
      transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large 
      multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry. METHODS: 
      Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study 
      of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 
      27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were 
      derived. RESULTS: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. 
      Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The 
      overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and 
      ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After 
      adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood 
      pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total 
      of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between 
      average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 
      32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and 
      blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, 
      systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were 
      associated with TAC progression. CONCLUSIONS: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors 
      were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence 
      and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for 
      coronary calcification.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a strong prognostic marker of mortality in hemodialysis 
      patients and has been associated with bone metabolism disorders in this population. 
      In earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular calcification also has 
      been documented. This study evaluated the association between coronary artery 
      calcification (CAC) and bone histomorphometric parameters in CKD predialysis 
      patients assessed by multislice coronary tomography and by undecalcified bone 
      biopsy. CAC was detected in 33 (66%) patients, and their median calcium score was 
      89.7 (0.4-2299.3 AU). The most frequent bone histologic alterations observed 
      included low trabecular bone volume, increased eroded and osteoclast surfaces, and 
      low bone-formation rate (BFR/BS). Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted 
      for age, sex, and diabetes, showed that BFR/BS was independently associated with the 
      presence of coronary calcification [p = .009; odd ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 0.036-0.619]. This study showed a high prevalence of CAC in 
      asymptomatic predialysis CKD patients. Also, there was an independent association of 
      low bone formation and CAC in this population. In conclusion, our results provide 
      evidence that low bone-formation rate constitutes another nontraditional risk factor 
      for cardiovascular disease in CKD patients.

      Framingham Heart Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether magnesium intake is 
      associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic 
      calcification (AAC). BACKGROUND: Animal and cell studies suggest that magnesium may 
      prevent calcification within atherosclerotic plaques underlying cardiovascular 
      disease. Little is known about the association of magnesium intake and 
      atherosclerotic calcification in humans. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional 
      associations of self-reported total (dietary and supplemental) magnesium intake 
      estimated by food frequency questionnaire with CAC and AAC in participants of the 
      Framingham Heart Study who were free of cardiovascular disease and underwent 
      Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the heart and abdomen (n = 2,695; age: 
      53 ± 11 years), using multivariate-adjusted Tobit regression. CAC and AAC were 
      quantified using modified Agatston scores (AS). Models were adjusted for age, sex, 
      body mass index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, 
      total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, use of hormone replacement 
      therapy (women only), menopausal status (women only), treatment for hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension, cardiovascular disease prevention, or diabetes, as well as 
      self-reported intake of calcium, vitamins D and K, saturated fat, fiber, alcohol, 
      and energy. Secondary analyses included logistic regressions of CAC and AAC outcomes 
      as cut-points (AS >0 and AS ≥90th percentile for age and sex), as well as 
      sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, a 50-mg/day increment in 
      self-reported total magnesium intake was associated with 22% lower CAC (p < 0.001) 
      and 12% lower AAC (p = 0.07). Consistent with these observations, the odds of having 
      any CAC were 58% lower (p trend: <0.001) and any AAC were 34% lower (p trend: 0.01), 
      in those with the highest compared to those with the lowest magnesium intake. 
      Stronger inverse associations were observed in women than in men. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      community-dwelling participants free of cardiovascular disease, self-reported 
      magnesium intake was inversely associated with arterial calcification, which may 
      play a contributing role in magnesium's protective associations in stroke and fatal 
      coronary heart disease.

TI  - Advanced coronary and carotid arteriopathy in young adults with childhood-onset 
      chronic renal failure.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is excessive in young adults with end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). The factors contributing to ESRD-related vascular disease are 
      incompletely understood. Young adults with childhood-onset chronic renal failure 
      (CRF) are uniquely suited for risk factor assessment because of their long-term 
      exposure at an age when vascular pathology in the general population is still 
      minimal. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used novel noninvasive technologies to screen for 
      coronary and carotid artery disease in 39 patients with ESRD aged 19 to 39 years 
      with childhood-onset CRF presently treated by dialysis or renal transplantation. 
      Coronary artery calcification burden was assessed by CT scan with ECG gating and the 
      intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries by high-resolution ultrasound. 
      Coronary artery calcifications were present in 92% of patients; calcium scores 
      exceeded the 95th age- and sex-specific percentiles >10-fold on average. Carotid IMT 
      was significantly increased compared with matched control subjects. Both coronary 
      calcium scores and IMT were associated with cumulative dialysis and ESRD time and 
      the cumulative serum calcium-phosphate product. Coronary calcium scores were 
      strongly correlated with C-reactive protein and Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositivity, 
      time-averaged mean serum parathyroid hormone, and plasma homocysteine. C-reactive 
      protein and parathyroid hormone independently predicted coronary calcium 
      accumulation. Smoking, obesity, and HbA1c were correlated with IMT in the control 
      subjects but not in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with childhood-onset CRF 
      have a high prevalence of arteriopathy associated with indicators of 
      microinflammation, hyperparathyroidism, calcium-phosphate overload, and 
      hyperhomocysteinemia but not traditional atherogenic risk factors. These risk 
      factors persist even after successful renal transplantation.

TI  - Association among serum fetuin-A level, coronary artery calcification, and bone 
      mineral densitometry in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 844-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00814.x [doi]
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of 
      arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic 
      mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of 
      atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification 
      inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry 
      parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a 
      cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 
      age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in 
      maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, 
      hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by 
      electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD 
      parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. 
      CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in 
      patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, 
      neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A 
      concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less 
      than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of 
      plaques in coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A 
      levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum 
      fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter 
      of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an 
      association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone 
      mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, 
      the results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design 
      of the study.

TI  - Carotid atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure-the central role of increased 
      plaque burden.
PG  - 295-302
AB  - Studies on carotid artery atherosclerosis have been performed in order to understand 
      the high risk for cardiovascular disease in chronic renal failure (CRF). The purpose 
      of this study was to evaluate the extent and nature of carotid artery 
      atherosclerosis in patients with CRF. Of the 135 patients with CRF (52 +/- 11 
      years), 58 had moderate to severe predialysis CRF (PR), 36 were on dialysis 
      treatment (DI), and 41 were renal transplant recipients (TR). In addition, 58 
      control subjects (CO) were examined. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness 
      (IMT), plaque prevalence, plaque score, and stiffness index beta were determined. 
      Furthermore, plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were 
      classified. Plaque prevalence (PR 64%, DI 61%, TR 51%, CO 28%; P < 0.001) and plaque 
      score (PR 3.3 +/- 4.3, DI 3.0 +/- 3.4, TR 2.5 +/- 3.2, CO 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm; P < 0.001) 
      were significantly greater in the CRF patient groups compared to the controls, 
      whereas no difference in IMT was noted between the study groups. The prevalences of 
      plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were higher among the CRF 
      patient groups. In addition, the stiffness index beta was higher in the CRF patient 
      groups. The present study shows that the characteristic alterations of the carotid 
      arteries in CRF include increased plaque burden, calcification and increased 
      arterial stiffness.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, not 
      with uremic vasculopathy in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 135-41
LID - 10.5414/CN108716 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on peritoneal 
      dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role 
      of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess 
      the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular 
      calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients. METHODS: Left 
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D echocardiography. Intact FGF23 
      blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, 
      USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial 
      dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial 
      stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). 
      Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragão score. RESULTS: In 
      unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 
      0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), 
      dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was 
      negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = 
      -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted 
      analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (β = 
      0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, 
      gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic 
      blood pressure. There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in 
      multivariable- adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FGF23 is 
      associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or 
      vascular calcification in PD patients.

TI  - Risk factors for progression of aortic arch calcification in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 460-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2011.00571.x [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an 
      important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch 
      calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using plain 
      chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC 
      progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 
      59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography 
      before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then divided 
      the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of AoAC progression. 
      We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical profiles in the two groups. 
      Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age, 58.6 ± 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients 
      (41.3%) had AoAC before initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 ± 20.4%. The 
      mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 ± 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had 
      progressive AoAC. Age >65 years (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes 
      (p = 0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC 
      progression. No significant association was found between AoAC progression and the 
      baseline clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis 
      modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the presence 
      of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC progression 
      in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the presence of AoAC 
      before initial dialysis were significantly related to the progression of AoAC in 
      these patients. The results suggest that patients should be carefully managed from 
      the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular 
      morbidity.

TI  - Myringosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure: comparative analysis with a 
      control group.
PG  - 494-502
AB  - Myringosclerosis is a scar of the tympanic membrane lamina propria, resulting from 
      trauma or inflammation, characterized by proliferation of collagen, hyalinization, 
      calcium and phosphate deposits and cartilaginous or osseous metaplasia of the middle 
      ear mucosa, a sequence that is similar to that taking place in other types of 
      pathologic calcification, common in chronic renal failure (CRF). AIM: To verify the 
      influence of chronic renal failure on the prevalence of myringosclerosis. METHOD: 
      The otoscopic examination was done in 341 chronic renal failure patients and in 356 
      normal control individuals. The frequency of positive otoscopies was compared 
      between the two groups, based on individual variables and those pertaining to CRF. 
      RESULTS: 11.7% of the patients had a positive otoscopy in the CRF group, compared to 
      5.1% in the control group. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of 
      myringosclerosis according to gender, ethnic group, time of dialysis or serum 
      minerals. The groups had a wide age range. CONCLUSION: Although the findings of this 
      study suggest a higher occurrence of myringosclerosis in patients with renal 
      disease, they do not provide a basis for stating that there is any relation between 
      renal failure and tympanic alterations.

TI  - Impact of sevelamer hydrochloride on serum magnesium concentrations in hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 184-190
LID - 10.1684/mrh.2016.0410 [doi]
AB  - Serum Mg levels are elevated in patients with renal insufficiency: harmful effects 
      of hypomagnesemia have been reported in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). In 
      this cross-sectional study, which included 86 HD patients (male : female = 56:30, 
      age 68 ± 12 years), we examined the clinical factors associated with serum Mg 
      levels, with a focus on sevelamer, a phosphate binder widely used to control the 
      hyperphosphatemia of HD patients. The mean serum Mg concentration among our patients 
      was 2.48 ± 0.37 mg/dL (1.02 ± 0.15 mmol/L). Sevelamer was administered to 67 
      patients (77.9%) at a mean dose of 1.98 ± 1.64 g/day. Sex, diabetes mellitus, 
      cardiovascular disease, anuria, and drugs other than sevelamer were not associated 
      with serum Mg levels. HD duration, serum calcium, albumin, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), creatinine generation rate, 
      and sevelamer dose correlated positively with serum Mg levels, whereas a negative 
      correlation was observed for age and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A stepwise 
      multiple regression analysis revealed that age, nPCR, and the dose of sevelamer were 
      independently associated with serum Mg levels. Sevelamer and Mg have been reported 
      to exhibit similar effects, such as an anti-inflammatory effect, inhibition of 
      cardiovascular calcification, and decreased mortality. Therefore, the pleiotropic 
      effects of sevelamer may be partly attributable to the increase in serum Mg levels 
      caused by the drug itself.

      lipid profiles and coronary artery calcification score in 219 Japanese hemodialysis 
      (HD) patients. METHODS: Genotyping of these polymorphisms was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers assay. RESULTS: The A 
      allele frequency of rs7895833 and G allele frequency of rs7069102 were significantly 
      lower in HD patients (0.228 and 0.131, respectively) than those in 803 control 
      subjects (general population) (0.289 and 0.181, respectively) (P = .010 and P = 
      .012, respectively). However, the allele frequency of rs2273773 was not 
      significantly different from that in the control subjects. Multivariate analysis 
      adjusted for age and duration on HD demonstrated that the serum levels of total and 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly high in G allele carriers of 
      rs7069102 compared with CC genotype in male HD patients. Coronary artery 
      calcification score was significantly high in C allele carriers of rs2273773 in all 
      and male HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT 1 polymorphisms, rs7069102 and rs2273773, 
      are associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism and coronary artery 
      calcification, respectively, in Japanese HD patients, especially in males.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High serum phosphorus and the calcium-phosphorus product concentration 
      has been associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular events in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the 
      relationship between calcium-phosphorus product concentration and the presence of 
      coronary artery calcification in subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: 
      We reviewed the medical records of 2056 general subjects with a mean age of 55.1 ± 
      9.9 years and a glomerular filtration rate of 88.9 ± 16.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The 
      enrolled subjects consisted of 384 (18.7%) subjects with MetS and 1672 (81.3%) 
      subjects without MetS. The severity of coronary artery calcification was assessed by 
      the coronary artery calcification score (CACS) using multi-detector computed 
      tomography (MDCT). RESULTS: The CACS correlated with calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration in subjects with MetS (r = 0.184, P < 0.01). The odds ratio of 
      calcium-phosphorus product concentration having CACS >50 was 1.053 in subjects with 
      MetS (P < 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, 
      calcium-phosphorus product concentrations had a positive correlation with CACS in 
      subjects with MetS. In single regression analysis, calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration as independent variable was the significant predictor of CACS in 
      subjects with MetS. Using a multivariate analysis, calcium-phosphorus product 
      concentration remained a significant factor associated with CACS in subjects with 
      MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-phosphorus product concentration was weakly associated 
      with CACS and an independent factor predicting for CACS by MDCT in subjects with 
      MetS. These results suggest that calcium-phosphorus product concentration might be 
      considered as a risk factor of coronary artery disease in subjects with MetS.

TI  - Carotid intima media thickness and aortic calcification index closely relate to 
      cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 48-51; discussion 51-2
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2007.01925.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Atherosclerosis can be evaluated by carotid intima media thickness (IMT), the 
      aortic calcification index (ACI), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). We investigated 
      which test was most closely related to cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders (CCVD) 
      in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Maximum IMT (max-IMT), ACI, and PWV were examined 
      in 110 hemodialysis patients, using carotid ultrasonography, abdominal CT and a 
      blood pressure pulse wave instrument, respectively. Blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
      serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, total 
      protein, albumin, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha were measured. The patients were divided into two groups; with and 
      without CCVD and the degree of atherosclerosis was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: 
      Compared to the CCVD (-) group, the CCVD (+) group showed significantly higher 
      percentages of males and diabetic patients, higher levels of HbA1c (5.14 vs 4.83%) 
      and hs-CRP (0.320 vs 0.167 mg/dL), an older age group (64.5 vs 57.5 years), a 
      greater max-IMT (2.05 vs 1.19 mm), and a higher ACI (71.8 vs 41.0%); and 
      significantly lower diastolic blood pressure (82.8 vs 89.2 mmHg). Multiple logistic 
      regression analysis showed that the factors influencing the development of CCVD were 
      age (odds ratio: 1.092), ACI (odds ratio: 1.025), and max-IMT (odds ratio: 2.006). 
      However, PWV did not significantly relate to CCVD. CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis 
      patients, the ACI and max-IMT were significantly associated with CCVD, but the 
      association of PWV was weak. A prospective cohort study is warranted to determine 
      the risk factors for CCVD in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and progression of aortic arch 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the 
      progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF)-23. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD 
      patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a 
      score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by 
      subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second 
      assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors 
      (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis duration in regressors 
      (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors (19.5±7.0 years) and 
      progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors 
      (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in non-progressors 
      (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple 
      regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum 
      levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (β 
      value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of 
      ΔAoACS. CONCLUSION: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are 
      associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may 
      enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Case-control study of calcification of the hepatic artery in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients: comparison with the abdominal aorta and splenic artery.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies of the hepatic artery are scarce. We have observed that 
      hepatic artery calcification is very uncommon in patients with hyperparathyroidism 
      that expedites calcification. METHODS: Plain abdominal CT was studied in 221 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis. Control consisted of 442 sex- and age-matched 
      patients with other diseases. Calcification was graded as a percentage of the entire 
      wall circumference for the aorta, and as a percentage of the entire length of the 
      hepatic and splenic arteries from the celiac trunk to the hilum of each organ. 
      RESULTS: Aortic calcification was seen in 79.2% of male dialysis patients, 22.1% of 
      controls, 74.1% of female dialysis patients and 17.3% of controls (P < 0.0001). 
      Hepatic artery calcification was seen in only 13 dialysis patients. The degree of 
      calcification of the abdominal aorta was correlated with the length of hemodialysis 
      period (P = 0.008), but not with serum calcium, serum phosphate or their product. 
      Although serum parathormone levels were not correlated with calcification, seven of 
      eight dialysis patients with hepatic artery calcification had very high parathormone 
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: The hepatic artery is far less frequently calcified than are 
      the abdominal aorta and splenic artery. This may be a teleologic phenomenon of the 
      liver.

TI  - Risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications in non-diabetic Caucasian 
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 161-8
LID - 10.1159/000221064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dialysis patients display an increased mortality which is 
      associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Diabetes mellitus and ethnicity are 
      known factors that affect the extent of cardiovascular calcifications. However, most 
      studies have investigated mixed cohorts with diabetics and/or mixed ethnicity. 
      METHODS: Cardiovascular calcifications were assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian 
      haemodialysis patients by the semiquantitative Adragao calcification score (X-ray 
      pelvis and hands) and a novel composite calcification score encompassing the Adragao 
      score as well as calcifications detected by X-ray of the fistula arm, 
      echocardiography of heart valves and carotid ultrasound. RESULTS: Using multivariate 
      analysis, age, male gender, dialysis vintage, lower Kt/V, calcium-phosphate product, 
      smoking and high-sensitivity CRP were independent risk factors for cardiovascular 
      calcifications as assessed by the Adragao or the composite score. Pulse wave 
      velocity was independently related to both calcification scores. Body mass index, 
      cholesterol, triglycerides, iPTH and serum levels of fetuin-A and uncarboxylated 
      matrix Gla protein were not associated with cardiovascular calcifications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients, age, 
      male gender, dialysis vintage, smoking, calcium-phosphate product, high-sensitivity 
      CRP and lower Kt/V were independent risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications. 
      Whether lowering the calcium-phosphate product and increasing dialysis efficiency 
      can reduce cardiovascular calcifications in dialysis patients remains to be 
      determined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proteinuria is a marker of graft damage and is closely associated with a 
      higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant 
      recipients (KTRs). Arterial stiffness is a well-known predictor of vascular 
      calcification and systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate 
      the association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to determine 
      whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular disease in our KTR 
      population. METHODS: Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 ± 11 years, with 45.9 ± 9.6 
      months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in the 3 to 5 years 
      of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All patients were evaluated for 
      their standard clinical (age, sex, and duration of hemodialysis) parameters. 
      High-grade proteinuria was defined as proteinuria >500 mg/day in the 24-hour urine 
      collection. All patients were evaluated by means of pulse-wave velocity (PWV) 
      measurement at the initiation of the study. RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 
      groups: group 1 (high-grade proteinuria) patients with ≥500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and 
      group 2 (low-grade proteinuria) patients with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60). High-grade 
      proteinuria was correlated with higher PWV measurements and lower estimated 
      glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria appears to precede the elevation of serum 
      creatinine and thus may be a useful marker of renal injury and may also be a 
      contributing factor on deterioration of the graft. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade (>500 
      mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly associated with poor graft survival and 
      increased risk of cardiovascular events. In our study, we proved the significant 
      difference between high-grade and low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 
      mg/day as the threshold of proteinuria in KTR population.

TI  - Prevalence of vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality in 
      warfarin treated hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 248-58
AB  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization and 
      the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla protein 
      MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 
      387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. 
      Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared 
      with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and 
      mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L 
      vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients 
      had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 
      48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), 
      with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In 
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with 
      increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, 
      p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and 
      total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In 
      univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of 
      all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those 
      untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the 
      significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In 
      hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit 
      ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and 
      increased mortality.

PG  - 214-21

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was 
      to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous fistula 
      AVF (feeding artery and/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral 
      computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). PATIENTS 
      AND METHOD: Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%, mean duration 
      65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were evaluated by CT 
      in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F: 28.9%; mean time on HD 
      53.1 +/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF explorations were 
      performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual machine, GE 
      Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was quantified by CT using the 
      following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications, grade II isolated 
      calcifications (<10 groups of calcification), grade III moderate calcifications 
      (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (>20 groups of 
      calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid 
      hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The same week of CT scanning, 
      we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA 
      (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using 
      the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the 
      same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine, 
      Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded 
      simultaneous with QA. RESULTS: Most pts not showed AVF calcification by CT scan 
      (grade I: 27/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts (18/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF 
      calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III 8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial 
      AVF showed higher mean QA compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus 
      1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +/- 16.2 mmHg) 
      and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between 
      both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any 
      calcification on CT scanning (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 
      63.1 versus 24.6 +/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 
      +/- 61.2 months) and similar QA (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9 ml/min) 
      compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, 
      respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), 
      prevalence of brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were 
      found when comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were 
      obtained when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II: 
      73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and 
      without (grade I) AVF calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The prevalence of AVF 
      calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time on 
      HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis and 
      suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.

LID - e0172407
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis/calcific uremic arteriolopathy affects mainly end-stage 
      kidney disease patients but is also associated with malignant disorders such as 
      myeloma, melanoma and breast cancer. Genetic risk factors of calciphylaxis have 
      never been studied before. METHODS: We investigated 10 target genes using a tagging 
      SNP approach: the genes encoding CD73/ ecto-5'-nucleotidase (purinergic pathway), 
      Matrix Gla protein, Fetuin A, Bone Gla protein, VKORC1 (all related to intrinsic 
      calcification inhibition), calcium-sensing receptor, FGF23, Klotho, vitamin D 
      receptor, stanniocalcin 1 (all related to CKD-MBD). 144 dialysis patients from the 
      German calciphylaxis registry were compared with 370 dialysis patients without 
      history of CUA. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX Gold MassARRAY(Sequenom, San 
      Diego, USA), KASP genotyping chemistry (LGC, Teddington, Middlesex, UK) or 
      sequencing. Statistical analysis comprised logistic regression analysis with 
      adjustment for age and sex. RESULTS: 165 SNPs were finally analyzed and 6 SNPs were 
      associated with higher probability for calciphylaxis (OR>1) in our cohort. Nine SNPs 
      of three genes (CD73, FGF23 and Vitamin D receptor) reached nominal significance (p< 
      0.05), but did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple 
      testing. Of the CD73 gene, rs4431401 (OR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.08-2.17, p = 0.023) and 
      rs9444348 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.97, p = 0.008) were associated with a higher 
      probability for CUA. Of the FGF23 and VDR genes, rs7310492, rs11063118, rs13312747 
      and rs17882106 were associated with a higher probability for CUA. CONCLUSION: 
      Polymorphisms in the genes encoding CD73, vitamin D receptor and FGF23 may play a 
      role in calciphylaxis development. Although our study is the largest genetic study 
      on calciphylaxis, it is limited by the low sample sizes. It therefore requires 
      replication in other cohorts if available.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and associated factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 395-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and 
      is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular 
      calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the frequency of, 
      and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in 
      a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the 
      recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative 
      guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a 
      sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level 
      (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' 
      characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 
      and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; 
      and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% 
      and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, 
      and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 
      6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant 
      treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as 
      a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 
      66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 
      21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a 
      higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < 
      .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage 
      levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, 
      normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip 
      bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were 
      significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol 
      deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated 
      factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher 
      intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy 
      of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D 
      supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need 
      for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and 
      the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

TI  - Serum magnesium is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification in the 
      Genetics of Atherosclerotic Disease (GEA) study.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s12937-016-0143-3 [doi]
LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum magnesium is inversely associated to coronary artery calcification 
      (CAC) in patients with chronic kidney disease. There is little information on this 
      association in a general healthy population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to 
      examine the cross-sectional association of serum magnesium levels with CAC. METHODS: 
      We included 1276 Mexican-mestizo subjects (50 % women), aged 30-75 years, free of 
      symptomatic cardiovascular disease. CAC was quantified by multidetector computed 
      tomography using the method described by Agatston. Cross-sectional associations of 
      serum magnesium with cardiometabolic factors and subclinical atherosclerosis defined 
      as a CAC score > 0, were examined in logistic regression models adjusted for age, 
      sex, education, smoking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, physical 
      activity, elevated abdominal visceral tissue, fasting insulin and glucose, alcohol 
      consumption, menopausal status (women only), low (LDL-C) and high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, diuretic use, type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (DM2), and family history of DM2. RESULTS: After full adjustment, subjects 
      in the highest quartile of serum magnesium had 48 % lower odds of hypertension (p = 
      0.028), 69 % lower odds of DM2 (p = 0.003), and 42 % lower odds of CAC score > 0 (p 
      = 0.016) compared to those with the lowest serum magnesium. The analyses also showed 
      that a 0.17 mg/dL (1SD) increment in serum magnesium was independently associated 
      with 16 % lower CAC (OR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.724-0.986). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 
      Mexican-mestizo subjects, low serum magnesium was independently associated to higher 
      prevalence not only of hypertension and DM2, but also to coronary artery 
      calcification, which is a marker of atherosclerosis and a predictor of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Cardiac vascular calcification and QT interval in ESRD patients: is there a link?
PG  - 451-9
AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation 
      between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
      studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 +/- 
      27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 
      years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good 
      mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 
      4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 
      mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than 
      CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in 
      both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification 
      than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher 
      or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), 
      frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), 
      parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). 
      The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores 
      (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients 
      with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in 
      both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, 
      age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium 
      x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants 
      of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac 
      calcification in uraemic patients.

AB  - Hypertension is very common in dialysis patients. Disorders of mineral metabolism 
      have been linked to vascular calcification and hypertension in dialysis. Fifty-four 
      hemodialysis patients were included in a cross-sectional study in a dialysis unit 
      during a 6-month period. Linear regression analysis was done between averages of 
      calcium and phosphorus (ca x ph) product and blood pressures (BPs). Ca x ph was 
      significantly associated with systolic BP predialysis (P=.03, R=0.28), diastolic BP 
      predialysis (P=.001, R=0.44), predialysis mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P=.002, 
      R=0.4), and diastolic BP postdialysis (P=.03, R=0.26). No relationship was found 
      with pulse pressures. Multilinear regression analysis was then done between ca x ph 
      product and BPs adjusting for age, sex, hemoglobin, diabetes, albumin, parathyroid 
      hormone, ultrafiltration volume, and average BP medications per patient. There was a 
      strong positive association with predialysis systolic BP (P=.003, R(2)=0.49), 
      predialysis MAP (P=.001, R(2)=0.51), and postdialysis MAP (P=.02, R(2)=0.65). No 
      associations with pulse pressures were detected. The study findings suggest that ca 
      x ph product is significantly associated with dialysis MAP and not pulse pressure. 
      This is likely secondary to the stronger relationship with diastolic BP than with 
      systolic BP. Prospective studies looking into the associated hemodynamic parameters 
      related to arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction along with measures for 
      calcifications would be very beneficial.

TI  - The effect of immunosuppressive treatment on arterial stiffness and matrix Gla 
      protein levels in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 491-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In this 
      study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian 
      Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal transplant 
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or 
      mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial 
      stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, 
      Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein (MGP) 
      concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). 
      RESULTS: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. Mean 
      age was 37.9 ± 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were female. Age, gender, graft 
      functions and follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index was 
      15.2 ± 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 ± 14.0% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There was no 
      difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between groups. Arterial 
      stiffness was positively correlated with age, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria. MGP levels were higher in the mTORi 
      group but were not predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSION: 
      Rather than specific immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional risk factors, 
      blood pressure and proteinuria are the most important predictors for arterial 
      stiffness in renal transplant patients.

TI  - Association between very low PTH levels and poor survival rates in haemodialysis 
      patients: results from the French ARNOS cohort.
PG  - c211-6
LID - 10.1159/000321642 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated with 
      an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and mortality in 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency, the 
      associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent 
      HD patients. METHODS: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the 
      French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the 
      Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 
      1) and ≥ 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis was 
      performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded. 
      RESULTS: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 
      (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels 
      (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 
      1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, 
      p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 
      0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 
      0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds 
      ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and 
      serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any 
      PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet 
      (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥ 1.5 mmol/l (94%)). CONCLUSION: In this 
      observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and 
      was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be 
      responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic 
      bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing 
      vascular calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using 
      fewer PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor 
      prognosis.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in 
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) 
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly 
      recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels 
      of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study 
      investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with 
      all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc 
      survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 
      2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters 
      of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum 
      sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: 
      Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] 
      pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older 
      age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a 
      median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels 
      were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard 
      ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum 
      sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When 
      bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are 
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the 
      causal pathway.

TI  - The relationship between the Spine Deformity Index, biochemical parameters of bone 
      metabolism and vascular calcifications: results from the Epidemiological VERtebral 
      FRACtures iTalian Study (EVERFRACT) in dialysis patients.
PG  - 1595-603
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2014-0194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a measure of vertebral fractures 
      (VFs), providing information on both their number and severity. METHODS: We 
      evaluated the relationships between SDI and clinical, biochemical and arterial 
      calcification parameters in 387 hemodialysis (HD) patients. VFs, assessed by 
      quantitative vertebral morphometry, and vascular calcifications were identified in 
      the same lateral spinal X-ray. To improve the detection of fracture severity, we 
      created a corrected SDI (c-SDI), by dividing SDI for the number of VFs. We assessed 
      routine biochemistry, bone-Gla-protein (BGP), undercaboxylated BGP (ucBGP), and 
      matrix-Gla-protein (MGP). RESULTS: VFs prevalence was 55.3%. HD patients with a SDI 
      >1 were more frequently males (p<0.05), and had lower BGP (p<0.01). Patients with a 
      c-SDI >1 had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.05) and lower ucBGP (p<0.05) and MGP 
      (p<0.05). Calcifications of the abdominal aorta (AAoC) were more frequent in 
      patients with SDI >1 (p<0.05) and with c-SDI >1 (p<0.05). Multivariate logistic 
      regression showed that male sex (OR 1.86, CI 1.20-2.91), age (OR 1.03, CI 1.01-1.05) 
      and albumin ≥3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, CI 0.31-0.93) were predictors of a SDI >1. Age (OR 
      1.05, CI 1.03-1.07), LDL-cholesterol (OR 1.74, CI 1.04-2.92) and ucBGP (OR 0.35, CI 
      0.18-0.70) were associated with c-SDI >1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the severity 
      of VFs was associated with age, atherogenic factors and bone metabolism markers.

TI  - Mortality effect of coronary calcification and phosphate binder choice in incident 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 438-41
AB  - The risk of death in hemodialysis patients treated with calcium-containing phosphate 
      binders or sevelamer is not known. We assessed all-cause mortality in 127 patients 
      new to hemodialysis assigned to calcium-containing binders or sevelamer after a 
      median follow-up of 44 months from randomization. This was a predetermined secondary 
      end point of a randomized clinical trial designed to assess progression of coronary 
      artery calcium (CAC) scores in the two treatment arms. Thirty-four deaths occurred 
      during the follow-up period: 23 in subjects randomized to calcium-containing 
      phosphate binders and 11 in subjects randomized to sevelamer. Baseline CAC score was 
      a significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age, race, gender, and 
      diabetes with increased mortality proportional to baseline score (P=0.002). 
      Mortality was borderline significantly lower in subjects randomized to sevelamer 
      (5.3/100 patient years, confidence interval (CI) (2.2-8.5) compared to those 
      randomized to calcium-containing binders (10.6/100 patient years, CI 6.3-14.9) 
      (P=0.05). The greater risk of death for patients treated with calcium-containing 
      phosphate binders persisted after full multivariable adjustment (P=0.016, hazard 
      ratio 3.1, CI 1.23-7.61). In subjects new to hemodialysis baseline CAC score was a 
      significant predictor of all-cause mortality. Treatment with sevelamer was 
      associated with a significant survival benefit as compared to the use of 
      calcium-containing phosphate binders.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification as an important predictor for all-cause mortality and 
      cardiovascular mortality in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients: a prospective 
      study.
PG  - 159-68
AB  - Calcification complications are frequent among long-term dialysis patients. However, 
      the prognostic implication of cardiac valve calcification in this population is not 
      known. This study aimed to determine if cardiac valve calcification predicts 
      mortality in long-term dialysis patients. Baseline echocardiography was performed in 
      192 patients (mean +/- SD age, 55 +/- 12 yr) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (mean +/- SD duration of dialysis, 39 +/- 31 mo) to screen for 
      calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, or both. Valvular calcification was 
      present in 62 patients. During the mean follow-up of 17.9 mo (range, 0.6 to 33.9 
      mo), 46 deaths (50% of cardiovascular causes) were observed. Overall 1-yr survival 
      was 70% and 93% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001, 
      log-rank test). Cardiovascular mortality was 22% and 3% for patients with and 
      without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis 
      showed that cardiac valve calcification was predictive of an increased all-cause 
      mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.76; P = 0.005) and 
      cardiovascular death (HR 5.39; 95% CI, 2.16 to 13.48; P = 0.0003) independent of 
      age, male gender, dialysis duration, C-reactive protein, diabetes, and 
      atherosclerotic vascular disease. Eighty-nine percent of patients with both valvular 
      calcification and atherosclerotic vascular disease, 23% of patients with valvular 
      calcification only, 21% of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 
      13% of patients with neither complication died at 1-yr (P < 0.0005). The 
      cardiovascular death rate was 85% for patients with both complications, 13% for 
      patients with valvular calcification only, 14% for patients with atherosclerotic 
      vascular disease only, and 5% for those with neither complication (P < 0.0005). The 
      number of calcified valves was associated with all-cause mortality (P < 0.0005) and 
      cardiovascular death (P < 0.0005). One-year all-cause mortality was 57% for patients 
      with both aortic and mitral valves calcified, 40% for those with either valve 
      calcified, and 15% for those with neither valve calcified. In conclusion, cardiac 
      valve calcification is a powerful predictor for mortality and cardiovascular deaths 
      in long-term dialysis patients. Valvular calcification by itself has similar 
      prognostic importance as the presence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Its 
      coexistence with other atherosclerotic complications indicates more severe disease 
      and has the worst outcome.

TI  - Relationship between serum pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin and 
      atherosclerotic parameters in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 31-5
LID - 10.1159/000148648 [doi]
AB  - Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)/visfatin is produced by adipose tissue, 
      skeletal muscle, bone marrow, the liver and lymphocytes. Although serum 
      PBEF/visfatin is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and its level is 
      elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, it remains unclear whether 
      increased PBEF/visfatin is associated with atherosclerotic parameters in 
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we measured serum PBEF/visfatin in 68 
      chronic HD patients (age 66 +/- 14 years, time on HD 76 +/- 76 months, 41 males, 27 
      females) and examined the association of serum PBEF/visfatin with serum asymmetric 
      dimethylarginine, arteriosclerotic parameters such as pulse wave velocity, ankle 
      brachial pressure index and the percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification in a 
      cross-sectional fashion. Serum PBEF/visfatin was significantly correlated with time 
      on HD (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), but not with age, gender and diabetes. There was no 
      association between PBEF/visfatin and body mass index, abdominal visceral and 
      subcutaneous fat mass area, and total adiponectin. Serum PBEF/visfatin was 
      significantly positively correlated with log-transformed highly sensitive C-reactive 
      protein (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) but negatively with serum albumin (r = -0.33, p < 
      0.01). In contrast, there was no association between serum PBEF/visfatin and 
      asymmetric dimethylarginine, aortic pulse wave velocity, brachial ankle pressure 
      index and percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification. It follows from these 
      findings that serum PBEF/visfatin may reflect the inflammatory status rather than 
      atherosclerotic changes in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Modeling the implications of changes in vascular calcification in patients on 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 1532-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of 
      coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based 
      phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular 
      events, risk equations are needed. METHODS: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis 
      treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to 
      study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 
      years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified 
      using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography 
      (EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all 
      patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional 
      hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of 
      calcification, controlling for other characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion 
      was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered 
      an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic 
      blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of 
      cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a 
      calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a 
      score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000. CONCLUSION: In the absence 
      of long-term follow-up studies, these equations permit quantification of the 
      expected long-term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders 
      on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these 
      equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased incidence of 
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and posttransplant diabetes 
      mellitus that promote the development of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The 
      aim of the current study was to elucidate the extent of CAC and its risk factors 
      among KT patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the 
      severity of CAC in our KT patients. Multidetector computed tomography was performed 
      to assess the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were further stratified 
      according to the CACS as: group 1: 0-10, group 2: 11-100, group 3: 101-300, group 4: 
      301-1000, and group 5: >1000. Clinical as well as demographic data were compared 
      among groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors that 
      were associated with CAC. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were enrolled in the 
      study. The mean age was 53.5 ± 11.8 years and duration of follow-up post-KT was 11.2 
      ± 5.9 years. The distribution of CACS in groups 1 through 5 was: 41.4%, 20.2%, 
      11.1%, 15.2%, and 12.1%, respectively. A significantly higher CACS was found in 
      males, patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus, older current age, older age 
      at KT, hypertension, higher body weight, higher fasting plasma sugar level and lower 
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Twenty-nine (29.3%) patients fulfilled 
      criteria for metabolic syndrome (MS). The CACS was significantly higher in patients 
      with MS than in those without MS. An incremental CACS was found to be correlated 
      with increasing number of MS components (P = .003). Multivariate linear regression 
      revealed that female gender, current age, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were 
      associated with CAC. CONCLUSION: KT was associated with high CACS in a significant 
      proportion of patients with long-term follow-up. Several risk factors were 
      identified. Some of them were potentially treatable and should be taken into 
      consideration in the management of KT recipients.

TI  - Survival following parathyroidectomy among United States dialysis patients.
PG  - 2010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among persons 
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone disease, 
      vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can 
      dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the 
      relationship between PTX and survival is not known. METHODS: We conducted an 
      observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United States Renal 
      Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first PTX while on 
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, 
      cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis 
      modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed 
      from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The 30-day 
      postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. Long-term relative risks of 
      death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those 
      of matched control patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 
      groups crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 
      51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, 
      mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to 
      attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients with 
      end-stage renal disease.

TI  - General weakness as an indication for parathyroid surgery in patients with secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 1108-11
AB  - HYPOTHESES: There are factors that affect patients with general weakness owing to 
      secondary hyperparathyroidism and as reported by results noted after 
      parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. DESIGN: Case series and consecutive 
      samples. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: From July 1996 to June 1998, 56 
      patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism underwent total parathyroidectomy and 
      autotransplantation. Their ages were 45 +/- 13 years (mean +/- SD) and preoperative 
      duration of dialysis was 75 +/- 37 months. Prior to surgery the patients were 
      divided into 2 groups: group A comprised 2 men and 19 women who had some general 
      weakness; and group B, 15 men and 20 women who reported no general weakness. The 
      etiologies of renal failure, such as diabetic nephropathy (n = 3) or hypertensive 
      nephropathy (n = 3), were found only in group A patients. INTERVENTIONS: Serum 
      levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone 
      (intact) were checked preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, and 3 months after surgery. 
      Extension force of the quadriceps femoris muscle was measured at 60 degrees of right 
      knee flexion preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. The extension force was 
      expressed as newtons (N) in 2 different quantities: peak force and average force. 
      The degree of general weakness was classified into 4 groups: 0, no weakness; 1, some 
      subjective weakness and/or walking with assistance; 2, the patient was wheelchair 
      bound; and 3, the patient was bedridden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The t test was used 
      for paired and unpaired data; Wilcoxon signed rank and Fisher exact tests were 
      incorporated for nonparametric data. Any values of P<.05 were considered 
      significant. RESULTS: Prior to surgery, 2 patients in group A reported degree 3 
      weakness; 5, degree 2 weakness; and 14, degree 1 weakness. Three months after 
      surgery, the peak force was noticed to have increased from 185 +/- 56 N to 249 +/- 
      82 N (mean +/- SD) (n = 11, P = .003), and the average force showed an increase from 
      136 +/- 45 N to 202 +/- 69 N (n = 11, P = .003). Postoperatively, only 5 patients 
      had degree 1 weakness, 1 had degree 2 weakness, and none had degree 3 weakness. The 
      patient with degree 2 weakness after surgery had diabetes mellitus and a femoral 
      neck fracture prior to parathyroidectomy. Improvement in condition of general 
      weakness was found (P<.001) between preoperative and postoperative periods. Serum 
      levels of calcium were higher in group A (2.82 +/- 0.23 mmol/L [11.3 +/- 0.9 mg/dL]) 
      than in group B (2.64 +/- 0.27 mmol/L [10.6 +/- 1.1 mg/dL]) (P = .013), and serum 
      levels of parathyroid hormone (intact) were lower in group A (108.9 +/- 39.2 pmol/L) 
      than in group B (139.8 +/- 39.6 pmol/L) (P = .006). Except for sex, other data such 
      as phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels, age, and duration of dialysis were 
      not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: General weakness that 
      is commonly observed in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism is found more 
      frequently in women and only in patients with diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive 
      nephropathy. Patients with general weakness had relatively higher levels of calcium 
      and lower levels of parathyroid hormone (intact). We found that improvement of 
      muscle power and general weakness can be achieved by parathyroidectomy and 
      autotransplantation. In addition to itchy skin, bone pain, and soft tissue 
      calcification, general weakness that may cause disability is also an indication for 
      surgery in secondary hyperparathyrodism.

TI  - Is the dialysate calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/L suitable for Chinese patients 
      on maintenance hemodialysis?
PG  - 301-10
LID - 10.1007/s00223-013-9811-x [doi]
AB  - We studied the effects of increasing the dialysate calcium concentration (DCa) to 
      1.75 mmol/L on controlling chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder in 
      Chinese patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). We reviewed the data of MHD 
      patients in one center (cohort 1) during prior 10 years and analyzed the risk 
      factors of mortality and transference calcification (TC) in120 MHD patients 
      surviving in 2003 (cohort 2). A multicenter, prospective, parallel-group, controlled 
      trial (cohort 3) was also conducted from January 2011 to December 2012. The DCa at 
      one center was increased from 1.5 to 1.75 mmol/L but was not changed at the other 
      two centers. The clinical outcomes, biochemical parameters, medicine treatments, and 
      TC markers [aortic arch calcification score (AoACS)] were compared between groups. 
      In cohort 1, the annual mean serum iPTH increased significantly over 10 years. In 
      cohort 1, 72 patients survived for 10 years, whose doses of calcium salts and active 
      vitamin D3 and AoACs increased progressively. In cohort 2, the main cause of death 
      was cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) (n = 18, 48.6 %). Male sex and lower serum 
      calcium concentrations were independent risk factors for CCVD mortality. In cohort 
      3, serum phosphorus, iPTH, and 25(OH)D decreased and serum calcium increased 
      significantly; also, the doses of calcium and vitamin D3 decreased from 2011 to 2012 
      in the DCa 1.75 group. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes 
      either between groups or between the two calendar years. Our results indicate that 
      increasing DCa to 1.75 mmol/L can decrease the elevated levels of serum iPTH and 
      phosphorus, reduce the doses of calcium and vitamin D3, and be safe for short 
      periods of time.

TI  - Association of calcium channel blockers and mortality in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 511-5
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease show disturbances of calcium metabolism, 
      including calcification of arterial walls. Such patients show increased mortality, 
      in particular due to increased cardiovascular-associated deaths. The association of 
      calcium channel blockers and mortality in patients undergoing haemodialysis was 
      investigated. A total of 188 patients who were receiving haemodialysis as of July 
      1998 were followed up for 30 months. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, 
      laboratory and clinical data, medication and dialysis prescription, were obtained. 
      As of December 2000, 51 of the patients (27%) had died. In the deceased group, age 
      was significantly higher, body mass index was significantly lower, and smoking was 
      significantly more frequent compared with the survival group (each P <0.001). The 
      percentage of patients taking calcium channel blockers was significantly higher in 
      the survival group. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that 
      haemodialysis patients assigned calcium channel blocker therapy had a significantly 
      lower risk of mortality [relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67); P 
      <0.001]. Thus, in haemodialysis patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular 
      events, administration of calcium channel blockers was associated with lower 
      mortality.

TI  - Pulmonary calcification in hemodialyzed patients detected by technetium-99m 
      diphosphonate scanning.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - Metastatic pulmonary calcification, a well-known complication in patients with 
      chronic disease, has been demonstrated postmortem in patients with a negative chest 
      X-ray. Recently, scintigrams with bone-seeking radionuclides have been used to 
      detect such subclinical pulmonary calcium deposits. We describe 23 patients on 
      maintenance hemodialysis with no evidence of pulmonary calcification on chest X-ray 
      who were prospectively studied by lung scanning with a bone-seeking radionuclide and 
      pulmonary function testing. Of the 23 patients, 14 (61%) had a positive 
      technetium-99m diphosphonate (99mTc-DP) scan (group 1). These patients were on 
      dialysis 38 +/- 5 months compared with 12 +/- 4 months in 9 patients with a negative 
      scan (group 2) (P less than 0.01). Age, sex, blood pressure, hematocrit, serum 
      calcium, phosphorous, bicarbonate, magnesium, and calcium X phosphorus product, as 
      well as parathyroid hormone level did not differ between the two groups. Of 10 
      group-1 patients tested, 7 had abnormal pulmonary diffusion capacity compared with 
      non in 5 group-2 patients tested (P = 0.014). Histologic examination of the lung in 
      1 group-1 patients who expired revealed calcification (amorphous on X-ray 
      diffraction), whereas none was found in 1 group-2 patients autopsied. These 
      observations suggest that in patients on maintenance hemodialysis, pulmonary 
      scanning with 99mTc-DP is a sensitive method for detecting pulmonary metastatic 
      calcification, which may be associated with an abnormality in pulmonary diffusion 
      capacity.

TI  - Bone mass does not correlate with the serum fibroblast growth factor 23 in 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 102-7
AB  - Circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) increases renal phosphate excretion, 
      decreases bone mineralization and is markedly increased in hemodialysis patients. 
      Bone cells express fibroblast growth receptor 1, suggesting that FGF23 could alter 
      bone mineralization by means of a direct effect on the skeleton and/or secondarily 
      due to hypophosphatemia. To distinguish between these possibilities we measured 
      serum concentrations of FGF23, parathyroid hormone, phosphate, calcium, and markers 
      of bone remodeling, and assessed bone mineral density in 99 hemodialysis patients. 
      FGF23 concentrations were increased in all hemodialysis patients, even in those 
      without hyperphosphatemia, and positively correlated with serum phosphate but not 
      with parathyroid hormone. Hemodialysis did not decrease the serum FGF23 
      concentration. We found no significant correlation between serum FGF23 levels and 
      bone mineral density. Further analysis by gender or T-score did not modify these 
      results. Serum markers of bone remodeling significantly correlated with parathyroid 
      hormone but not with FGF23 levels. The increase in serum FGF23 concentration in 
      hemodialysis patients cannot be solely ascribed to hyperphosphatemia. Our study 
      suggests that the effects of FGF23 on bone mineralization are mainly due to 
      hypophosphatemia and not a direct effect on bone.

      Morphological changes and occurrence of acquired cysts of the native kidneys in 
      patients with chronic renal failure].
PG  - 1140-7
AB  - As morphological changes of the native kidneys, the presence of acquired cysts, 
      intra-renal calcification and renal tumor was investigated mainly by ultrasonography 
      and computed tomography in 151 patients with chronic renal failure. 1) Among 140 
      uremic patients caused by medical diseases. 40 patients had simple cysts, and 37 had 
      acquired cystic disease of the kidneys (ACDK). However 4, uremic patients caused by 
      urological diseases were not seen to be with an acquired cysts. 2) The patients with 
      ACDK were with significantly longer durations of dialysis therapy than those with 
      simple cysts or no cysts. Furthermore, the patients with ACDK were younger than

      patients with cystic disease (simple cyst, ACDK and polycystic disease) than in

TI  - Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study 
      evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.
PG  - 263
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved 
      knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We 
      assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size 
      (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification 
      (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a 
      prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-four 
      dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included 
      in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. 
      Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC 
      score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels 
      (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the 
      multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. 
      RESULTS: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification 
      scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) 
      died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart 
      failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were 
      included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), 
      area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], 
      AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) 
      were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant 
      after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not 
      increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not 
      improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on 
      multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges 
      were based on 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on 
      chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis 
      patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac 
      size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent 
      hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve 
      prognostication in this population.

TI  - Role of coronary artery calcification score on the decrease in GFR among subjects 
      with CT coronary angiography.
PG  - 24-30
LID - 10.3109/10641963.2011.628725 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Higher levels of coronary artery calcification score (CACS) are 
      associated not only with an increased risk for cardiovascular death, but also with 
      lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs). However, its role in renal disease 
      progression in patients has not been elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 
      the change of estimated GFR in 279 nondialytic outpatients, who had undergone 
      computed tomographic coronary angiography and follow-up over a period of 3 months. 
      RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 57.7 ± 10.5 years, and the mean GFR 
      was 88.2 ± 15.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Although there was no difference in baseline GFR 
      between the CACS ≤ 200 AU group (n = 240) and the CACS > 200 AU group (n = 39), the 
      latter group had a lower level of final GFR and higher annual reduction rate of GFR 
      than the former group after an observation period of 13.1 ± 5.97 months. After 
      adjusting for confounding variables, including age, gender, baseline GFR, albumin, 
      and proteinuria, high levels of CACS showed an independent association with an 
      annual reduction rate of GFR (r = -0.142, P = .048). CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      suggest that CACS was related to an annual decrease in GFR and may predict the 
      faster decline in GFR in patients with symptoms requiring computed tomographic 
      coronary angiography.

TI  - Study design and subject baseline characteristics in the ADVANCE Study: effects of 
      cinacalcet on vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1916-23
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet 
      plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with Chronic Kidney 
      Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the effect of 
      cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of active vitamin D 
      on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis patients. We 
      report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject characteristics. METHODS: 
      ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized, open-label study. Adult 
      haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (intact 
      parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC 
      score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score (>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and 
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin 
      D (cinacalcet group) or flexible dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The 
      study had three phases: screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC 
      scores obtained by cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and 
      weeks 28 and 52. The primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from 
      baseline to Week 52. RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or 
      control. Mean age was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 
      36.7 months (range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the 
      Agatston method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score 
      was independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH. 
      Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The 
      ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
      vascular calcification.

TI  - Off-pump coronary surgery: surgical strategy for the high-risk patient.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective study, we compared two groups of consecutive patients 
      operated by the same team during the year 2000 for coronary artery disease with the 
      use of extracorporeal circulation (group 1, n=230) or on the beating heart using the 
      Octopus II plus stabiliser (group 2, n=228). High-risk patients were identified by a 
      EuroSCORE plus 6. EuroSCORE definitions and predicted risk models were utilized to 
      compare the variables of the groups. METHODS: There were no significant differences 
      between the preoperative variables of the groups in age, gender, left ventricular 
      function, diabetes and peripheral vascular and renal disease as is indicated by the 
      Euroscore (resp. 4.7/5.1 p=0.107). Calcification of the ascending aorta and chronic 
      obstructive lung disease were statistically significant more prevalent in the 
      beating heart group. No differences in preoperative variables in the high-risk 
      patients group (Euroscore 8.5/8.1 p=0.356) except for calcification of the ascending 
      aorta. RESULTS: All patients underwent a full revascularisation through a midline 
      sternotomy. Significant more distal anastomoses were performed in group 1 (3.7 per 
      patient (1-6)) with regard to group 2 (2.9 per patient (1-6)). Anesthesia, 
      postoperative treatment and follow up were equal for both groups. A significant 
      lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.010), shorter ICU stay (p=0.031) and 
      renal insufficiency (p=0.033) was reported in group 2. In the low risk group, we 
      could not diagnose any difference between the two groups, except for atrial 
      fibrillation. The benefits of the beating heart surgery however were more pronounced 
      in the high-risk patient as is indicated by a significant reduction of the ICU stay 
      by 1 day (3.5d/2.5d (p=0.028)), better preservation of the renal function (p=0.017) 
      and a significant reduction of the length of hospital stay by more than two days 
      (p=0.040). A lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, however not significant. 
      CONCLUSION: In our experience, beating heart surgery is a safe alternative for 
      conventional coronary heart surgery. High-risk patients do benefit most from this 
      technique. It became our first choice in the elderly patient and patients presenting 
      with higher co-morbidities.

TI  - Association of serum fetuin-A levels with mortality in dialysis patients.
PG  - 202-7
AB  - Calcifying atherosclerosis is an active process, which is controlled by 
      calcification inhibitors and inducers. Fetuin-A, an acute phase glycoprotein, is one 
      of the more powerful circulating inhibitors of hydroxyapatite formation. A 
      prospective multicenter cohort study was initiated to include both hemodialysis (HD) 
      and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in an evaluation of the association of serum 
      fetuin-A levels with both cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality. An increase in 
      the serum fetuin-A concentration of 0.1 g/l was associated with a significant 
      reduction in all-cause mortality of 13%. There was a significant 17% reduction in 
      non-CV mortality and a near significant reduction in CV mortality. This association 
      of fetuin-A and mortality rates was comparable in both HD and PD patients even when 
      corrected for factors, including but not limited to age, gender, primary kidney 
      disease, C-reactive protein levels, and nutritional status. We conclude that serum 
      fetuin-A concentrations may be a general predictor of mortality in dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - Impact of high coronary artery calcification score (CACS) on survival in patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) is a noninvasive measure of 
      coronary artery calcification and, therefore, could be a marker of developing 
      cardiovascular disease. Whether the coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a 
      prognostic marker in chronic dialysis patients is not known. METHODS: In the present 
      study, the mortality rate was observed in relation to the baseline CACS. EBCT was 
      performed in 104 chronic hemodialysis patients (62 men and 42 women) in one dialysis 
      unit. The mean (SD) duration of hemodialysis was 48.7 (62.6) months at the time of 
      EBCT. The mean (SD) age at EBCT was 55.9 (13.6) years, ranging from 23 to 88 years. 
      The duration of follow-up was 43.8 (19.3) months after the EBCT. Cox proportional 
      hazard analysis was performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival after 
      adjusting for age, sex, duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, serum 
      albumin, and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: The CACS was distributed from zero to 5896, with 
      a median of 200. During the study period, 24 patients (15 men and 9 women) died, 7 
      in the low CACS group (<200) and 17 in the high CACS group (> or =200). The 5-year 
      cumulative survival rate was 84.2% in the low CACS group and 67.9% in the high CACS 
      group. The adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) of death was 1.001 
      (1.000-1.002); P = 0.0003, for the absolute value of CACS. CONCLUSIONS: The present 
      study suggested that CACS was an independent predictor of death in patients on 
      chronic hemodialysis. Patients with a high CACS should be carefully monitored and 
      evaluated for reversible prognostic factors such as dyslipidemia and, probably, 
      hyperphosphatemia and a high value for the calcium x phosphate product.Electron-beam 
      computed tomography (EBCT) is a noninvasive measure of coronary artery calcification 
      and, therefore, could be a marker of developing cardiovascular disease. Whether the 
      coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a prognostic marker in chronic 
      dialysis patients is not known.

TI  - B-type natriuretic peptide predicts stroke of presumable cardioembolic origin in 
      addition to coronary artery calcification.
PG  - 914-21
LID - 10.1111/ene.12411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: B-type natriuretric peptide (BNP) is a marker of cardiac 
      dysfunction that is released from myocytes in response to ventricular wall stress. 
      Previous studies suggested that BNP predicts stroke events in addition to classical 
      risk factors. It was suggested that the BNP-associated risk results from coronary 
      atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation. METHODS: Three thousand six hundred and 
      seventy five subjects from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study 
      (45-75 years; 47.6% men) without previous stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial 
      infarcts, open cardiac valve surgery, pacemakers and defibrillators were followed up 
      over 110.1 ± 23.1 months. Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine 
      BNP as a stroke predictor in addition to vascular risk factors (age, gender, 
      systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, 
      diabetes, smoking), renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation/known heart failure and 
      coronary artery calcification. RESULTS: Eighty-nine incident strokes occurred (80 
      ischaemic, 9 hemorrhagic). Subjects suffering stroke had significantly higher BNP 
      values at baseline than the remaining subjects [26.3 (Q1; Q3 = 12.9; 51.0) vs. 17.4 
      (9.4; 31.4); P < 0.001]. In a multivariable regression, log10 BNP was an independent 
      stroke predictor [hazard ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-3.41; 
      P = 0.017] in addition to age (1.24 per 5 years, CI 1.04-1.49; P = 0.016), systolic 
      blood pressure (1.25 per 10 mmHg, CI 1.14-1.38; P < 0.001), smoking (2.05, CI 
      1.24-3.39; P = 0.005), atrial fibrillation/heart failure (2.25, CI 1.05-4.83; 
      P = 0.037) and computed-tomography-based log10 (coronary artery calcification + 1) 
      (1.47, CI 1.15-1.88; P = 0.002). Log10 BNP predicted stroke in men but not women, 
      both in subjects ≤65 and >65 years. In subsequent analyses, BNP discriminated the 
      incidence of cardioembolic stroke (P for trend = 0.001), but not stroke of 
      macroangiopathic (P = 0.555), microangiopathic (P = 0.809) or unknown (P = 0.367) 
      origin. CONCLUSIONS: BNP predicts presumable cardioembolic stroke independent of 
      coronary calcification.

TI  - Low serum fetuin-A concentration predicts poor outcome only in the presence of 
      inflammation in prevalent haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 804-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02032.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular 
      calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney 
      disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote 
      vascular calcification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of 
      inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 
      222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. RESULTS: Serum fetuin correlated 
      negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating 
      inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher 
      mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was 
      lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and 
      inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly 
      independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed 
      compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same 
      variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high 
      fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with 
      high fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are 
      associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of 
      inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and 
      low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD 
      patients.

TI  - Study on the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vascular 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients with consideration of seasonal variation in 
      vitamin D levels.
PG  - 563-8
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between seasonal 
      variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification. METHODS: As a prospective 
      observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We have assessed serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer (September) and winter 
      (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association of serum 25D level with 
      vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D levels 
      were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were 
      studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by Kauppila. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the summer and increased to 
      96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and diabetes were associated with 
      vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate analysis, 25D levels were inversely 
      related to vascular calcification. However, after correcting for confounding 
      factors, this relationship lost statistical significance. Multivariate analysis 
      showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels were directly 
      associated with a higher VCS. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent 
      in HD patients with marked seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be 
      identified as an independent predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.

TI  - Effect of the duration of dialysis on survival in a cohort of chronic haemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 782-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in chronic 
      haemodialysis (HD) patients, and usually progress with time. Whether the length of 
      dialysis treatment in chronic HD patients is a significant independent risk factor 
      of death is not clear. METHODS: A cohort of chronic HD patients from the Okinawa 
      Dialysis Study, n=1243 (720 men, 523 women), was followed from January 1991 to 
      December 2000, and their survival rates were compared against the duration of HD, 
      which was calculated in months from the start of dialysis therapy to January 1991. A 
      Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to examine the influence of 
      the duration of dialysis on survival, after adjusting for other factors such as age, 
      sex, serum albumin concentration and diastolic blood pressure. The hazards ratio and 
      95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated in both diabetic and non-diabetic 
      patients. RESULTS: The mean duration of dialysis was 61.9 months and ranged from 1 
      to 233 months. The numbers of patients who died, underwent renal transplantation or 
      were transferred outside Okinawa were 568 (45.7%), 61 (4.9%) and 14 (1.1%), 
      respectively, during the study. The hazards ratio (95% CI) was 1.002 (1.000-1.004, 
      P=0.0245) for non-diabetic patients and 1.006 (1.001-1.011, P=0.0214) for diabetic 
      patients, suggesting that the longer the duration of dialysis, the greater the risk 
      of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that prolonged dialysis is a significant 
      predictor of death in chronic HD patients, in particular diabetic patients. Whether 
      this is related to the progression of the atherosclerotic process or to uraemic 
      conditions remains to be shown.

TI  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients show high prevalence of carotid 
      artery calcification which is associated with a higher left ventricular mass index.
PG  - 848-52
AB  - This study examined intima-media thickness and arterial plaque occurrence in the 
      carotid and brachial arteries in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) 
      patients. The study compared 25 CAPD patients with 25 normotensive age- and 
      sex-matched controls. Intima-media thickness and presence of plaque in carotid and 
      brachial artery were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode 
      echocardiography. Left ventricular mass was calculated using the Penn Convection 
      equation. Blood samples were obtained to assess levels of phosphorus, total calcium, 
      serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and lipid profiles. Compared to the control 
      group, CAPD patients had greater mean carotid and brachial intima-media thickness, 
      and a higher proportion of subjects with calcified plaques. The left ventricular 
      mass index was higher in CAPD patients with carotid artery calcified plaques 
      compared to CAPD patients without carotid artery calcified plaques. CAPD patients 
      with such plaque were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus, higher 
      C-reactive protein levels and a lower 2-yr survival rate. The present study showed 
      an high prevalence of carotid calcification in CAPD patients and those with such 
      calcification had a greater incidence of diabetes mellitus, higher C-reactive 
      protein levels and left ventricular mass index, and a lower survival rate.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification in haemodialysis patients: role of calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.
PG  - 2037-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased 
      frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the 
      potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. METHODS: A total of 92 chronic HD 
      patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control 
      subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was 
      determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of 
      haemodialysis. RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients 
      than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% 
      vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older 
      than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, 
      had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the 
      highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and 
      the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also found a 
      positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was 
      found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple 
      stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters 
      for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more 
      frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and 
      with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age 
      (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and 
      calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support 
      careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage 
      renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.

TI  - Effects of age, sex, and polycystic disease on progressive bone disease of renal 
      failure.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - A study of 150 patients undergoing haemodialysis has shown that age had a striking 
      effect on the radiological presentation of renal bone disease, erosions being common 
      in the young and uncommon in older patients and vascular calcification showing 
      opposite trends to this. Men aged 20 to 59 years had a greater tendency to develop 
      erosions than did women in this age range. Examination of a group of 53 patients 
      over a period of five years showed that the half time for the development of 
      vascular calcification was 4.6 years, erosions 26.7 years, and fractures 6.9 years. 
      Nine out of 16 polycystic patients matched for age and sex with 50 controls did not 
      develop erosions and had consistently less vascular calcification than the controls 
      when examined over a six-year period.

TI  - [Prevalence of vertebral fractures and aortic calcifications in hemodialysis 
      patients: comparison with a population of the same age and sex].
PG  - 106-11
AB  - Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence of 
      fractures, principally peripheral fractures. However, there are few studies focusing 
      on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover, aortic calcifications are very 
      common and are an independent predictive factor of vascular morbidity and mortality. 
      The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and 
      vascular calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison with 
      a random sample of general population of similar age and from the same geographical 
      area (n = 624) and study their relationship with clinical, biochemical and 
      therapeutical data. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in HD patients and general 
      population was 19.1% and 24.1% respectively (non-significant statistical 
      differences). In both, sexes, the presence of vertebral fractures was positively 
      associated with age, mean maximum Ca, mean maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was 
      positively associated as well. On the other hand, the prevalence of aortic 
      calcifications was much higher in HD patients (77.9% vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). HD was a 
      risk factor for aortic calcification in women [OR = 7.7 (IC 95% = 2.6-22.9)] as in 
      men [OR = 5 (IC 95% = 1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular calcifications were more frequent 
      in HD patients, it reached 57.4% compared with 17% of general population (p < 
      0.001). Both, in women (64.5% vs 13.3% p < 0.001) and in men (51.4% vs 20.9%), 
      respectively (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was 
      similar in HD patients and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and 
      severity of aortic calcifications was higher in HD patients.

TI  - Polymorphism in the human matrix Gla protein gene is associated with the progression 
      of vascular calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 882-9
LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0785-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is one of the important proteins inhibiting 
      vascular calcification (VC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the 
      promoter and coding regions of the MGP gene affect the transcriptional activity. In 
      this study, we investigated the relationship between the SNPs and progression of VC 
      in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of 134 MHD patients whose VC could be 
      followed by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) examinations. MGP-SNPs 
      (T-138C, rs1800802 and G-7A, rs1800801) were determined. The progression speed of VC 
      was examined by plotting the abdominal aortic calcium volume scores. RESULTS: The 
      progression speed of VC of patients with the CC genotype of T-138C was significantly 
      slower than that of patients with the CT or TT genotype. Multiple regression 
      analysis showed that CT/TT genotype, greater age at the beginning of MHD, male sex, 
      high levels of calcium × phosphate, low levels of high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of 
      ferritin and non-use of angiotensin II receptor blockers were significantly 
      associated with progression of VC. CONCLUSIONS: The MGP-138CC genotype may be 
      associated with slower progression of VC in MHD patients. The genotype of the MGP 
      gene will be a genomic biomarker that is predictive of VC progression.

TI  - Low incidence of fatal coronary heart disease in Pima Indians despite high 
      prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
PG  - 987-95
AB  - The incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) was determined in a population 
      of Pima Indians from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona. Between 1975 and 
      1984, 394 deaths occurred among 4,828 subjects aged 5 years or older, and 199 of 
      these occurred in the 1,093 persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Only 28 
      deaths were attributed to CHD; all occurred among the 689 diabetic persons 45 years 
      of age or older. No CHD deaths occurred among the 419 nondiabetic subjects 45 years 
      of age or older. The rate of fatal CHD among the diabetic subjects was higher in men 
      than in women and increased with advancing age and duration of diabetes. A higher 
      incidence of fatal CHD was associated with proteinuria, renal insufficiency, medial 
      arterial calcification, diabetic retinopathy, insulin therapy, and an abnormal 
      electrocardiogram. In Pima Indians aged 50-79 years, the incidence of fatal CHD was 
      less than half that found in the Framingham population after controlling for age, 
      sex, and diabetes (incidence rate ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.7). 
      Factors protecting Pima Indians from fatal CHD may include racial heritage, low 
      serum concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and rarity of 
      heavy smoking. Among the diabetic subjects, mortality from diabetic renal disease, 
      which shows many of the same risk factors, may selectively compete and remove those 
      at risk for fatal CHD. This would not, however, explain the lack of fatal CHD among 
      the nondiabetic subjects. Fatal CHD shares many of the risk factors associated with 
      the specific microvascular complications of diabetes, and diabetes and its 
      associated attributes are the major predictors of fatal CHD in this population.

TI  - Study on the relationship of serum fetuin-A concentration with aortic stiffness in 
      patients on dialysis.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in aortic stiffness, as reflected by an increase in pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) or aortic augmentation index (AI) is an important predictor of 
      cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Dysregulation of calcification 
      inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, is involved in vascular pathology in dialysis patients 
      and fetuin-A is inversely related to mortality in dialysis patients. In this study, 
      the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration and parameters of aortic stiffness 
      was investigated in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: In a 
      cross-sectional study we included 131 dialysis patients, aged 62+/-14 years (33 on 
      peritoneal dialysis and 98 on haemodialysis), and 41 controls, aged 60+/-8 years. 
      Time-averaged pre-dialysis values of serum albumin, Ca, P and intact parathyroid 
      hormone were included in multiregression analysis, as were high-sensitivity 
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fetuin-A, age, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and dialysis 
      modality. PWV and AI were measured with the SphygmoCor device. RESULTS: Mean 
      fetuin-A concentration in dialysis patients (0.63+/-0.16 g/l) did not differ from 
      controls (0.63+/-0.11 g/l). Median hsCRP levels in dialysis patients were higher 
      compared with controls (4.0 vs 1.9 mg/l; P<0.0001). PWV but not AI was higher in 
      dialysis patients than in controls (9.9 vs 7.9 m/s; P<0.0001). In univariate 
      analysis in dialysis patients, fetuin-A levels were inversely related to both PWV (r 
      = - 0.25, P = 0.007) and AI (r = - 0.26, P = 0.006), respectively. However, after 
      correction for age, gender, MAP and diabetes mellitus, this relation lost 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In a dialysis population with a relatively 
      low level of inflammatory activity, the soluble calcification inhibitor fetuin-A 
      could not be identified as an independent predictor of aortic stiffness as measured 
      with PWV and AI.

TI  - Different risk factors for peripheral vascular calcification between diabetic and 
      non-diabetic haemodialysis patients--importance of glycaemic control.
PG  - 1446-8
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been 
      emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic 
      haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are 
      not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between 
      haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: We examined 421 patients 
      on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II 
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62+/-10 years old) 
      and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59+/-13 years old). Hand 
      roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of the hand 
      arteries was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic 
      patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in 
      diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) ( 
      p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular 
      calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of 
      haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower 
      predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular 
      calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of haemodialysis. In 
      diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk of calcification by 
      2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have shown 
      that poor glycaemic control, rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a 
      predictor of peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on 
      haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in 
      diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - Localisation of aluminium by histochemical and electron probe x-ray microanalytical 
      techniques in bone tissue of cases of renal osteodystrophy.
PG  - 1283-93
AB  - Histochemical studies and electron probe x-ray microanalysis for aluminium have been 
      performed on 16 samples of undecalcified bone from cases of renal osteodystrophy 
      associated with a syndrome suggestive of dialysis encephalopathy (five cases), age 
      and sex matched controls for these and a group of patients with chronic renal 
      failure (six cases) who have never been on haemodialysis. Aluminium was detected 
      only in the patients with a dialysis encephalopathy-like syndrome. This group had 
      significant histological bone disease the features of which were broadly consistent 
      with the so-called atypical renal osteomalacia which is thought to be due to a metal 
      toxin. Aluminium was demonstrated at the interface between osteoid and mineralised 
      tissue--that is, at the site of the calcification front, where it could interfere 
      with the mineralisation process. In the group of patients who had never been 
      subjected to haemodialysis there was also significant histological bone disease but 
      no evidence of aluminium accumulation. In this group the bone disease was of a more 
      typical pattern of osteomalacic changes coupled with those of hyperparathyroidism.

TI  - Left atrial diameter as an independent predictor of first clinical cardiovascular 
      events in middle-aged and elderly adults: the Strong Heart Study (SHS).
PG  - 412-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic left atrial (LA) volume has been documented to be an 
      independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Less is known about the predictive 
      ability of anteroposterior LA diameter, a simpler measure of LA size obtained 
      routinely during echocardiographic evaluation. METHODS: We investigated the 
      prognostic value of LA diameter for incident cardiovascular events in 2804 American 
      Indians free of clinical cardiovascular disease, valvular disease, and atrial 
      fibrillation. Echocardiographic variables were obtained using standardized methods, 
      and previously derived sex-specific partition values were used to define left 
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy indexed to height(2.7) (in meters) and LA enlargement 
      (> 4.2 cm in men, > 3.8 cm in women). Cardiovascular events included nonfatal 
      stroke, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and fatal cardiovascular 
      disease based on validated definitions. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7 
      years, 368 events occurred. LA diameter, both as a continuous and as a categorical 
      variable, was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular events in 
      unadjusted analyses. In multivariable analyses that adjusted for age, sex, body mass 
      index, hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, smoking, renal insufficiency, LV hypertrophy, abnormal LV systolic and 
      diastolic function, mitral annular calcification, fibrinogen, and C-reactive 
      protein, both LA diameter (risk ratio 1.04/mm, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, P < .002) and LA 
      enlargement (risk ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.17-2.10, P = .002) remained independent 
      predictors of first cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based 
      cohort, LA diameter independently predicted incident cardiovascular events after 
      adjustment for established clinical, echocardiographic, and inflammatory risk 
      factors. This simple measure of LA dilatation can identify individuals at heightened 
      risk who may warrant more aggressive risk factor modification.

TI  - The value of computed tomography-derived coronary artery calcification score in 
      coronary artery disease detection in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 683-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the value of coronary artery calcification (CAC) score in 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) detection in asymptomatic hemodialysis (HD) patients 
      by evaluating the association among CAC score, exercise electrocardiography (EECG), 
      and Thallium-201 dipyridamole scintigraphy. Correlation between aortic pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) and CAC score was also evaluated. METHODS: CAC score was assessed 
      with conventional computed tomography in 40 patients. Thirty patients completed EECG 
      and 25; those with a positive CAC score and/or a positive EECG performed Thallium 
      dipyridamole scintigraphy. Carotid-femoral PWV was assessed in all patients. 
      RESULTS: There was no association among CAC score and EECG or Thallium dipyridamole 
      scintigraphy. In contrast, CAC score was correlated with aortic PWV. CONCLUSION: The 
      previous results question the role of CAC score in the detection of CAD in 
      asymptomatic HD patients. The correlation between CAC score and aortic PWV raises 
      the possibility that CAC score represents more an indicator of coronary artery 
      medial wall calcification than a marker of CAD.

TI  - C-reactive protein is a significant predictor of vascular calcification of both 
      aorta and hand arteries.
PG  - 408-12
AB  - Although evidence has accumulated indicating a close relationship between 
      inflammation and atherosclerosis, the relationship between inflammation and vascular 
      calcification in patients with chronic renal failure is unclear. In the present 
      study, the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and vascular calcification 
      in dialysis patients was examined. Vascular calcification of the aorta and hand 
      arteries of 512 hemodialysis patients without significant infection (age 58.8 +/- 
      10.1 y; 305 men, 207 women) were examined by roentgenography of the lateral abdomen 
      and hands, respectively. Patients with a mean CRP level greater than 1.0 mg/L (n = 
      254) were older than those with a CRP level less than or equal to 1.0 mg/L (n = 258) 
      and had a longer duration of dialysis, lower serum albumin level, and higher 
      phosphate level ( P < .01, P < .05, P < .001, and P < .01, respectively). Prevalence 
      of vascular calcification of aorta and hand arteries in the former group was 
      significantly higher than in the latter (65.0% versus 43.8% for aorta, P < .0001; 
      and 25.0% versus 14.7% for hand arteries, P < .01). In a multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis adjusted for age, hemodialysis duration, sex, levels of calcium 
      and phosphate, and presence of diabetes, CRP level was a significant predictor for 
      the presence of aortic calcification (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quartile, 
      2.669; 95% confidence interval, 1.539-5.421, P = .0010) and of calcification of hand 
      arteries (odds ratio, 2.243; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-4.841; P = .0395). In 
      conclusion, the present study shows that increased levels of CRP are significantly 
      associated with the presence of vascular calcification in both aorta and hand 
      arteries (ie, with both atheromatous and medial forms of calcification), indicating 
      evidence for a relationship between inflammation and vascular calcification in 
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Arterial changes in paediatric haemodialysis patients undergoing renal 
      transplantation.
PG  - 2041-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between primary renal disease and arterial wall changes 
      in paediatric haemodialysis patients has been little studied. The aim of the present 
      work was to determine the influence of primary renal disease on arterial wall 
      pathology in uraemic paediatric patients. METHODS: Twelve paediatric haemodialysis 
      patients (seven girls, five boys) aged 11-17 years were included in the study. The 
      primary renal diseases were urinary malformations in six patients (uropathy group) 
      and acquired glomerular diseases (glomerulopathy group) in six patients. Age, sex 
      distribution, duration of chronic renal failure, duration of haemodialysis, blood 
      pressure, serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, fibrinogen, calcium, phosphorus 
      and parathyroid hormone levels were compared. Internal iliac artery samples were 
      obtained at the time of related-donor renal transplantation. Artery samples were 
      fixed in formaldehyde and sections were stained separately with haematoxylin and 
      eosin, Orcein, Verhoef-van Gieson, and Masson trichrome. RESULTS: Five arteries had 
      fibrous or fibroelastic intimal thickening, medial mucoid ground substance and 
      disruption of the internal elastic lamella. Two of these had microcalcification in 
      the intimal layer; another two demonstrated atheromatous plaques; the remaining five 
      were normal. These pathological changes were found in the arteries of all six 
      patients with uropathy, whereas of the six patients with glomerulopathy only one had 
      arterial changes (P<0.001). The duration of chronic renal failure was 4.8+/-1.9 
      years in the uropathy group and 2.2+/-1.2 in the glomerulopathy group (P<0.05). The 
      two groups were comparable in terms of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, 
      fibrinogen, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels, presence of hypertension, sex 
      distribution, and duration of haemodialysis. Plasma phosphorus and the calcium x 
      phosphate product were higher in the uropathy group than in the glomerulopathy group 
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that pathological changes are common 
      in the arteries of uraemic paediatric patients, and that calcification and 
      atherosclerosis are integral to this disease process. In our study, these 
      alterations were more common in the patients with uropathy. We speculate that the 
      patients with uropathy are more prone to these alterations due to slower progression 
      and a longer duration of renal insufficiency.

TI  - 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels inversely associate with risk for developing coronary 
      artery calcification.
PG  - 1805-12
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2008111157 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency associates with increased risk for cardiovascular events and 
      mortality, but the mechanism driving this association is unknown. Here, we tested 
      whether circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration associates with coronary 
      artery calcification (CAC), a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, in the 
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 1370 participants: 394 with and 
      976 without chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). At 
      baseline, CAC was prevalent among 723 (53%) participants. Among participants free of 
      CAC at baseline, 135 (21%) developed incident CAC during 3 yr of follow-up. Lower 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration did not associate with prevalent CAC but did 
      associate with increased risk for developing incident CAC, adjusting for age, 
      gender, race/ethnicity, site, season, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, 
      and kidney function. Further adjustment for BP, diabetes, C-reactive protein, and 
      lipids did not alter this finding. The association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with 
      incident CAC seemed to be stronger among participants with lower estimated GFR. 
      Circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations among participants with chronic 
      kidney disease did not significantly associate with prevalent or incident CAC in 
      adjusted models. In conclusion, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations associate 
      with increased risk for incident CAC. Accelerated development of atherosclerosis may 
      underlie, in part, the increased cardiovascular risk associated with vitamin D 
      deficiency.

TI  - Lower concentrations of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be associated 
      with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans with normal renal 
      function.
PG  - 1465-70
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.110.001974 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum phosphorus concentrations are associated with an increased risk of 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in patients with renal insufficiency. 
      This association has also been reported in Western individuals without chronic 
      kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: It is unclear, however, whether this correlation 
      occurs in Korean individuals without CKD, who usually ingest less phosphorus than do 
      Western individuals. DESIGN: We reviewed the findings in 402 healthy Korean adults 
      with a mean (±SD) age of 50.8 ± 8.5 y (n = 257 men and 145 women) and a glomerular 
      filtration rate of 83.5 ± 14.1 mL/min, who underwent health screening with 
      electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). The study population was separated into 4 
      groups on the basis of the coronary calcium concentration (Agatston score: 0, >0 to 
      ≤10, >10 to ≤100, and >100). Mean serum phosphorus concentrations, measured ≥10 y 
      before EBCT, were compared. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 
      0.001), male sex (P = 0.002), family history of CVD (P = 0.006), serum glucose (P = 
      0.003), and serum phosphorus >3.6 mg/dL (P = 0.008) were significant factors 
      influencing the coronary calcification group with an Agatston score >100, when those 
      with an Agatston score of 0 were considered as the reference group. Compared with 
      the group with a serum phosphorus concentration ≤3.3 mg/dL, the OR of an Agatston 
      score >100 in individuals with a serum phosphorus concentration >3.6 to ≤3.9 mg/dL 
      was 3.89 (95% CI: 1.43, 10.63; P = 0.008) and in those with a serum phosphorus 
      concentration >3.9 mg/dL was 3.17 (95% CI: 1.19, 8.41; P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: A 
      lower concentration of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be associated 
      with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans with normal renal 
      function.

TI  - Association of pelvic arterial calcification with arteriovenous thigh graft failure 
      in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2564-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic 
      kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal of 
      the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are 
      associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 
      54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular 
      access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the 
      abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes 
      unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the 
      graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common 
      iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 5-point 
      scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to complete the 
      anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed. RESULTS: There was a 
      high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular calcification (kappa = 0.801). 
      Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on 
      CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six 
      patients (50%) with moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft 
      failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was 
      lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two 
      groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum 
      calcium, serum phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSION: There is a 
      strong association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of 
      thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is 
      predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.

TI  - Clinical studies of destructive spondyloarthropathy in long-term hemodialysis 
      patients.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Destructive spondyloarthropathy (DSA) has recently been recognized in hemodialysis 
      patients. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence, preferred sites, risk 
      factors, early radiological manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      relation to other radiological features and biochemical variables in DSA. In 405 
      patients undergoing dialysis for 0.2-20.5 years (average 8.2) with a mean age of 
      51.9 years (range 24-84), a diagnosis of DSA was made for 37 (9.1%). The preferred 
      site of DSA was the lower cervical spine. MRI indicated a low signal intensity of 
      the involved vertebral regions on both T1- and T2-weighted images and thus appeared 
      useful in the exclusion of osteomyelitis showing high-intensity T2-weighted images. 
      The patients were divided into three groups according to radiological findings: 
      those showing (A) the presence of DSA, (B) vertebral rim erosion (VRE) without DSA, 
      and (C) the absence of DSA and VRE. Patient age at onset of dialysis (p less than 
      0.01) and duration of hemodialysis (p less than 0.05) appeared to be the associated 
      risk factors for DSA. DSA was found correlated with carpal tunnel syndrome (p less 
      than 0.01), carpal bone cystic radiolucency (p less than 0.01), and amyloid deposit 
      (p less than 0.01). All the groups were essentially the same with respect to the 
      incidence of ectopic calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, biochemical 
      markers and sex distribution. The results of this study show DSA to be associated 
      with dialysis amyloidosis.

TI  - Coronary artery diameter and left ventricular function in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis treatment: comparison between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining 
      left ventricular function by evaluating coronary artery diameter in patients with 
      end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis treatment. METHODS: We studied 
      12 diabetic and 12 nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment 
      without significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries. Patients 
      were matched for age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis and incidence of major 
      coronary risk factors. Left ventricular wall thickness (septal and posterior walls) 
      and left ventricular diameter (end-diastolic and systolic phases), were measured by 
      echocardiography. Hemodynamic measurements and coronary angiography were performed 
      on the day of hemodialysis and coronary artery diameter at the proximal and mid 
      portion of three major coronary arteries were measured using the computed 
      densitometry method. RESULTS: Right and left anterior descending and circumflex 
      coronary artery diameters were all significantly smaller and the frequency of 
      coronary artery calcification was higher in diabetic (58%) compared to nondiabetic 
      (8%) patients. Although there were no significant differences in left ventricular 
      wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, mean right atrial pressure and cardiac 
      index between the two groups, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 
      significantly higher in diabetic (22 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared to nondiabetic patients 
      (14 +/- 5 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Despite that there were no significant stenoses of the 
      major epicardial coronary arteries, diffuse luminal narrowing of the epicardial 
      coronary arteries in diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment was 
      associated with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

TI  - Correlation of radial bone mineral content with total body calcium in chronic renal 
      failure.
PG  - 910-9
AB  - Loss of bone mineral of the skeleton in renal disease can be measured directly by 
      total body neutron activation analysis (TBNAA), and also by an absorptiometric 
      technique applied to the appendicular skeleton (radius). In the present study the 
      results of these two techniques are compared in 25 patients with renal 
      insufficiency, 53 patients with end-stage renal failure on dialysis, and 24 normal 
      control subjects. It is apparent that there is good correlation between total body 
      calcium(TBCa) and bone mineral content (BMC) in all groups studied. The correlation 
      in the normal contrast group was 0.944 as compared to 0.919 for the renal patients 
      and 0.892 for patients with end-stage renal failure on dialysis. In order to measure 
      the relative deficit in TBCa in individual patients from the absolute Ca 
      measurement, it is necessary to normalize the data for sex, age, and skeletal size. 
      For this purpose, an empirically derived relationship was used to predict the normal 
      skeletal Ca in each subject, based on weight, height, sex, and age. The measured 
      TBCa divided by the predicted TBCa is referred to as the calcium ratio. This ratio 
      is useful in expressing the relative deficit of Ca in individual renal patients. In 
      similar manner, BMC data were normalized, with the same relationship used to obtain 
      BMC ratios. The normalization procedures allow both the TBCa and BMC measurements to 
      be used to quantitate the Ca deficit in individual patients with renal 
      insufficiency. However, the correlation coefficient relating changes in TBCa and BMC 
      in individual patients on dialysis was very poor (0.25). It is clear that the BMC 
      measurement alone cannot always predict the level of the total body Ca in individual 
      patients with renal failure. In like manner, TBCa measurement alone does not define 
      the distribution of total body Ca between the skeleton and soft tissue in these 
      patients. However, taken together, the BMC measure along with that of TBCa does 
      suggest possible alterations in the skeletal calcium distribution associated with 
      renal disease.

TI  - A comparative study of atherosclerosis and osteopenia in elderly and young 
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - The effects of aging on atherosclerosis and osteopenia in hemodialysis patients were 
      investigated. Eighty patients on maintenance hemodialysis were subdivided according 
      to age into old (greater than or equal to 65 years old, N = 40) and young (less than 
      65 years old, N = 40). Biochemical, radiologic, and biophysical studies were 
      performed in each patient to assess the degree of atherosclerosis and osteopenia. 
      Compared to age-matched controls, patients in the old group exhibited a 
      significantly higher aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and old female patients had a 
      significantly lower bone mineral content/bone width (BMC/W). Elderly patients also 
      had a significantly higher aortic PWV and higher grade of aortic calcification as 
      assessed radiologically; in contrast, the BMC/W was lower. Concerning sex 
      differences, elderly male patients had the highest average grade of aortic 
      calcification, the lowest serum Pi, [Ca] x [Pi], and immunoreactive parathyroid 
      hormone concentrations, while elderly female patients had the lowest BMC/W and 
      highest incidence of osteopenia. These observations suggest that elderly male 
      hemodialysis patients are more prone to develop atherosclerosis and elderly female 
      hemodialysis patients to develop advanced osteopenia.

TI  - Osteodystrophy of diabetics in chronic dialysis: a histomorphometric study.
PG  - 297-301
AB  - A decreased incidence of hyperparathyroidism in diabetic uremic patients has been 
      reported, but comprehensive bone histomorphometric studies on uremic diabetic 
      osteodistrophy are scarce. We present here the results of static and dynamic bone 
      morphometry in 13 diabetic patients on dialysis (DCD) and their comparison with a 
      pair-matched group of nondiabetic uremics with similar age, sex, and time on 
      dialysis (NCDC), and with a group of 17 normals (N). Diabetic bone showed: (1) Low 
      trabecular volume (Vt 9.9% in DCD and 22.8% in N), (2) Moderately increased 
      remodeling values of intermediate intensity between N and NDCD values (Sf = 19.3% in 
      DCD, 37.4% in NDCD, and 8.8 +/- 6% in N, Sr = 4.3% in DCD, 7.3% in NDCD and 2.04 +/- 
      0.9% in N), and (3) Moderate fibrosis (Sfib 1.2% in DCD, 12.9% in NDCD). Besides 
      these confirmatory results, two suggestions emerged from the study: (1) The relative 
      number of cells: osteoclast density (OI) and osteoblasts (Ob/OID) appears to be 
      lower, not only than NDCD values but also lower than N values (OI = 0.04 c/mm. in 
      DCD, 0.31 in NDCD, and 0.14 in N; Ob/OID = 5.58% in DCD, 14.6 in NDCD and 22.12 +/- 
      9% m N). (2) Dynamic behavior in tetracycline based studies disclosed the appearance 
      of two populations of DCD: a subgroup of preserved calcification dynamics with 
      values not quite different than the NDCD group and a subgroup with a significant 
      derangement of mineralization with no measurable bone trabecular dynamics. This late 
      subgroup also showed significantly lower number of Ob/OID values compared with the 
      former with preserved calcification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Sexual influence on bone metabolism in uremic patients on regular dialytic 
      treatment.
PG  - 150-7
AB  - In order to evaluate the influence of sex on bone metabolism in patients on regular 
      dialytic treatment, 82 patients (51 males and 31 females) were studied. All the 
      women were amenorrheic and none of them took estrogens. Women showed radiological 
      features of hyperparathyroidism more frequently than men and, in addition, higher 
      bone GLA protein and lower calcitonin serum levels. In both sexes a significant 
      positive correlation was observed between PTH and BGP, but the slope was higher in 
      females, even though not significant. These results suggest that the uremic females 
      show an increased skeletal sensitivity to PTH, probably due to the lack of 
      protective effect of estrogens.
